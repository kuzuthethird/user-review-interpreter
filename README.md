# user-review-interpreter
A Python program that takes in user reviews and predicts whether the reviews are positive, negative, or neutral. NumPy was used to parse data and scikit-learn was utilized to create the machine learning model. With an advanced bag-of-words model using tf-idf, about a ~70% accuracy was achieved by making use of SVMs with the RBF kernel and one-vs-one classification.
