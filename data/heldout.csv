"Smoke shops on every corner, NO REASON TO EVER SHOP HERE. Purchased a dry and concentrate vape three months ago. When I needed a new coil I was told I had to go to another of their stores because at that store they didn't really understand their products. I went to the other store to find they didn't know which coil would work either. They said they would order some. When I went back there was a different girl and she knew ""everything"".  She sold me two coils that "" would fit"". They did not. I figured out the problem was that the manufacturer had changed the design. When I went back the same girl said I was out of luck since I probably would never find a coil for it. When I asked to return the two wrong coils she had sold me she said "" only for a store credit "" even though they were unused and it was on her advise I purchased them. Now I have a vape that is obsolete and two coils that won't fit. I looked at receipts and I have been spending an average of $50 per month at their stores but not one more dime!"
We started going here when they first opened We really liked the food. The last time we went the pizza was not very good. Burnt and hardly any thing on it. Hopefully if we go again it will be better
"""We don't do that."" - Barro's counter helper when asked on a Sunday evening when we were the only patrons sitting down to eat if she would turn up the TV and turn off the closed captions on the football game. This is a place that serves pizza, wings and beer and could be begging for a huge crowd on a Sunday. But nope, we can't accommodate your request. Although she did at least turn it from the weather to the game for us. We changed our order from dine in to 'to go' and left. The pizza had a wonderful amount of toppings but didn't appear to be the thin crust that we had ordered and we asked for the wings to be half medium and half hot but although they were boxed separately they seem to be the same. We should have asked for a manager when we were told 'no' but we just decided to write a sad review instead. The restaurant was empty, by the way. Except for people picking up orders to go. I wonder why people don't stay?"
"I use to like this place because they had lunch AYCE specials for about $5, I haven't been here for about a year. But for some reason today it was around $10. I was already there so I just paid and expected greatness.  It was slow, for the lunch time, and not much selection to pick from, and it look like its been out for a while, all dry and hard.  I ate and took my time just to see if the new stuff would ever make it out.  They  did, half a pizza, but it was all watered down, light on the toppings real light on them. Weird restaurant layout, they have a huge eating area at least a 100 people but their food area was big enough to fit a soda machine, 2 pizza, and a small salad bar.  How would it be when this place is packed?  Then again I've seen places like this have fast service before so its possible. It may seem that Cici's pizza could have stole some of their business I  think they're about $3, never tried them yet. For $10 I could have gone some place better or at least gotten 2 little Caesar pizzas. Based on pass experience I won't rate them lower."
"Came here because some friends were craving crab legs. Called our Venetian host to see if he could book us somewhere cool in the hotel for crab legs and he only had one answer, Wynn Buffet. So there we went. The wait was pretty long, but in the end it was pretty worth it. The selection looks like a lot, but don't be fooled. Each section is spread out and the serving dishes are spread out quite far as well. The main attractions I thought were the crab legs, seafood soup section, tossed caesar salad section and the meat section. For $40 on a Saturday night, it's pretty decent. Skip the sushi section unless you are from an area that doesn't have decent sushi (must be sad).  They have good service here and the dishes and food are replaced all night long. If I wasn't in such a rush to go party I'd probably have tried more. As for all buffets, don't expect too much, but this one is worth the entry fee."
"Oh my. The Wynn Buffet. I don't know if I could properly describe in words my love for this particular buffet.   Before I share my love story, I have a great tip to share with all of you that will save you some money! Come here at 3:20-3:25pm!!! I know everyone complains about the buffet prices but if you come at this time, you will be greeted with 1) no line and 2) the option to pay for lunch price. A friend tipped me off and I've done this twice already. You don't even have to argue with the cashier, she'll offer it to you. You end up paying $25 for the dinner buffet instead of $45+. Now isn't that a deal??  Ok on to the food...  My first experience here was overwhelming. There were so many things to choose from! Sometimes, it doesn't help to have a small stomach with a big appetite..not at a buffet! You get full way too fast!   I wanted the Alaskan King Crab Legs ( they serve them hot or cold!) buttered up, the shrimp, the lamb chops, the prime rib, the Lamb T-bone steak, the mussels with saffron sauce, the different cuts and types of lamb and beef and chicken, and even the salad and vegetables and soup and bread. I tried everything, there were some that I didn't like here and there but for the most part, everything was spectacular. At this point, I couldn't breathe, I literally couldn't breathe and I told my best friend I felt like throwing up because my tiny little stomach couldn't handle all of the food I had shoved down my throat.   I had to sit there and wait...and wait...and wait until my stomach would let me eat more, because God forbid I leave the Wynn without trying their desserts! Though most of their desserts are heavenly there's one dessert I dream about: the Creme Brulee. Try it, love it, dream about it.   I've tried other buffets but this one is the Wynner. If a buffet is going to make me want to throw up, not because the food is horrible but because I had a fat kid adventure and stuffed my face, then it's got to be good."
"Went to check out their apartments for a family member and can't decide what wow'd me more...the location, the amenities, the nice grassy areas, or the awesome professional down to earth staff.  I have to go with the staff. Can't tell you how many places have employees that make you feel like you are a burden. Not here!!!"
"I went here a few months ago for a special occasion. I am not concerned with the age of the other patrons. There was a very mixed crowd.  The food was great and in line with the area, service excellent and Martinis were great, but pricey.  I loved the creme brulee in the pineapple!  My only complaint was the location where we were seated and now I know better. They sat us upstairs in a room with 3 glass walls and no AC ( temperature was about 99 deg outside). There were slow moving palm ceiling fans swooshing the hot air downward. We were first seated next to a west facing window at sunset. The heat radiated to the table. We asked to be moved.  We moved to a table on the other side of the room. There was just no air movement.We got a few laughs watching 3 other couples seated at the hot west tables asking to be moved!  We enjoyed the meal, but did not want to linger in that room."
"About what you'd expect from a strip mall Chinese restaurant. Average Chinese food, but consistent. Family run restaurant."
Food ok... The service is a little inexperienced... The worst thing is when they labelled they have wifi but it was down...
"My last visit to the Vig wasn't as impressive. I'm not sure what it is, but their signature burger just doesn't seem as grand as it once did. The sweet potato fries were luke warm, and the awesome sauce that usually accompanies them is given to you in such small amounts that you have to bug your server more than once for a refill. I used to boast about this place to people seeking cool places to dine. I'm not feeling quite as enthusiastic about it these days."
Lisa does an amazing job! I've seen a few aestheticians but never really got any good results from their chemical peels. I decided to see Lisa and give a chemical peel another chance. My skin hasn't looked this good in years! I can't thank her enough!
"Parking Parking.. I always stay away from this McDonalds on weekends since it is impossible to find parking...  And even if you find one... the agony of dealing with a parking lot deal with all these drivers and shopping carts from Foody's Mart.  The newly renovated interior is really nice though...a lot of seating arrangement for groups, singles and a more private booth area in the front. A fireplace with armchairs??  24 hours drive thru can be so crazy at times!! I guess where else up here for a 3 AM snack attack up here aside from McDonalds?"
"Skip it! If i could give no stars (or) negative stars i would.  It's overpriced, and definitely NOT worth the wait.   The food was bad buffet food. It reminded me of the scene from Vegas Vacation when Clark Griswold & Cousin Eddie go to the buffet.   Food had no flavor....i didn't think you could screw up mini waffles but the batter was dry and the strawberry compote (really just strawberries in sugar syrup) didn't help the dryness. I thought maybe the prime rib would be good but it was very fatty and was dry as well. All the vegetables i tried were bendy if raw or mushy if cooked. They just couldn't seem to get anything right. The only thing that was ok were the deli meats & cheeses, but i would hate to pay the full ticket price for a buffet to only eat deli meat.   I had such high hopes since there were so many review and a very high star rating, but i was extremely disappointed.  Please don't waste your hard earned money and time."
"I loved the food, the service and the great atmosphere.  However, I also wanted to mention the personal treatment I received.  Approximately 24 hrs. after eating there I realized I had foolishly lost my credit card.  I called the restaurant to see if I had possibly left it there.  I spoke with the Manager Timothy Carlos who told me that they had found the card and secured it in their safe.  Their concern for the customer saved my vacation."
"This place is amazing! Seriously, I can't sing enough praises. We took a detour during our cross-country move and stumbled upon this gem. What an incredible find! Talk about selection -- there are 2 warehouses, a barn and a house filled with goodies so you're sure to find your own treasures. We sure did!   On top of an ENDLESS selection of antique furniture and goodies, they also have wonderful prices. Oh, and the staff is sooo friendly and helpful. We left with a mid-18th century dresser, a beautiful desk, 2 large ornate wall mirrors, and two sets of leather/wood theater seats (circa 1909). We definitely won by finding this place!"
Average in every way. Large salads but they're mostly lettuce.  The Gyro was nothing to rave about and was mostly onions and lettuce.  The pizza is mediocre and needs more flavor. The service is frequently slow.  It has a lot of potential as your local pizza spot but it just falls short.  As far as flavor the fast food pizza places are just as good.
"Every hallway smells like feces. The front desk were not helpful and had attitudes. We came across this ""hotel"" through a time share company and let me tell you that company is a scam!!! They say you get a free weekend in Vegas but didn't tell you that if you don't make their 9am meeting you will be charged $2000 for their so called meetings!! And even if you do show up they will find any excuse to have you not be a part of the meeting/tour just so they will Make that charge. The whole time share is a scam to get poor old people and dumb young people to give them money for a time share they are never gonna be able to use. I overheard on old couple complaining that they bought a time share and never had a chance to even use it. They had it for three years!! That day they were trying to get rid of it but the company wouldn't allow them. The couple even took out a loan to buy out their time share. It's sooooooooo sad what his company has done to people. They should be ashamed of themselves. AVOID THIS HOTEL AND THE TIME SHARE COMPANY. It's a scam!!!"
"This place is HUGE with plenty of furniture to see. They have one house, a barn, and another large barn type place so you should really come prepared for a couple hours here. Prices did seem a little high, but we were able to negotiate on the piece we took home."
The service made up for the food. It wasn't horrible- but not impressive at all. My crepe was a bit cold and over cooked. But the service was fast and friendly and the environment was cute and very clean
"I tried the tuna melt sliders with fries and they were ok. I expected a lot more from a David Burke restaurant, but should've known since its an airport restaurant. The bread on the tuna melt was good, but the tuna was alright. The service was also kind of weird. There was only one waitress that had too many tables, and she forgot to put in our order while everyone else after us got their food first."
"The food was adequate, as were the drinks.  It's location in the middle of a clothing store does not endear it to me either.  And to top it off, very pricey for what it was...."
"7/2/11 visited The Buffet @ Wynn for the second time.  Not sure what happened,  but the food this time was not good,  and appears the price got jacked up to $ 45.95 pp(way overpriced).    Not sure if the price increase had to do with it being the 4th of July weekend.        Below are a few of the items i sampled. Crab legs.    ok Jumbo Shimp   ok,   but should be called small shrimps, compared to the large shrimps @ the bellagio buffet sui mai   ok crepe deserts with strawberry/chocolate filing ( sadly,best part of meal). hot/sour thailand soup,    cold antipasto.     ok asian fried noodle   not much flavor  I will not be visited The Buffet @ the Wynn again.  I should had stuck with my favorite buffet in Vegas, which the  The Buffet @ The Bellagio,   which is hands down the best,  with their  decent price, Huge Selection and consistently good food ."
Food was average and my bun for my chicken sandwich was still frozen. But what really upset us was the service. The girl taking our order was still texting on her phone. Probably the laziest set of workers I've ever seen on this busy Sunday.  We're locals up here and we keep trying this place. It's just plain awful. The staff is so lazy they never have any meat cooked.
"I'd have to say this place is mediocre at best. Sesame chicken, kung pao chicken, and egg fried rice... I give all 2 stars, mostly because they really didn't have much flavor. Honestly it was probably the worst sesame chicken I've ever had but it was edible with some doctoring up. It was also pretty over priced for the quality. The 3rd star is just because they deliver, that's always a plus."
"The pizza is delicious! They have vegan and gluten free options, the staff is always  friendly and attentive. This is a beautiful location and I love the outdoor patio. However, it really bothers me that smoking seems to be allowed on the outdoor patio/eating area.....Cigarette smoke is the last thing I wanna smell while I'm eating!!!! They also have a pitiful dessert menu - i think they only offer one dessert. The appetizers, pizza and sides are great though!"
"If you have any clothes at Oxford Cleaners on Riggs Rd in Chandler, they're gone.  The store is empty and the phone just rings non stop. I should have been suspicious when I had to pay in advance. I lost about $200.00 worth of clothes."
"When you're in Vegas, you have to do at least one buffet. My favorite buffet is still Bacchanel Buffet at Caesar's Palace. I've lined the long but fast moving lines here once for dinner and this trip for lunch.   The lunch selection is vast, with salads, Italian station, craving station, ethnic foods, such as Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, comfort foods, desserts of course, and everything ranging from hot to cold foods. There's a little bit of something for everyone. Our vegetarian friend had more of a food selection here and at buffets in general compared to other food venues in Vegas.   I've tried a little bit of everything and some of the selections are good, and some are mediocre, but none are that great. I also tend to gravitate towards the ethnic foods and I have to say, the dumplings with the chili oil is pretty descent. The poke is descent but nothing similar if you've had a good bowl of this Hawaiian style raw fish salad. The marinated short ribs were descent as well but I think they could have done a better job with the flavors. It's sad to waste such a good piece of meat.  And I did like the smoked salmon as it was perfect with capers, horseradish, and whole grain mustard.   I actually enjoyed the desserts more this time and some of my favorites included the guava panna cotta and mango tapioca. I tend to also try the more exotic desserts. So always make room for dessert! I left with a candy apple, as I've been eyeing it all day. Let's just say the dyed candy red left my teeth and lips red with its artificial dye and I regret eating it. No more candy apples, but good desserts."
"Of all the Love's truck stops I stopped at ... this was by far the nicest and had the friendliest people on staff.  I only got gas for my 26' truck - so can't comment on any of their additional amenities - except their bathroom was very clean and well maintained.  The cashier who assisted me was friendly and very knowledgeable.  That's when I found out that I was paying a higher price for gas because I was gassing up at the TRUCK bays ... and that diesel was cheaper out front.  I didn't know that ... I had been paying a ROAD TAX all the way to this point.  It was easy access just off the I-10 in Chandler, AZ ... just south of Phoenix."
"I love the buffet at the Wynn! OMG i've had the buffet at Bellagio, monte carlo paris and etc.  None of them can beat the Wynn's buffet. It was amazing.  I know trust me usually food at the buffet is all about quality and no quantity, but here at the Wynn it was delicious.  Every food item was made with care and love.  You can see it. Everything tasted perfect.  I wish i can come back soon!"
"I stayed here for a week with my family as part of a timeshare agreement. We had a two bedroom place with a kitchen and living room.  Regarding the room, it felt a bit old and dingy but you're not really in Vegas to stay in your room for too long, so I guess I didn't mind as much. The master bedroom and walk-in closet were ridiculously large, so you can definitely lounge out there. The other bedroom was smaller but it still had a TV there too.  The in-room wifi was pretty bad. It seemed to kick me off every so often and I'd have to re-login. The connectivity was also spotty at best. I sometimes found myself connecting to the Cosmopolitan Wifi despite their weak signal.  The downstairs has a hospitality lounge where you can get free popcorn (delicious, buttery popcorn), free coffee, and access to their business computers and printers. I found the computers and printers to be useful when it came time to print show tickets and airline boarding passes.  There are some shuttles that go off campus to various places, like the Premium Outlets South and Fremont. Check the schedule for more details because they don't run everyday and they run at different times.  The location of the building itself is interesting. It's a small building nestled next to the Cosmopolitan. In fact, there is a way to get into the Cosmopolitan building without going outside, but it's a little tricky to find.  From the outside you have to go down a long alleyway to get to the Jockey Club front door. The alleyway feels a little sketchy and it stinks because there are pipes from the sewer or something. I find that walking on the provided walkway to the Strip was better.  Anyway, would I stay here again? Maybe. The location is really nice since it's right across the street from Planet Hollywood, right next to Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio, and just overall can easily access most things on the Strip."
It was OK definitely not a fan of the $15  tacos. For tacos. Seriously. But they were awesome. And food taste was good. Just a bit over priced for small meals
I went there and I ordered a large rare beef to go came hone and I had 3 pieces of meat and almost no been sprouts I was pissed I called and complaining because obviously I was hungry and I wanted more than three pieces of meat she said oh well the chef put the same amount of meat for all of them so I got even more mad nice excuse me I paid for a large you're telling me that they put the same amount and regardless of the size so why would I be paying for a large and getting a small you're ripping people off she wouldn't do anything for me saying I'm not in control I can't do anything next time I'll just give you more meat I want it was so mad Plus to make matters worse my boyfriend went and walked into the kitchen and it was filthy there was literally a bowl of meat sitting on the floor it was disgusting boy caught it I swear to God I will never ever ever ever again it is disgusting and they are rude and they rip you off I wish I could knew how to delete my old review
They always take about 2 days and have ruined 3 of my husband's very expensive dress shirts and of course refused to take responsibility for it. Luckily Macy's was kind enough to replace even though it wasn't their fault at all. They had a different excuse each time for why it wasn't their fault
"I came here autumn of '07.  The service was IMPECCABLE.  Otherwise I would really just give this place 2 stars.  My bone in ribeye tasted a tad funny on the edges.  It tasted like...the fridge =X  It was gross.  They give you a HUGE steak though, more than enough to share with another person.  Problem is...who gets the end pieces? XD  My bf got the prime rib and thought it was okay.  Nothing special.  I tried it, I agree.  Haha, he'd rather go to Outback XD  My friend's mac & cheese was very good =d  And the broccolini was also very good.  The complimentary bread was okay, except for the bitter fig pieces...weird o.o;;  We had the strawberry tree dessert.  Apparently my friends had gotten that earlier in the year and the strawberries were HUGE =d  Wasn't so for the autumn =T  They could, at the very least, have given us more strawberries to compensate *SIGHS*  And the white chocolate and ""dark"" (more like milk) chocolate dips were much too sweet and lumpy...???  So for 2 giant prime ribs (not dry aged), 1 bone in ribeye (not dry aged), 1 order of mac & cheese, 1 order of broccolini, and the strawberry tree came out to a little over $200.  For the food, price, and the fact that they're supposed to be a  ""high class"" restaurant - 2 stars.  For their service - I want to give this place 2 stars because I was very impressed but I can't bring myself to give this place an overall rate of 4 stars =("
"was here over the weekend for dinner.  have not had a buffet in vegas for many years but finally gave in and tried the Wynn.  $45 including tax and tip for dinner in vegas is a fair deal.  prime rib was very tender and my favorite dish.  had a few lamb lollipops also which was cooked perfectly but the seasoning on it was not my favorite for lamb.  it left an orange oily film on my plate.  the asian food selection was pretty good also but the sushi selection was lacking.  only a few roll selections and no sashimi.  for $45, i expected some faw fish.  the crab legs were not king crab.  it was tasty but skinny long legs were not as meaty as i like.  i like the big chunks u get from king crab.  there was a large selection of dessert but not outstanding.  i tried 5 different things and the best was a basic gelato.  very refreshing for an end to the meal.  the Buffet at Wynn is worth a try but it was not good enuf for a return visit."
We purchased bottle service and had a great time! Our host and server were great. We got a center location in the middle of the dance floor. The club was packed and music was awesome! Would definitely go again.
"This place was such a disappointment!  I read all the reviews, did my homework but Eva failed on this one.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt that the restaurant itself is beautiful but the food, service and prices are horrible.  YUCK!"
"one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes...  Celebrated NYE in Vegas & spent most of New Year's Day recovering. The girlfriend & I managed only one meal that day, the Buffet at the Wynn. As far as buffets go, there was a good variety of food, most of it was good, some of it very good, a few things not so much. Also as far as buffets go, the Wynn was pricey. But considering that an overindulgence such as this ended up being a whole day's food intake, maybe the price isn't so bad after all. Hey, it's a buffet, need I say more?"
"I love this Starbucks for their service as I love all of them for that.  This atmosphere is very cozy. Wish they could move to a larger spot, but I don't think there's room in the shopping center for this location."
I LOVE LOVE LOVE Shamika! She is a genius stylist! She gave me a great hair cut with beautiful highlights & low~lights. My husband never notices anything I ever do to my hair. But he noticed this time! And the compliments were flowing... Thanks Shamika
"For a few years they've been really good on their delivery, but I'm getting tired of their lack of customer consideration.  Nobody ever answers the phone like they want, or care about, your business.  They sound bored and uninterested.  But the food is usually good and delivery is usually pretty quick.  However, they never tell you on the phone when to expect your food or even how much it's going to be.  All the other places we call for delivery are considerate enough to let you know when to expect your food and how much to expect to pay.  Recently we ordered some delivery --- I asked when I should expect the food and I was told 45 minutes.  An hour later I called to get an update --- it had been raining all day and the guy who took my order seemed really unsure about how to spell my street name, even though they've been here several times before.  I was told they were busy and the delivery should be here in fifteen minutes.  Twenty minutes after that call, I called back to see what's going on.  If they're lost, they're lost, you know?  Maybe I can help get the guy here.  I'm told that they're busy and it's been raining, so..... you know?  No, I don't know.  I know it was raining when I placed the order, so if you're that busy, then tell me it's going to be an hour and not 45 minutes.  If your guy is lost, then tell me, or call me and let me know he's lost.  My family is waiting an hour and 20 minutes at this point.  At this point it doesn't make sense for them to even show up.  It's embarrassing for them to even walk up to my door with, what I presume, is going to be cold food.  If they made my food an hour ago, then it's been in this guy's car since then and I don't want it.  Or did they make it an hour ago?  Did they lose my order and not tell me?  Has the delivery guy been out delivering this whole time and he's just hopelessly behind on deliveries?  I decided to wait to see when --- IF --- he would show up.  We made a pizza.  Two hours and ten minutes after the initial order there is a ring at the door.  And then the guy just starts leaning on the door bell.  I barely have time to get up from the table and walk down the hall and he's rung the bell five or six times.  Yeah, that's annoying --- you're the guy who's over an hour late and now you're being just being a jerk.   I opened the door with a slice of pizza in my hand.  He tried to hand me my food while telling me how much it's going to be.... wait, where have you been?  We made pizza!  Is the food even warm?  Yes, it's fresh and warm ... so when did you make it?  An hour ago?  Two hours ago?  Twenty minutes ago?  He doesn't know.  Did you get lost?  No? Well we're only five miles from the restaurant --- where have you been?  I didn't get any good answers --- not even an apology.  But I did get a steep, steep discount on my (somewhat) warm food.  If you had to wait two hours for your food to come out in the restaurant, what would you do?  Wait ... what do you mean you wouldn't wait two hours for your food to come out in a restaurant?  You'd want an apology or some kind of feasible explanation, wouldn't you?  I got neither of those things.    What almost certainly happened is the order was lost or sent to someone else ----- so it had to be made again.  That's fine with me because I want fresh food, but don't try to BS me in some lame fashion about the weather or something else.  Be straight with me so I can make dinner plans ---- start playing games with me and I'll start looking at other options and then I'll come on Yelp and tell everyone what a lame business you run."
"The classic burger was quite good although I personally would have enjoyed a smaller bun. Excellent asian beef soup, beet salad was great and sliders were as good as the burger. Place is noisy with suits yapping loudly anoutht their business. Service was ok could use for some more attentive serving staff. Lunch for two (no booze) with an appetizer was a bit rich. Just under one hundred with tip."
The server upstairs was both beautiful and intelligent;  she helped us find a place to sit after I messed up on our reservations. Our waitress at the bar section (dyed blonde hair that was up in a pony tail) was extremely patient with me as I tried to figure out what to eat. I fell head over heels for my bisque soup!!! Too bad we ordered sandwiches because that was good but pretty standard. I can't wait to go back and try out some real dinners.
"Nice looking shop, however if you are looking for a professional cut, keep looking.  Save your money and go to a chain.  I stopped in on a slow weekday and the barber sitting on his chair was texting on his phone and took more than enough time to notice a customer, I felt like apologizing and leaving.  There were two other employees who came out of the back and started chatting about their weekend and didn't have any problems with vulgar language, including a female employee, so heads up if you want to bring your kids here.  One of the barbers even took the opportunity to trim his own hair while he was cutting the hair of a customer.  This place is close to my house but I will drive further for a more professional and deserving shop for my business.  If you just need a simple cut, without concern of your look and want to pay more than what it's worth and feel like a burden to the employees, this is your shop."
"I'm giving it 3 stars because the atmosphere and vibe was awesome. I loved the little courtyard area. We only came for drinks, so I can't comment on the food. The beer menu was pretty weak. They didn't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor."
"Like any club in Vegas or LA, if you get bottle service, you get in real quick. Fortunately my girlfriend's friend had one on a Friday night and we happen to have a higher girl to guy ratio. The place is cool, pretty big and of course has a great sound system. The bathrooms attendants are very nice and even without tips, they'll offer you some gum on the way out. I think all Vegas clubs are very similar, they just blast EDM music now and like I said if you have a table or a high girl to guy ratio, entrance could be fairly easy. Drinks are about $15 per at the bar and although I didn't see the bottle service bill, I am sure it was anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 a bottle. But you are in Vegas, you are supposed to lose money right?   Overall, its a fun spot.  Every Vegas club has its time in the spotlight, so I guess Hakkasan is in right now."
"Mmmm! You have got to love being able to drop in and for under $5 get a huge slice of pizza, a soda and a salad.  For some reason the pizza always tastes better from the warmer! The chicken hawaiin pizza? HELLO HEAVEN!"
"JODY,  VICKY, CAZ,  thanks for a lovely arty evening. I thoroughly enjoyed the amazing sandwiches with ham, salad and cheese, the LEFFE beer, J2 apple and raspberry juice and the dessert cupcake. Whoohu. I also had a fun evening painting my plate with spirals and my cup with stripes. Colours,  colors.... Well, Hmmm, our pens seemed to disappear :-)  People had painted some amazing forms and figures. There was so much talent!  Vicky was great explaining what the Hill House design studio is used for. There are 7 studios and a workshop.  All of the rooms can be hired. A desk in a studio costs you £150/month and the studio would cost you £70 for half a day rental. Not bad, I say, for this location near George Street.  The are several workshops available and you can check out what they offer on craft workshops online.   Tonight was a very relaxing atmosphere.  Just perfect!"
"Went this last week ! Food was great! And while it wasn't packed it took an hour and 1/2 for lunch at 1:30 ! Won't be back real soon ! Offered no explanation about how everyone around us got their late lunch , and we waited ! To many other choices !"
"Andrea does the best Brazilian Blowouts in the Phoenix area.  I know this because - after moving from Ohio and leaving my stylist of 10 years - I tried several other salons/stylists prior to finding her.  Andrea's Brazilian's last a long time and are reasonably priced when compared with others. She is thorough and proud of her work, and she is ""on point"" every time I have a new request for a different cut or color. She is a pleasure to talk with, and I am lucky to have found her! I HIGHLY recommend Andrea!"
One of the top 3 buffets in Vegas! You can bet you'll have to wait 40+ minutes for dinner or weekend brunch. Great selection of high quality ethnic foods and even had crab legs and poki.
"Best mojitos by far. Like, ever. I love the whole Tommy Bahama thing anyways (food, furniture, clothes, decor, etc). I always feel like I am on vacation there. The drinks are the best. The meals are okay. They have a decent ahi tuna salad. This is how you do it right. Go on a nice spring day, sit outside at the patio bar, go with a pal (I worked in Kierland for awhile, so this was like my after work hang out) order a mojito or margarita, order appetizers like the coconut shrimp or the macadamia nut goat cheese, and get a slice of the best dessert ever created: the pina colada cake. Literally, the best cake in the world. I order a whole one (like $60... YIKES!!!) every year from my moms birthday. You gotta order those in advance! Seriously, it will be my wedding cake."
"Always good food. Entire family loves it. Super busy at night. I love the ranch dressing. They have great lunch specials. 6 bucks for a slice of pizza, salad, drink."
"My husband and I wanted to dine but decided to just have two quick drinks at the bar when we discovered very unprofessional behavior by two bartenders. They weren't wearing name tags, they were working 04-11-14 at 8:30 PM. The two males one Caucasian and one Spanish were both drinking on the job, they were more interested in their bro talk and drinking activites than engaging and servicing the customers. Also I lost my appetite when I saw the Spanish gentleman return a customers plate to the kitchen and he seriously ate a huge piece of food off of the plate when he closed the door. Management watch these guys on video I'm sure their behavior is much worse, i was only there for twenty minutes. I would make sure they aren't stealing money too."
"This place doesn't even deserve a 1 star. I expected a lot more for a nice, new hotel.  Horrible service! Gourmet food but nothing stood out. Not worth the money. $30-40 a person."
"Some colleagues and I suggested to go get some Pho for an early lunch. We got there just before 11am and were the only people there. Service was quick and food came quick (obviously).  Atmosphere: Cute, intimate & fresh.  Cleanliness: tables, chairs, cutlery & dishes were in good condition. Constructive criticism: for the servers to have more knowledge on their items they serve. One colleague asked how their item of interest was prepared, and she didn't know.  Cuisine: Vietnamese  Facilities: needs a good painting and deep cleaning. Looks grimy. Food: For appetizers, my colleagues and I ordered the Spring Rolls. There was 4 rolls on this platter. 2 made with grilled pork, and 2 vegetable. The rolls were rather large but the server brought us as scissor to cut in half. This was my second time eating Pho. The portion sizes at this location are large, and the quality of the food is excellent! I ordered The Pho Tai Bo Vien which is Rare Beef & Beef Ball soup. I added two limes and Sriracha hot sauce making this uber tasty.  Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: I will definitely return. This is a great place for Vegetarians too! I trust their meat quality and freshness of produce.  Parking: Private Portion Sizes: filling! my soup was Large. Next time I will order the smaller size serving because I had too much broth left over.  Price: my Large soup was $9.00. My spring/fresh rolls were $7.50 Service: only 1 waitress working. Asked a few times for drinks and she seemed forgetful. She didn't come once to our table to check or ask if our meals were good or if we needed any beverage refills. Selection: wide variety. If you don't see it on the menu, just ask. Chefs are flexible."
"I have used this cleaners for over 10 years now. I have always been very pleased with their work. They do a beautiful job and are always on time. I had an expensive cream leather jacket that had a red stain on it. They were able to get it out. I've had alterations done there several times and have always been very pleased with how well the clothes fit. The people are very friendly. Summer has always gone out of her way to give me great service. The prices are reasonable, too. I have a cleaners that is closer to my home now, but I will continue to drive the extra miles to use this one."
"Super disappointed during my visit last night. Made a reservation, on the patio, 2 weeks ago for a dinner meeting... get to the host stand and the host just stares blankly at me and says there's no reservation. Oookkaaay? No apology, no sense of customer service. So we get stuck seated inside which has terrible acoustics, not great for a meeting.  Service was slow, food was ok."
Nice gingery dense thin waffles. Standard fried chicken. Didn't live up to the hype.
A decent restaurant for the airport. Had the vegetarian tofu one.... I was really very hungry and I enjoyed this hott freshly prepared meal !!! Very satisfying
"Zax is a wholesome little lunch place up in the northern Phoenix area.  When you walk in, it's a little bit overwhelming, but reminds me of a place that my grandma may have been hired to decorate.  There is tons of picnic table-style seating, various nic-nacks, and a TV playing TV land episodes at the forefront of the seating area - strange but it works!  The place was packed at lunch but I will admit they were QUICK at taking my order.  I would recommend calling ahead because it can take about 10-15 minutes for the food to be ready.  Prices are reasonable - 5-6 bucks for a delicous sandwich, and they also have entrees like chicken tenders, lasagne, and spaghetti that are $6.95 a piece - reasonable!  If you work in a relaxed environment, you can also grab a mid-day bottle of beer, wine, or for those of us in corporate America - one of many assorted energy drinks."
"It's nice but nothing fancy. If you are looking for something cheap and close to the ASU campus, look no more. No major complaints. I do enjoy the quiet community and the fact that when the gate works, it's a somewhat gated community. All in all not bad."
"This is one of those places that has solid food, though the service and the way everything is set up leaves a lot to be desired.  Essentially, this is the place that moved into the building where Villa Pizza's old location was. As such, I had high hopes for it. In some ways this place hits the mark, and it some ways it falls short.  Firstly, the positives. While I have not eaten here a whole lot, I am pleased to say that all of the food I have had in there has been excellent. During my visit tonight I have a cheese calzone, which is definitely one of the most delicious I have ever had. What few other items I have eaten here have been good as well, including many of the pasta dishes. I have noticed other reviews bashing the food here, but I have never had a bad meal here. The counter staff that we dealt with were all friendly and professional.  Of course, with a three-star rating, as you expected, there are bound to be some negatives. During our whole meal, right behind us, a group of employees (presumably the family that owns the restaurant) was arguing loudly over who gets what days off and what their plans for the Fourth of July were going to be. This was totally unprofessional and inappropriate. If you're going to have these arguments, step outside or go in the back room. You DO NOT do this in front of your customers. Again, the staff I dealt with at the front counter were all friendly and did their job well, but this group of people in the back corner needs to learn a thing or two about what constitutes professional behavior in the workplace.  The other issue I have is that, while this is a ""dine in"" restaurant, you have to go up to the counter and order, and get your own drinks. When I get off work and am tired, I like to be served. This is more annoying than helpful. There is not a large printed menu so you have to get one of the little paper ones to find what you want. This just seems like an outdated way of doing business in a place like this, and is a disappointment. This is a shame, as the food is very good.  Overall, this place is not all that it could be, but the food is solid and it is worth stopping in if you are in the neighborhood. Hopefully you will not have to deal with loud and unprofessional staff arguments when you go in."
"Would have liked to try you guys, but after 20 minutes your phone line is still busy. I called another location and was told that one of the perverts would contact this location about the issue. I tried several more time before ordering from a competitor. I called back after placing my order elsewhere and the line was still busy. You can't do business if your customers can't reach you."
a lot of things to choose from. prices vary from great bargain to way over priced.  My tip is if you are looking for something in particular (say costume) shop online to check prices before going so you can compare!  FOR INSTANCE- we were looking for werewolf fangs- here they were around $30+ i think and i didnt get them. instead i bouth them online for $11 plus a few bucks shiping
"Reliable and good is the word that comes to mind. Always reliably good. Good (and large) Margaritas and martinis; reliably very tasty food (the ribs are great, and so are the chicken dishes) and servers are very knowledgeable and well trained. The only negative if it is one at all is that the menu could be updated more often. I have been going to tommy bahama for years and the menu is pretty much the same it always has been. But that also means they still have my favorites there."
This is my go to bank because of the excellent service they provide.   Kay is a great teller.  All the guys are great.  The Manager Hans goes above and beyond. He is always there to help.  I am glad that I found you.  Dawn
"Disappointing.  That's the takeaway from here. If they didn't steal all these big-name DJs for the next 1.5 years, they would have no one coming. Since it wasn't built from scratch, you can tell it has age. There is no outdoor area which I feel is a new standard for Vegas clubs. Everything is small and enclosed. The drink prices are standard Vegas, but they charge you $9 for the smallest bottle of Fiji water and refused to acknowledge that there is free water unless you specifically say ""give me tap water"".  The dance floor is small and so when a performer comes on you don't get much of a view (although DJs don't really do much so I guess that's ok.) Also main headliners don't come on until 1:30AM so be aware of that. We came for Bingo Players and so the crowd was probably a little thinner; the upstairs 5th floor bar/table area was pretty spacious so we ended up there.   The feel and vibe of the place is more like Haze or Tao. I definitely prefer Marquee, XS or Surrender because of the outdoors. Really this wasn't a terrible club but given all the hype, waiting and cost of tickets, I was very disappointed. Once their headliners are off contract and move on, I imagine this place will be old news very quickly."
"Every time I go to Vegas, someone always suggests ""This hotel has the best buffet!!!"" and every time I end up being disappointed. However, I wouldn't say I was totally disappointed but I wasn't amazed either. The food wasn't really different than any other buffet except the food looked more expensive...if that makes sense. I think maybe because it was the brunch but who knows. The wait wasn't very long and we went exactly at noon.   Everyone in the party loved the congee and it was just ok for me. I thought the ""bacon"" (not the regular bacon but the bacon carved next to the prime rib) was really tasty but very fatty. But who doesn't like bacon...amirite?!!?!"
"Nice milk tea, bubble tea, & hot tea.  I would not eat there. Their food is too greasy & salty.  I usually just pop in to get a drink.  Good for meeting up with friends if they are into bubble tea."
"I had bought a lighter/torch along with some other things and spent over $70. I went home, tried to push down the ignite button and it wouldn't go down. I went back on Sunday to see what they would do. I was informed by the employee that they have a no return policy and the manager would ""take it out of his paycheck"" and made me feel like my money wasn't as important as his. I've bought countless glass, cigarettes, and other items from here but it's needless to say I will not be going back and telling my friends and family to stay away from here."
Says they deliver and they're open until midnight. But when i called an hour and a half before they close at 10:30 they said they don't deliver passed at a certain time. They just lost $50 and a potential regular.
"The guys from Dignity Moving were fast, efficient, friendly and careful with all of our items! Great team and great price, will definitely refer them to friends and family!"
"My fascination with this club started waaaay before it even opened. My husband did the demolition of Studio 54 and some of the construction for Hakkasan, so I was intrigued to see what the final product was all about.   As I've mentioned in other of my reviews, my ""weekend"" consists of Wednesdays and Thursdays, so since Hakkasan is closed on Wednesday, I assume it was not as crowded on a Thursday as it is on Saturdays. The nights that I have gone, locals are free, not sure what they charge typically, but free is GREAT! Their resident DJ's are great! I've seen Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Tommy Trash, Nervo, R3hab, Above and Beyond, and Fergie DJ, always a good time!   As for the negatives. The layout is interesting, like many have said, TONS of stairs. But they DO have elevators, which I've been taking advantage of more often now! As for the main EDM room, it's always packed, either they let in too many people in or they come in from different rooms all at the same time. There are times when the club is so overcrowded and hot that it seems like you can barely breathe! Talk about a fire hazard! Expect typical Vegas prices for drinks; a Grey Goose and Redbull for 28.00 and water for 9.00 is what I've come across =/"
Allows way over capacity in their club. You can't even move! Unsafe and wreck less! The music wasn't great. The service was non existent. Servers just stood around. I could have gone to a better club at home.
"This place has the best pho I ever had since I come to Toronto. It was recommended by a friend, who is a food guru.   What I like:  -The broth: I find that most of pho broth are bit too salty. after I had my pho I need to drink lots of water. However, this place's broth has the right amount of taste. Plus, broth is the key to a good pho, or vermicelli soup.   -The garnish: (or whatever you'd call them) this is the only place that I have been so far that offers mint and cabbage for the pho! I love putting mint into the soup, it gives an extra flavor to the soup.   -The cleanness: the place is not that big, but it looks clean. The place went through a renovation and it looks so much brighter and cleaner. I specially like the way how the waitress put the chopsticks and the spoons into a bottle of hot water.   I personally like the following dishes: - Spring rolls (very very crispy_ -fried butter chicken wings (Juicy, and butterly tasty) -vietnam style pancake   What's else:  -You can't really comment on the service, you know why,  - I don't like the fact that there are tables right besides the washroom (this is just personal preference). -It has 4 sizes for pho. -The noodle. I know from a Vietnamese friend, that the noodle for the pho should be wide, not thin. The only place that I know that offers noodle similar to those that serve in Vietnam  is pho xe lua (in chinatown)."
"Service was great! Food not soo, I ordered the Romaine salad and all it was, was a that a romaine Head for 12.00 my friend ordered the Tortilla soup- what a joke! We were trying to watch what we ate considering we were in cute dresses ready to dance at her club and didn't want to over stuff ourselves. Margarita was 20.00. They charge you for your glass of water which you don't even ask for they just bring to you a whooping $4 bucks! Oh I forgot I ordered baby clams as an Appetizer they were the size of a penny!"
"First off, the driver overcharged my order to ensure he had a tip and thinking it was a mistake by the restaurant I felt sorry for him and gave him a tip. In checking the receipt and that he had just left I realized what had happened. I had also asked for all vegetarian dishes and one of them came in with beef and the rest of the order was just disappointing. I will never order from this restaurant again."
We decided to have an early Mother's Day dinner here and it was a great decision. Atmosphere was relaxed and breezy! You truly feel like you are on vacation somewhere on a tropical island!
"HORRIBLE!!!!! Not only did they mess up our delivery order, when we called to get it corrected the owner told us we would have to come to the restaurant and bring the messed up order and he would remake the order. When I asked to have the delivery charge waived since we would have to come there he said he wasn't going to argue with me and didn't need our business. (We ordered noodles and he sent us pork fried rice which we cannot eat under any circumstance). He then had the audacity to tell me we didn't order the noodles.  He ended up sending a driver to come get the food for me to get a refund instead of making the correct order and picking up the wrong one. If i could leave a negative star I would. I have never been treated this way by a restaurant in my life. Not only have they lost my business but my family and friends and I will be sure to tell as many people as possible."
"Macaroons were hard and dry, took one bite and threw away. Cute shop. Disappointed"
"Service and atmosphere nice but food over priced and really bad mexican. Burrito not wrapped right, seafood enchilada awful,  chili reanno soggy. Rice tàsteless, refried beans ftom a can."
"Stayed at the Wynn for a few days and after winning 2 sets of 2 to the buffet we decided to try it out for breakfast. The buffet opens at 8:00. The first day we went we showed up at 9:20 and were seated at 10:55. By the time we got to the food there was barely any breakfast left and what was left was being pulled out and swapped for lunch left and right. Today we decide to go at 7:40 to ""get in line"" so we don't have to wait and the line is again through all the queues with people just waiting to get in. What is the deal with this place? You have to show up and wait for the buffet to open at like 7:00?? Basically if you come here your waiting. Whether it's before they open or while they're open. Oh and if you come anytime after 9:15 don't expect breakfast even if it runs till 11:00.  Bonus our servers were nice and the food was OK but after our experiences here and with the Wynn in general we would not come back."
"Okay,  I hate to give this business two stars because I have been a fan since they came to vegas. However, for the past year, my order is either cancelled or postponed for an extra hour because they do not have a stable delivery driver. -_- Really? Hire someone who comes in on time or actually shows up because I would like to remain a loyal customer."
"My partner and I were asked to sit for a timeshare which we normally decline but since I got off work early we decided to take advantage of the benefits of living in Las Vegas. After talking to the kiosk attendant for 30 minutes, driving to the location and sitting in the waiting area (1.5 hours total) we were told we did not qualify to take the tour because we did not have linked accounts. This is information the salesperson at the kiosk knew but apparently prospective customers time is not valuable at The Jockey Club. Additionally, when they finally sent someone to tell us we were not qualified, after they had taken our personal information twice and and had been 'verified', a staff member directed us to a side hallway and apologized because she had to pull us aside as if we were going to make a scene because apparently that happens all the time. Maybe they should take the hint. The whole thing seems counterproductive. They have the presentations to get people to try to stay at Jockey Club or Cosmo (lmfao) but then their first impression is garbage. Don't stay here and hopefully you read this before getting tricked into giving up personal info that they will probably sell."
"My front yard sprinkler system wouldn't shut off one morning so I called my plumbers at Sav-On Plumbing who recommended Manning for the job. I hadn't really found a good sprinkler service to use, always relying on landscapers and such. I also like to try working with local, family owned businesses who are often less expensive than the big chains but value your business more and work to keep it, so I wasn't opposed with giving them a try. I was very pleased with my experience all the way around. The gentleman who fielded my call and made the appointment had a full understanding of what I was telling him. They were flexible fitting me in the next day, providing a 2/hr window of arrival. I was called when they were on their way and the situation was quickly diagnosed. They charge by the hour but were up front with their rates. I wanted to keep the work under $200 and they came in at just over half of that. Everything was tested before they left and I was told to call if anything goes south with the work they performed (which took about 1/hr to complete). If further work ever needs done on my sprinkler systems, I wouldn't hesitate using Manning Sprinkler Services again."
"I agree with the other reviews that the sides are lacking, specially in flavor. Pork and brisket were surprisingly good and I really liked the chipotle BBQ sauce."
"I thought the pizza we ordered was mediocre at best.  The crust wasn't outstanding and the cheese was rubbery.  The tomatoes on the bruschetta, on the other hand, were fresh and flavorful.  I could taste the garlic and olive oil.  It was a shame that the toast it came on was as stale as the day is long....  I have had better pizza in Charlotte."
"I would give them 3 1/2 stars. The food was overall solid but not the best. I guess I was expecting a little bit more because everyone in the Phoenix area told me that I needed to go here and that the food was hella good. Don't get me wrong, like I said before the food is solid. The service was really good and the staff was very friendly, real good people. But if you are in the Phoenix area and looking for a home cooked style meal, I would recommend them."
"Meh normal party store but don't expect help.  Or even if you are lucky enough to get help,  don't expect them to be nice. My advice is to get what you need and go. Terrible customer service"
"This place made my Vegas trip! We got in without paying cover because we ran into a promoter. I enjoyed the second floor, the Pavilion, the best. It is over priced for drinks, which is why I am not giving it 5 stars, but i definitely recommend going to Hakkasan."
"My friends and I came to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party. We stayed in a timeshare at the Jockey Club for 3 nights. The Jockey Club is attached to the Cosmopolitan and within a 5-10 minute walk to the Bellagio and Caesars Palace.   The day we arrived, our room wasn't supposed to be ready until 4:00pm. Since our flight was early, we decided to check at the hotel to see if our room was ready early. We were very pleased to see our room was ready around 1:00pm. The only complaint I have is that our room did not quite look like the pictures. In the photos it seemed a lot bigger. However, the rooms/bathrooms were clean and professional. There were two queen beds in one room, one queen bed in another room, a living room area attached to the kitchen, and two bathrooms. (We rented from Airbnb so I have no idea what the other rooms here look like.)  FYI, if you do decide to stay at the Jockey Club, be aware that (normally) Uber and Lyft drivers are not aware of where it is. It is attached to the Cosmopolitan (more like behind the Cosmopolitian) and you can't see the Jockey Club entrance to the hotel from the strip. You have to turn in front of the Cosmopolitan and drive down an alley to get to the front entrance of the Jockey Club where you check in. This caused a few issues because we had to walk to the ""ride share"" pickup area at the Cosmopolitan in order to be picked up by Uber.   Also, when we were leaving the hotel we had to be out of our room by 10:00am but our flight wasn't until 2:00pm. The staff was very accommodating/friendly and held our luggage for us until we left. Overall, it was a good experience and I would stay here again."
"When I went to pick up the items a week ago, my skirt was TRASHED!! And they did NOTHING about it.  It was my favorite skirt -- I splurged and spent almos 200.00 on this beautiful skirt !!   When I told them I would never return,  The owner told me that she didn't need my 75.00 weekly business because she had customers that spent 500.00.  Rude! Hostile ! Unprofessional !!! Never ever use this cleaner!!! Read the previous review about summer.  I had a similar experience with her ! Awesome how you treat your customers, summer"
"I am new to town, so of course I was looking for a new salon. I decided to go to whatever salon had two openings that day, for my boyfriend and I. They were slow that day, we went into see Gina. I am very picky about my hair. I have only had one person actually give me a hair cut I was happy about. I told Gina kind of what I wanted and to play with it how she saw fit. My boyfriend had no idea what he wanted. Gina did a fabulous job on both of our hair!! We were so happy when we left, she gave us good conversation, very friendly, and a great hair cut. I hardly ever give a place 5 stars, but I loved the décor, the level of comfort they supply, and of course Gina and our fabulous hair.   PS they also sold us a product, not tested on animals and it does actually help style our hair."
"Usually not the best customer service but, great pizza!"
"I just stopped in there today looking for a sweet treat.  I picked up a truffle, a turtle and a cupcake.  If I just would have had the cupcake I would have given it 5 stars.  That was a seriously good cupcake.  I had the black & white cupcake; a simple chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream frosting.  The cake was dense, rich, moist and not too sweet which was the perfect compliment to the sweet and rich buttercream frosting.  I will be back when the cupcake mood hits.  Unfortunately the candy fell a little flat.  The truffle was massive and just too sweet even though it was salted caramel.  I also asked for a pecan turtle but when I got home the nuts were actually almonds and there were only 4 nuts on corners of the large turtle.  Sadness turtle.  Candy gets 1 star and I wound up pitching half of it.  To sum up: come for the cupcakes (and probably the other baked goods) but be leery of the candy."
"This restaurant is ok. I've been there plenty of times for drinks (mostly because my friends like it there and it's pretty close to the Cineplex) and all the time I was almost satisfied. I've tried their food few times. In many instances the taste was OK (nothing memorably good) but the portions are pretty small. Quality varies.  Last time I went for food, they gave me a dish that was rice soup + chicken + vegetables. First two parts were OK as usual, but the vegetable part was awfully horrible. Seems like they put all the vegetable bottoms in there (the part that they probably should have thrown out) and it tasted really odd. Even the waitress felt that oddity when she was serving the food and started explaining that the cooks told her that it's a kind of alleged bok choy, but she couldn't finish her sentence (showing that she didn't know what she was talking about - probably because she wasn't explained by the cooks properly that wth was that). She was like: ""the cook said it's kind of bok choy, but umm... I don't know... um...""  I usually don't send back servings to the kitchen (maybe because I'm a bit shy when it comes to that), so I just accepted it and tried to finish my rice soup and chicken. Thinking back, maybe I should have really sent it back this time.  Realizing that cooks there treat their customers like an idiot and try to justify their poorly made food with not even a proper explanation to what it was makes me not to go there anymore. It felt like they thought ""OK this guy probably wouldn't care/question what he's eating, so let's just put whatever in his dish and it'll be alright..."")  Not to mention every time I go there, my shirt gets smelly (that doesn't happen with other restaurants) which shows the bad restaurant set up and probably non-standard ingredients in their food... My friends admit that too.  I gave them two and not one star because their drink is good, but the mentality that I think was behind the last food really disappointed me."
"Above average in many ways, no big weaknesses.  This is a good play to go if you want hardware upgrades, they have a lot of parts and components for PCs that will help you out if you are working on your machine at home compared to a box store that usually only has the three most popular cord converters/PSUs."
"One of the best times i've had going out in Las Vegas!  Went for my birthday with a group of friends for Steve Aoki. Couldn't have asked for a better time thanks to Brian Pfeiffer in Las Vegas! Set us up right and hooked us up with the PERFECT table with a view of Aoki! If you have any nightlife needs he's your guy to go to, 773-459-8133 Friendly and helpful!"
"We were staying at the LVH and received a $25 coupon so we decided to give it a try.    The ambience was fine - quiet, subdued, looked and felt very old-school.  The bread, especially the cranberry walnut, was fresh and good. We ordered the $32.50 8 oz. petite filet - the quality was just ok, not the tenderest I have had and in fact had a slightly odd grainy texture that is unusual for this cut of meat - but at least mine was cooked to the right temperature (medium) and seasoned well.  My companion ordered hers well done and it came butterflied and a little dried out and overseasoned. The table shared a potato au gratin and mesquite grilled asparagus.  Both were solid and good, if uninventive, and generously portioned to share and decently priced at $8.95 per side.  The wine list was not very extensive, but they had a decent selection of under $60 bottles as well as under $15 by the glass.  The service was also decent, if a bit aloof and pedestrian.  Mention of the dried out and overseasoned steak yielded no sympathy or response from the server, nor did it result in any discount or comp from the final bill.  Overall it was an ok experience, but with so many other awesome steakhouses now populating Vegas, I doubt that I will go back."
"I usually hate buffets, but this was definitely not your regular buffet!  The wait is pretty long, so if you're planning to have dinner at a certain time, I'd recommend going an hour earlier, as you will probably be in line waiting for about an hour. My friends and I went around 2pm and waited about 40 minutes. I guess the wait isn't too bad if you're with the company of friends, but if you're hungry... it can be the longest wait ever.   It was pretty nice inside. I loved the display of all the foods, especially the dessert. They had a special center section devoted to desserts. They were all presented so well that I wanted to try everything! However, I definitely recommend the crème brûlée and panna cotta.  They had a good variety of foods that satisfied myself, a meat lover, as well as my vegetarian friends. The pasta with truffle oil was one of my favorite dishes there. The ribs were pretty good, too.   Personally, I liked the fact that they didn't have a drink fountain and ordered drinks from the waiter/waitress. If we're paying so much, we as might as well get some service right? Haha.  Definitely coming back here!"
"Nice patio, decent food. Met a few friends here for drinks and dinner. I ordered campari and soda which is a tough one to screw up. The salad with shrimp, cotija, and a citrus dressing on the side was also good. The air was a bit cool for my Arizona blood, so the waiter kindly brought us over a heat lamp.   Overall- not a place for super foodies or cocktail geeks, but a nice place to hang with a group when the weather is nice."
"Drinks are very good and the crab cakes. Everything else was so so.   PROS: Ambiance, service, drinks, crab cakes CONS: pricey, food is average"
"Hmmm, I'm really not a nightclub type of girl, but I was drawn to this place because I'm in Vegas looking for fun and this place is at MGM, where I'm staying so I thought it was a good idea to come here.......  First off there were three lines for this place and the bouncers/security or whoever they are were very rude..... Those first two lines were pointless!   Once we were inside it was over-crowded, despite the fact that there are several levels. They pack so many people in this place it's actually a safety hazard, it's very difficult to navigate through and explore the different levels at this place. There are too many stairs, if I had been tipsy or slightly drunk I could've easy broke an ankle. There is an elevator there but it's like waiting in line all over again. The dance floor was SUPER PACKED. I've heard some horror stories about the dance floor being a place where people get their stuff stolen...Steve Aoki was the guest DJ however I never got the chance to see him because the dance floor was so packed, I had to stand in the back. I would recommend getting bottle service just because the price of the drinks were very expensive, but it's Vegas what did I expect!!   I can't say this place is all bad. The music and surround system was nice, not too loud that you couldn't have a conversation. The lasers were really cool, I was kind of amazed lol. Everyone there was dressed really nice, including myself lol,  it's a really classy place. Next time in Vegas I will try this place again, at least I will know what to expect!"
"Ok! So the music was great!!! Had fun dancing the whole night, but unless you plan on getting bottle service then you won't be able to see the stage. Drinks are very expensive."
Went to brunch with girlfriends. The food was delicious although very heavy on the breakfast side of brunch. I would've liked go see it more even. I say the M wins best Brunch. The staff was very friendly. I would like to go back for dinner and see how it measures up.
"Why are there so many stairs?  Other than that, this place is chill.  If you roll with a bunch of girls, they usually comp you a table but only after you send them individual pictures of each girl.   My friends and I came a couple weeks ago and got a table behind the dj and a couple free bottles.    We had a pretty good time but geez those stairs will kill you."
"We were in line from 11 to 11 45 pm. We had prepaid our tickets online.  Main DJ ( Dada Life)  Be prepared to go up steep steps 4 floors up. They make you use the stairs to enter the club not the elevator! Bouncers are rude, you don't feel welcome, dance floor is small. Dada Life started to play at 3 am and they were very bad + they had 3 technical difficulties. Come on... Btw Dada Life's podcast is better than their life performance. The DJ prior to Dada Life played better tracks and mash up than Dada Life. 10 minutes 3 Gogo dancers that's  all you will see .    Drinks were 20% higher than other clubs. Drais Dance Club is so much better bigger layout in and out doors option ( roof top ) drinks cost less and bouncer are friendly.  Drais Dance Club had many times different go go dancers with different outfits.   Go to Drais dont waste your money   Cheers"
"I really hoped that despite the fact that I'd read so many mixed reviews about this place that it would be good just because, well; it's the Wynn.   The food was pretty uninspiring on our visit today. There seemed to be a disproportionate offering of starches meant to fill you up (lots of pastas, etc) and pretty bland seafood. The presentation was decent, but nearly everything looked better than it tasted. The crab legs were decent, the beef undercooked, the pork overcooked. The deserts were the prime example of presentation but no substance.   The service was terrible. We had to ask three times for water and had to give our drink order twice. When we ordered their sangria, the waiter said to us ""you know that costs extra, right?"", which I found sort of insulting, particularly since we'd order it from their drink menu with clearly stated prices next to it. We didn't see any of the wait staff again until they dropped the bill for the drinks (though they did keep the table cleared).  The awkward waiter commented to my girlfriend ""on to desert already"" and we spent the rest of the meal trying to understand what that meant.   Perhaps it was an off day, or due to the fact that we came very early (late lunch/early dinner) but I expected more of the Wynn. We'd skipped it the last time we tried to eat here because of the line and I'm glad we did, because it wouldn't have been worth the wait. In the end, we decided that there are too many other buffets to try and we've already visited far better, so we won't be back."
"Inside (non-patio) review: it was ok. Server was attentive...but not. Like checked on us a lot but didn't actually pay attention to us or what we said. For example, I asked for my sandwich WITHOUT chipotle mayo-it came with it, didn't keep water filled, and then refilled my ginger ale with water, brought the wrong check... Overall it was nice, my table just wasn't of priority. Not super expensive, but I do work for my money, and will spend it more wisely next time I go out."
"First time ordering.  Called in our order and it was ready as promised.  One of the BEST take out pizzas ever!!  Ordered Barros Specialty and it was loaded, I mean loaded with toppings and soooo cheesy!!  I saved the best for last, the crust.  Crisp and not soggy.  That is usually a make or break for us.  Perfection!  We'll be back....."
"Waited 20 mins before our order was taken. Then another hour+ for our food to arrive. They took and processed orders for take out before ours and kept pushing back our orders. When I followed up with the waitress, she gave me attitude as if I should understand that they were busy. Waiting over an hour for eggs and bacon is not worth it. Food was plain and nothing special"
We ordered pizza and grinders for delivery. The pizza is thin crust and delicious! The meatball grinder was fantastic! I will definitely order from them again!
This place is a rip off.  Larry laid to us. Said we could use Disneyland. But not true.  Now they will not talk to us about a refund.  Do not go there
"This is my go to place for a quick light meal whenever I'm in the area. Came here last night after watching a show across the street at the lower Ossington theatre. I always order the rare beef pho and avocado milk shake. The pho was definitely one of the best ive had in Toronto, the brooth was clean and flavorful and the beef thin and tender. The avocado milk shake was a good complement also made properly smooth and creamy as it should be! One major downfall of the restaurant was the bad service and almost too efficiency service making me feel rushed and unwelcome (hence I only give 3 stars).  Love: clean and flavorful brooth, good portion size  Hate: bad service, loud atmosphere"
"My first appointment with Daisy A. was amazing! She was ready for me as soon as I came into the salon so hardly any waiting. She was very kind & friendly. She asked what I was looking to do & told her what my ""game plan"" for my hair would be since I ultimately would like to lighten. I hate having short hair but Daisy calmed my hate by showing me quick ways I can style it, which was super helpful. She also took a few minutes to review what I ultimately want & agreed on a plan. It's been a week & I actually have grown to like my hair as a lob (long bob) especially with the way Daisy layered & angled the cut. My only complaint was the sign. It's small and I ended up missing the salon. Best way to remember is its in the Papa John's strip. Other than that, love this salon!"
"Really nice place. Enjoyed our lunch outside on the lower patio. Crab and avocado salad with lime and caper vinaigrette. Our server, Ben was very attentive.   Would love to try the upstairs cafe next time."
My favorite buffet on the Strip in Vegas.  I like this one more then Bellagio's. There is a very good variety and best time to go is a weekday afternoon for lunch for the best pricing.  Includes non alcholic beverages too.  The dessert bar is incredable.  Not recommended for kids since it's very expensive for them.
"First try at finding a good RMT in Toronto and VOS did the trick. Great massage technique, attentive RMT...exactly what I needed after a busy season at work and my recent move here (couches never equate to a good back).   Not sure if tipping your RMT is a common practice in Toronto as this never occurred to me in Vancouver, but I left a tip because I was asked and I was happy with the service. Perhaps I'll give other RMT clinics a try but if they're sub-par, I shall be back to VOS for regular and as-needed maintenance and tune-ups."
"Best customer service I've never had. I called Wells Fargo customer service phone line several times, but they couldn't give me the right answer what I really needed. I was so desperated. However, a banker ""Nick"" helped me patiently and I could leave this branch with a smile. Thanks Nick! I have been a Wells Fargo bank customer since 2006, and will always trust Wells Fargo and will be their a loyal customer. :)"
"I've had pho here a few times, it's mediocre. They have gotten orders wrong so many times. This is the last time I will be coming here because they have terrible service and they served me a water downed version of the passion fruit juice. This was the only reason to come, it wasn't even filled to the top anymore. The lady in charge is rude and clearly doesn't care for recurring business. Don't waste your time on terrible service. As soon as we sat down she got mad because we told her we would only be needing drinks. She got our order wrong, didn't fix her mistake. And my passion fruit juice was watered down!!!!! I'm done with this place."
Came here especially for the prime rib. thumbs up! Left happy because that was what we came here for. All other foods looks really nice but it was not good at all. Dessert selection was small and was not good. Texture and taste were off.  I suggest they take away their Asian selection because it was not Asian to me at all. Sushi looked really nice but I was already able to tell that it didn't taste good before eating it.
"Great place to live, location cannot be beat for a student, right across from ASU, pool is awesome, they have free food events, & the rent is very reasonable for the area.  Overall good place."
This is a good option from the other places at the airport. I was attracted to this place because it seemed really healthy and fresh. I got the chicken teriyaki with udon. It was ok. I did not expect it to be as sweet as it was. There were too many pineapples which I didn't expect at all. The noodles were fine and the chicken was ok. It was a bit bland but satisfactory. It definitely tasted healthy. It's fairly priced comparatively. You can get your food in less than 10 minutes which is great if you are in a rush.
"Buyers beware, they have no return policies, and quick to sell you something without informing you of that.  I purchased a tank for my e cigarette, which was missing an o-ring, the manager asked me to come back up there so they could help me. When I get there, the woman behind the counter called ""Jason"" who is supposedly in charge of these type of matters. Jason proceeded to inform her that there will not be a swap out of product, and to tell me I couldn't even find the o ring I needed at lowes,home depot, or any other hardware store for that matter, and they let me walk out an unhappy customer.  I got news for that idiot ""Jason"" I just left Home Depot, and .77 cent later I have a whole pack of o-rings that work perfect for the application.  Needless to say, this merchant lost my business before they ever had it."
"yet another californian who reviews vegas =)  have been going to wynn buffet for quite some time and have been going to bellagio buffet before this one and... this one takes the cake.   the line is normally 1hr+ wait but once you get there, you're extra hungry and it's worth it. i love the sections where you can customize your own pasta, congee, noodles, etc.   the prime rib is too bloody for me but sometimes they'll have things like kobe beef, they usually have duck, lamb, etc.   shrimp + crab are always good although the quality of the crab varies from time to time. there's usually always a line for seafood. who'd think that you go to the dessert for seafood haha  servers are usually pretty decent considering the amount of people they have to care for, haven't had too many problems despite the few times when i had to go without diet coke for 10 minutes. you just have to be aggressive and know how to flag them down (because they for sure will not come to you asking if things are ok)  desserts are mostly okay.. i always get a bunch just to sample them and see what's good and always with coffee. they have ice cream, cake, mousse, pie, etc. some are ok, some are AMAZING. ahhhh overload.   the wait time is really the only thing you can complain about here... well, and your expanding waistline."
"Those ""free entry"" lines will make you think twice about paying. You're looking at close to 2 hours...but overall it's not that bad. Main Floor was decent sized. Saw The Chainsmokers which I've been wanting to see for awhile. Show was mediocre and wasn't too packed. You can wander around and everyone seemed really nice. Overall my experience was good."
"One of the reasons I'm writing this review was from information I had read about the fair and reasonable prices at this store. That brought to my attention there probably were  others, such as myself at one time, unaware of the price differences that exist.    More to the point I used to shop at this store and one of there other stores quite often since I lived close by.  However as stated in other reviews I too purchased merchandise that stopped working or broke shortly after arriving home only to discover they had no return/ exchange policy. This happened on more than one occasion.    The most important reason I nolonger shop there was from something i was unaware of until brought to my attention by others. I was informed that most all smoke shops closer to and in phoenix were allot lower in price on merchandise which was the same or similar to as carried by Smoke Away. I was given a few names and locations of several of these businesses only a few miles east towards Phoenix.  When I visited these stores I was totally blown away at what I saw. To be truthful I figured I'd find a few items cents cheaper similar to stores caring items of a different nature competing with other stores that sell to the same type shopper. What I discovered was that the prices these stores had on all their items identical if not similar in type carried by Smoke Away were priced bucks cheaper.  Many of these stores had a much larger selection. In addition, they all had the typical fair return/exchange policy as most stores have.    Since this is my review I should mention that a few times I was treated poorly by a couple of employees there. However,  In all fairness I must further clarify that most of the employees there were very knowledgeable and treated me professionally. Another good point was the store was always clean and kept in good condition. The display cases were clean and clear allowing for good view of the merchandise. Everything taken into consideration for me its well worth a few more miles to drive for the much lower prices. If you don't feel the same then I strongly suggest that you at least go to a few of these stores and check out the prices and have your eyes pop out like mine did.   Lastly this whole situation with the lower prices found in stores located in the phoenix and surrounding areas in comparison to stores in Surprise and Sun City is also true for various other stores of different type products as well.  Not all knowledgeable of all the operating procedures in retail that affect merchandise pricing I remain confused as to the reason. I know a few things such as overhead, advertising, suppliers and the amount you by from them,  pilfering and in house losses,  all affect the price of the merchandise.  In the situation with the Smoke shops I would think everything is fairly closer except for leasing and different city tax codes. Without knowing the exact differences in the cost amounts i remain confused as to why such big differences In pricing among the stores exist? More than likely there probably is a reason clear only to the bean counters who deal with that on a daily basis."
Nicolette is amazing! I was a first time customer and Nicolette was wonderful and friendly. I asked her for a drastic haircut and she gave me exactly what I asked for. I will definitely be a repeat customer.
Myself and 25 coworkers had a amazing time there on Sunday night this club has set the bar for other Clubs. Huge thanks to Brian Pfeiffer 773-459-8133 a VIP Host for Hakkasan Las contact him for all your VIP needs best in the business. We had the best table in the house.
"Pros: +Outstanding dessert bar (has like 20 delicious items) +Decent selection +Vegan friendly food available +Friendly service  Cons: -Not much for vegetarians -I expected more selection (eg: Italian pastas were missing, poor fruit selection) given the price (over 30 bucks a person for lunch)  Overall: Good buffet but overpriced."
"These restaurants are always very nicely done... decor and construction is amazing, so you get the comfy, island feel while dining there.  The coconut shrimp is OK, but you really need to like coconut to enjoy it.   The macadamia crusted snapper was tasty, but the crust seemed a little too over-cooked, some was charred from the sautéing process.  The Thai Scallops and Shrimp were REALLY tasty, but slightly cool, rather than being as fresh and hot as it should've been.  Their piña colada cake was tasty!  The key lime pie wasn't so tasty, it tasted heavy raw egg custard.   The do have a very nice wine menu though, with many selections, at decent prices.  Service was got was nice.  Our server was friendly and smiled and was attentive."
"This nightclub is way over hyped. I just keep going back because they have the best DJs perform (Tiesto, Calvin Harris, etc). The club itself is way too small. By midnight on a weekend, you will not be able to move at all."
Amazing staff. We Almere so close to Calvin Harris. Such a great time!!! Love all the people working there
"Sadly this trendy joint is crowding next to our most loved Cibo. The drinks and food aren't very good, neither is the DJ. The design is wonderful, making use of an old Phoenix residence and patio. The servers take themselves too seriously, and the yuppies often drink too much. Sports TVs over the bar throws off the trendy -chic of this place."
"Lots of washing machines that were ""out of service"".  This place is okay and gets the job done.  I had trouble with the change machine as it was really sensitive in how you insert dollar bills into it."
"I will stop by for a drink here if I'm meeting my partner after work and sit at the bar. Nothing special. Order drink. Get drink. Pay for drink. No interaction with bartender. It's ok though, service is always fast. Never tried the food. Never even looked at the menu. 3 stars because for my need, this place was just ok."
"This is an awesome gas station/truck stop. Once I had a flat tire and was able to call upon them for roadside assistance which was super friendly. The fact do they have Arby's connected to them, two thumbs up. This truckstop always has friendly staff and they keep it very clean which I can definitely appreciate."
"Well, what can I say, I have been eating at Barros for a long time now and this location is probably my favorite. It became a weekly Thursday tradition for my family to come here - they could take my order before I even spoke it.  The pizza is very good. Honestly, there is not anything that overwhelmingly special about it. It's just a great tasting and simple pie. And the consistency is exactly the same each visit.  Unfortunately, it's been a little while since my last visit, but the service was absolutely top-notch considering it's a pizza joint and they simply bring your order to your table when ready. And considering the staff was very young overall, they still managed to come around and ask us how the food was and how we were doing, but it wasn't forced, it seemed very genuine.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back... tomorrow methinks!"
"I went here twice only because it resided in the hotel that we were staying and that it was convenient.  We came here with a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party.  We were on the VIP party list and when you approach this line, it is ridiculous.  There is no organization whatsoever to talk to the host.  It's really depends whether you can squeeze through the crowd or not to talk to the host.  I can see how a lot of arguments could occur in this situation.  After waiting for 30 minutes, our club promoter came to get us.  We enter an elevator to get to the club.  The ambiance and decor is really nice here.  The main dance floor gets really crowded.  If there was more room, i think we would have had a lot of fun.  I loved that they had the confetti drop.  It felt like new years for a minute.  There was also dollar bills flying down towards me.  I don't know if this is a normal thing for this club or we had some ballin' celebrity that decided to throw dollar bills into the crowd.  It was pretty fun trying to get the dollas! We came away with a whopping $5 that went towards the tip of our drinks lol.  Most of the music played on the this dancefloor is EDM.    This place has alot of stairs so make sure you wear somewhat comfy shoes girls!. Their hip hop room though on the other hand is pretty cool.  I just only wished it was bigger.  It's super crowded down there on the dance floor.  I only wished we had some room to dance.  We ended up dancing on a box but to be drunk and dance up there that long, it's kind of scary.   Overall, wish there was more hip hop music in vegas instead of this edm invasion but oh well, what can you do? It's fun with the right company!"
Always a friendly place with great food and drink. A bit expensive for my personal tastes but a great place for business.  Will be back the next time I am up in Scottsdale!
"I came here tonight to meet a friend for a drink.  We haven't seen each other in awhile, and I have to say that this place was a great place to meet somebody and just talk.    Of course we ended up getting an appetizer (the quesadilla...which we asked for without goat cheese.  I never had asparagus in my quesadilla before, but I have to say that it was really good!) and we got iced tea to drink.  If there was something that impressed me was how many times the waiter came by to refill our drinks...without ASKING!  I never knew they did that anymore....  I loved the atmosphere of this place.  The staff was very friendly.  What I really liked was that I didn't feel like I was sitting on top of anybody.  Everything was laid out nicely and spaciously.  The only thing that was negative was the prices...they were a little outrageous.  But I never really complain if I get great food and great service."
The maintenance staff is really helpful and quick to fix any problems you may have. So far I have had no problems despite the time maintenance came for my ac but they fixed it the same day and where there within ten minutes of reporting the issue!   so don't get swayed by the bad reviews people give. It is a nice quite place to live and very close to campus.
Had breakfast. Was not at all impressed. Eggs were watery and there really wasn't much variety. Think there was more variety in desserts than actual food for breakfast. We were arrived at 1015 so we also were able to see some lunch stuff being brought out towards the end- not really impressed again and I am pretty easy to please. Was going to consider coming back here for dinner based the on good reviews on here but after this breakfast we decided to pass.
"3.5 to be exact. If you are looking for a buffet, this is for sure the best one on the strip. BUT, being a buffet, the quality of the food is rather low. There is a huge array of food to choose from, but I didn't find much of it appetizing. The service is slow. The price is high. The entrance is very nice, but once you get inside, it really is not so exciting. The line is long. Not my first choice of dining in Vegas."
The service here just was not good. It seemed like the waitress forgot about us.  Then the food just wasn't good. Blackened fish sandwich was hard and the salad just could not get it right.
"This review is for Andrea Paxman. Andrea has been doing my hair for years, as well as my now adult daughters. She does such a great job! She never double books (I hate it when a stylist books another appointment for the time my color will be processing, it never fails to leave me sitting with wet hair waiting for them to finish!) She listens to what I want, and always offers fun new things to try. She is EXCELLENT with color, and I am posting a picture of my daughters hair that turned out AMAZING! Andrea only does hair on Friday's and Saturday's. In 5 years of having her do my hair (previously at another salon) she has never been late or had to cancel. Very professional and awesome!"
"Great ombiance!! In the country, so quiet and beautiful. Food good, although not too many options for a vegitarian. Will return with our dogs!!"
"They have a lot of good deals, their medium pizza is good for 2 or 3 ppl. They have a lot of classic cars as decor and mob posters.  Must try their BBQ chicken fingers, it isn't on the menu but if you ask they'll smother the chicken in their sweet bbq sauce. You get 5 big fingers plus fresh fries for only $9  The wings are good, not wow omg gotta have it all day every day but they are good :-) Service is great, cashiers always friendly. The only negative comment I would have is the wait time but their food is made fresh and worth the wait."
"I recently took 6 shirts into the Oxford cleaners at Riggs and McQueen and watched the counter person count my shirts and write down 6 on the pickup ticket.  When I picked them up a few days later there were only 5.  The person behind the counter said that their must have been a miscount when I brought them in and that there had to have only been  5 to begin with.  After a few minutes to get over my shock and disbelief at what she said I told her I had the pickup ticket which said 6.  She again said that there must have been a miscount and that they ""don't lose shirts"".  Unbelievably the store copy of the pickup ticket had the 6 crossed out and 5 written in its place.  When I pointed that out she repeated her miscount line and that they ""don't lose shirts"".  I left and told her to have her manager call me the next day.  After waiting for a call which never came I called the manager.  She hadn't heard about my problem, no surprise, and after listening to my description of the shirt she said she had it at the store.  It had never been logged in.  So while they didn't lose my shirt, they certainly had no idea who it belonged to.  If the counter person had handled this more professionally, had said that she was sorry it was missing and would check into it, I would have waited, they would have found the shirt and all would have been well.  But because they chose to cover up their mistake and say I only brought in 5 shirts and because of the unprofessional responses by the counter person, I will be finding another dry cleaner.  I won't do business with a company that doesn't treat their customers ethically and with respect."
I love to go to resale stores thrift stores yard sales and all places where  I can find deals  and treasures. This is a cute store the staff is cool but the prices on used stuff here are outrageous. I seen a few used items that could be found at kohls and and Ross. These things were used but sold at full price. Wth! Don't get me wrong there are really good quality items here. I just will not go back. Lol I seen girls going crazy over used thong bikinis. Just saying.
"My honey and I came here for date night and it was good- hit the spot for our pizza cravings and the amount of food was good for the price.  We got a small (surprising, right?!) and a side of garlic Parmesan sticks. What I loved about the bread sticks is that they're twisted like ropes or braids and there are garlic and Parmesan pieces twisted and tucked inside the braid!  The small pizza was just enough for the both of us! We got half pepperoni and half King Arthur supreme. The King Arthur supreme was delicious as the veggies were nice and fresh and had a crisp bite to the bell peppers!  Staff were really nice and what I like about it is the food came out pretty quickly! All in all, if we are on this side of town again, we will pay a visit for our pizza cravings!"
"This is a TRAP!  The guy who sells  show tickets on the street  told us that he has all show tickets at half price. We believed him and followed him to his ""office"" in Jockey Club to get the tickets.  Then, he asked us our phone # and our income in order to get cheap tickets. We had to pay him the tickets at half price in CASH first, but could not receive any tickets yet. That was not over, he took us inside Jockey Club for the presentation. There we had to spend more than 2 hrs in their ""open house"" presentation from the start to the end to get  ""free gift"", and they tried different stategies to make you buy  their timeshare. Scam!"
I used Dignity Moving services today for my move. They had to do three stops. I had been renting two bedrooms for two months while I waited for the perfect place for my kids and I. So my BF stored my sectional at his place in Ahwatukee. They got my sectional loaded in about 10-15 min from the THIRD floor. Talk about fast!! Then the movers drove to my place in Chandler to load up my two rooms of stuff. Again it was done super fast! Then we went to the final destination in Mesa / Gilbert area to unload everything. They competed the entire job and 3 stops in about 2.5 hours. About 40 min was driving. So they are extremely fast and much better than movers I have used in the past. I highly recommend.
"Gurmpy, bad service. Trouble with follow-trough and delivery."
"My husband and kids came in last weekend, I loved the atmosphere.  I felt like I was on vacation (has an island feel) with the decor and sitting upstairs with the open balcony. My husband has the filet and it was amazing! Melted in our mouths, I had a cheeseburger which is great as well. I gave it a 4 star just for service our waiter was kind of slow it took 10-15 to take just our drink order. But also he was the only waiter for about 8 tables."
"The food was great, though I question if the mushroom appetizer was frozen not homemade, but the rest of the food was fresh and well prepared and presented.  The service was awful.  It was slow, and no one could decide who was going to take our order.  Once the order was in, it took 45 minutes for our food to be delivered.  I would rank it higher, but until they fix their service they are going to have issues."
"This ranks down there with the worst. I threw in the extra star because the young lady there was very nice. She followed us around and claimed everything was her favorite thing, but overall, I get that she is trying to make a sale.  We were full from lunch and another bakery earlier that day, but as we all know, I have to stop when I see places I haven't tried.  We ordered a lemon bar/pastry thing and a chocolate cookie of sorts. It was the thickest cookie I have ever seen so the massive price tag was a bit more tolerable. That was before I went to bite it and it was so hard that I thought I would break a tooth off! Yowza. The lemon bar was average but again, it seems like the prices here are pretty high. A slice of cake was $8.95. You can get a slice of motherload cake at Claim Jumper for $10.99 and that thing is three times the size and probably tastes three time better.  I won't be back. After Drago Sisters earlier, I can get way yummier goodies at half the price. Another sad face."
The community is well gated with furnished apartments and greenery all over. The pools are neat and clean. The best part is the monthly events where they provide snacks and treats for the residents.
Horrible.... I should have checked Yelp prior to going....What a let down... Everything was a replica and some of the items had nothing to do with JFK.  It looked amateur...What a horrible exhibit for our 35th President....  The best thing about going was I purchased an Air Force One cap for my dad for his upcoming birthday....
"I'm going to make this as short as possible because I can seriously keep talking about this place for days. This is the BEST find yet. My boyfriend and I were roaming around several weeks ago at Kierland Commons looking for a place for dinner. After browsing through all the restaurants, we decided Tommy Bahama, just because the atmosphere outside seemed great and romantic.   They have this Dining After Dark after 8 pm until August 31..so today..so if you read this today hurry up and grab someone to go!! It's $50 for a couple, and you get 2 super yummy Mai Tais with a real flower on top, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert. The menu for this is very limited, but everything we had on there was heaven.   We went here again last night and I really have to yelp this place because they deserve it. Last time we sat on the first floor listening to the music, this time upstairs sitting by the window looking out. Also, I was wearing a black dress and our hostess came back and gave me a black napkin instead of the white ones on the table. What? Wow, I was so impressed. If I dine in Scottsdale too often, I would be way too spoiled.   Anyways, to the food. We got the goat cheese appetizer again and it is OMG SO GOOD. There's macadamia nuts, mango salsa, soft and fluffy goat cheese, and I just want some more now!!!  We've tried all 3 entrees, and I would say the Snapper is the best. Their almond rice is delicious!! Although my boyfriend says he can't taste the difference between regular rice..  Then of course pina colada cake for dessert. We were so full by then that we had to take the cake home. Had it for breakfast this morning and it is still oh so soft and moist :)   Oh and by the way, their warm bread is SO warm and soft too :) The service has been great the past two times, and I would go back even without the dining after dark deal!"
"I go here every vegas trip on the last day.  I usually bring newbies in tow.  And thus I bring them here, confident they will end their trip on a positive note.  This place has not let me down once.  Every single person I bring here raves about the food and the meal is one of the highlights they speak of for weeks after the trip.  And definitely do the late lunch/stay for dinner trick.  You'll want to stay here a few hours anyway."
"Oh my goodness! I had to drop down stars just in one day! Yesterday, for Halloween, finding a spot to dance, drink, and and actually seeing the DJ (Hardwell) was so perfect.   HOWEVER!! My friends and I almost got kicked out because the security thought we were smoking weed!! ARE YOU SERIOUS???? WE DON'T SMOKE IN GENERAL! No weed, no cigarettes, no vape, no hookah. Picked the wrong group of people for that.  The security stepped up and said ""you guys gotta go"" we simply asked why, and he said ""you guys are smoking weed"" LMFAO we argued for a good 5 minutes. We were about to get kicked out FOR NO REASON! We were livid, it seriously killed our mood. My boyfriend told him to smell his breath and he finally said ""you're good"" but still continues to harass my friend telling him that he's the one smoking weed because he smells it. My friend hasn't even touched weed in his LIFE! All because he was dancing and moving his hands around so the security thought he was passing ""weed"" around.   It was so ridiculous, after arguing back and forth, he finally left us alone but still made a smart remark saying ""I'll be watching you guys"" how would you feel if you got blamed for something you didn't do then have the feeling of someone watching you all night??  Halloween could have been perfect but there will always be flaws about the club all the way to wet republic. MGM really needs hire better security. Rated 1 star for each. Sad  Hakkasan makes so much money, sometimes even sell out tickets but still cannot manage to give out free water.. $10 for a small Fiji water btw"
"This time share is a joke, filthy deceiving sales staff shows the true color of greed and dishonesty.  Do not be tricked and thinking the so called gifts for sitting through their time share are actually worth anything, you have to purchase drinks for the comedy show tickets(those tickets are found on the streets to pass out), restaurant certificates through restaurants.com is not worth anything where you must payout of your pocket, free 3 nights hotel stay is a mail in requires you to pay a deposit, casino play money is a bogus.   Worst of all, rude sales staff don't take a no for answer, be prepared to fight your way out of there with exhaustion.  Stay away !!"
I came there with a groupon and I was disappointed with a lot of bad reviews I saw online. I went there on a Saturday and it was very quiet which let me and my boyfriend being able to discuss. The atmosphere was nice and romantic. Food could have been better but the prices are cheap. The waitress was nice. I would go back there.
"I have shopped here on several occasions, and the merchandise is on the high end if a little highly priced. Nice jewelry section as someone mentioned.  I am writing my review based on bringing in items.  The first time I brought in some clothes, they accepted about 8-10 items.  Checked back in eight months and they had no record of anything they had taken in. They had my information, but no clothes. I found it hard to believe that nothing had sold, and that they had no record of it.  As it is more convenient than My Sister's Closet, I gave them one more try. This time I asked them to give me an itemized list for my records which they did with little grace. Checked back a few months later for them to tell me nothing had sold, and it had been donated.    I'm done.  For value and professionalism, stick with My Sister's Closet.  I won't be back here again."
"Called for a price to replace an engine and transmission mount on my Honda Civic.  They quoted a price much lower than the dealership.  I told them exactly what was going on and what was needed before they gave me a price.  I made an appt to take it in.  I took the car in and, after 45 min, they told me that now that they had the VIN # they knew that a different mount was needed that would cost $200 more and that they couldn't get for 5 days.  I drove an hour to get there.  Why didn't they ask for the VIN # before they gave me a price and made an appt?  Needless to say, I'm not a happy camper.  And I'm pretty sure my other car was side swiped while sitting in their crowded parking lot."
"$62 for two drinks.  Seems pretty high, even for Vegas! I went with my girlfriend to the main floor and we were harassed by 5 different groups of guys. This is a very trashy club and although we were trying to have a good time, the atmosphere ruined it for us."
"My husband and I love this place.  Dustin always makes his sales floor inviting with displays working in different finds and eras to ""show"" people how they can reuse and give life back to a piece that maybe seems out of sorts alone. He and his team always are ready to assist or answer questions - whether it be about the origin of a piece or ideas of how to up cycle it.   Prices are reasonable on most items - sometimes a little higher than elsewhere BUT his items are always in pristine condition - so I expect and am happy to pay a little more.  The bargain room is a place we generally do a quick walk thru in but haven't been lucky there as of late.  Always worth a quick stop!"
"Decent bar food. Nice patio (with feral cats)& outdoor games.  service is ok. Parking at times is precarious & difficult altho free. Entry is awkward depending on where u enter from. It's great place when weather is nice, Summer too hot for outdoors."
"My boyfriend and I eat (too much pizza) here at least once a week. Their lunch deals are just unbeatable. Huge amounts of great food for very little money. Personally, I think this location has the best pizza, since the taste does vary a bit from location to location."
"Mr. Mercado, I kindly appreciate your feedback. The beer that took so long was the first.  The question about temperature that I had is because I don't understand why the rice didn't come out warm nor hot. The salsa that was brought out initially was not good, our server brought out a salsa level 5 which then... I said tasted like my moms.   I did take the albondiga soup home and it was not good at all.  The A grade was not visible Sir but I will not question you as the information is online on SNHD.  Another thing is that I nor my family drink ice tea nor water that sits on a server station because of our industry. So why would my husband want to drink ""Diluted"" mountain dew. That is where the comment came from.  I know Mexican food as my father is from Durango and my mother is from Chihuahua. I accept that nothing will be like home cooking but please don't make it sound like this is authentic.  I wish as a business owner you would consider taking constructive criticism and better the issues that your patrons make instead of defending yourself."
"This place is just ok, nothing spectacular. It's the kind of place you go to when everything is else is closed or when youre starving.  Here is my rating factor, on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best)  Food - 8 Atmosphere - 8 Selection - 8 Service - 8 Cleanliness - 8 Overall - 8"
"Came here with a colleague.  Soup was thin and salty, not enough noodles.  So disappointing.  Waste of time.  Waste of money.  Without a doubt the worst pho I have ever had."
Always good food. Love their thin crust pizza. Reminds of me of back home in Connecticut.  We go often for both take out and eat in.
"I needed my hair done, I didn't feel like doing it, ever have one of those days? It was the Friday before Thanksgiving weekend and it was late in the afternoon, I knew my chances in finding someone to do my do where little to none.  I whipped out my handy Yelp app, told it what I was looking for and what area I was in, and it found Sassy Chic Salon,  so I called over and spoke to Andrea, who said yep, if you come in at 7:30pm someone can do your hair!  When I showed up in the shop I knew it was fate that brought me there. This was the shop I have been looking for. I love it!!  Its Paris baby!!   I was a few minutes early, so I had to wait, and then Andrea showed up and said let's get started.  She is amazing! A girl full of talent, and I'm not just talking hair. Doing hair is a part time thing for her and she mostly works weekend nights, which is perfect for me, but she is crafty too.    The prices are completive, but not overly priced, she is fast, friendly and I am happy my Yelp App has led me to Sassy Chic Salon."
"Yes, I know this is corporate.  But it is pretty darn good and heaps of fun.  Especially if you are in the courtyard at night!  Food is yummy, deserts are terrific and huge.  Drinks are quite competent as well."
No exchange policy even tho they will sell you crap equipment. Don't waste your money here. The manager/owner is a real scammer
There is always that one drink that is so perfect that you want to savor it well I had that drink today at this Starbuck.  I had a black and white coffee mocha and it was made to perfection. It was hot blended together and the perfect amount of whip cream. So if you want your perfect drink then head to this Starbucks.
"It's definitely interesting the atmosphere here is very loud but always full.. So far the waitress has taken about 20 min to finally get our order.. The food is good, I get the Waffle Breakfast Sammich.  So the time it took for our food makes me drop a star. The food is good. The coffee is way to strong meaning too many scoops in the coffee. The service needs to be better for busy days."
"I mean, for airport food, it's freshmade and has some good choices.  I had the tuna sliders and they were fine (pricey at $12) but good.  Very greasy bread so ask for the bread dry unless you like that grease.  Fries were not good (edible but totally bland even with two packets of salt and ketchup.  The area of this food stand is lame overall so this is a good choice in that small area."
"I will keep it short and sweet without all the details of my horrible experience there for a friend's birthday. The food is mediocre at best, the service is for the most part friendly but incredibly slow, and even with a reservation it was a good two hours before we were served our meals. Save yourself the waste of money and head elsewhere."
"A decent place to dine-in. I went in with some office colleges for lunch. Plenty of seating, the server was very friendly, food came out in a a little slow but was hot! The server did apologized for the delay in food.   Pricing was friendly on the pocket. I ordered the Tom Xao Sot Tay Xi (Stir Fried Shrimp with Black Bean), which was quite tasty and the Bean sauce went well with the Shrimp and vegetables. The portion size was perfect and the dish had little kick to it which was nice.   Overall the food was good, restaurant & tables were clean . Parking is not a problem as its part of a plaza."
"I would like to give this place more stars as the food is really good but the service is lacking.  We were seated in the bar and waiting over 15 minutes for service.  We had to go see the hostess to get a server.  The bartender arrived and apologized for the delay and assured us we would be well taken care of.  We ordered our meals and though they did come out quickly, the variations we requested (i.e substitutions) were not made so the meal was not what we ordered.  Not wanted to complain, we ate what we were served.  As stated above, the food is very good (The Vigazz burger is delicious as well as the chicken sandwiches).  We will continue to dine there but if the service remains lackluster, we may may find other alternatives in the area."
"Choices Express leaves a little bit to be desired compared to the numerous other newsagents located around this area. What brings it down, ironically, is the lack of choice. The shop strikes me as being very empty. The shelves are sparsely populated.    A group of us visited here part way through a booze up to get some snacks and most of us came out with the same thing.  However, as mentioned before, you can indeed get some cheap booze here and the staff are always pleasant. Ideal as the kind of place where you need to grab some essentials in a hurry, but little to make it stand out from the countless other little shops that do exactly the same in this area."
"I recently stayed here and you can rest assured that any issues you have will be resolved quickly! The staff here is so responsive and helpful with anything you may need! I a more of a social person so I do not stay inside my apartment as much but I do prefer the location of my apartment. There are really good food options walking distance from the complex including Canes which is my favorite! If Scottsdale is your thing, it is pretty much a straight shot to Old Town! This isn't going to be your party apartment complex but the nice thing about that is you can always come home from partying knowing it's going to be quite! It also works in your favor if you're more studious than the average ASU student!"
"Food was good but uninspired.  Waiter was friendly but not polished.  Loud noises of clanging pots accidentally dropping in the kitchen plus the noise of food frying. Was not the most romantic nor sophisticated venue for the price, but fine for a business lunch or dinner."
"Great buffet and great service.  We never had an empty glass and the server was cheery and very polite.  Desserts were plenty but was so so.  They didn't have fresh bananas on hand for the crepes nor did they have nutella.  However, the pastry chef found a way to get me a fresh banana which was nice.  I went here for my bday dinner and I would have to say it was worth it.  Prime rib was good, cheeses and cuts of meat were decent.  i was mostly here for the king crab legs which I was craving badly and had to have some pronto.  Only disappointment was they didn't have king crab it was the smaller version.   Oh well its probably not in season but  I guess it sufficed beacuse it calmed my crusteacian cravings.  PRime rib was also good and they had fresh horseradish sauce.  Im glad we came here but I think I am still in love with Bacannal."
"Every time we come into town we stop by for Happy Hour. This place has great atmosphere and the food is delish. Today food and drink were no exception. I must say the girls at the hostess station were just ok. There were 2 of them, the dark haired gal was very nice. The blonde, not so much, I said thank you to her several times, no response back. We then just sat at the table for about 5-10 minutes w/no server stopping. This was starting to go down hill fast. Then a very friendly server stopped and asked if we had been helped. We replied no & she stopped what she was doing to take our drink order and introduce herself. This server single handedly changed the whole experience! Thank you Lauren, job well done! Your customer service and happy personality saved our dining experience!"
Great service and inexpensive. The quality is really there when you consider the price. Will come back.  Great service and inexpensive. The quality is really there when you consider the price. Will come back.
"Cash only, which they don't advertise till the moment they bring the bill. However they charge HST and in my case server wasn't friendly and didn't even pretend being grateful for extra tip. Slow service, cheap decor, food is ok but nothing special for the prices above average. Don't recommend!!!"
"AHHH I checked yelp for this immediately after walking in. Biggest joke by far. I wanted to take pictures to show how absurd the display and over all appearance of this place was, but didn't want to spend any extra time in there, trying to get a refund. It was sparse, everything was a duplicated version, apparently chairs from other presidents and other First Ladies dresses were in there. Nothing what I thought it would be. I would give a higher review for the supervisor that refunded me the 3 tickets I bought for locals, totaling $71. I would have been disappointed even if it was free. Oh well. Dallas here I come for the real deal."
SHAMIKA!!!! YAAAAS! Amazing color correction done right. Beautiful results and a client for life gained! Thank you for correcting my bad decision coloring from another salon. Go book with her...you will not be disappointed.
"I stopped by about 3am, they had a sign out front that says Made Fresh to Order, everything Pretzel, no time frame, just available now, come on in. I have submitted thus false advertising to Morgan & Morgan for a Class Action Suit, and if you were in the parking lot about that time, I have taken pictures of people entering and leaving the store as well as License Plates of cars in the parking lot as I couldn't take a picture of a clock and signed time from employees, so if you are contacted by an attorney from the morning of 7/1 don't be surprised"
"Just happened by this place last night. We had a large party including children and were staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas. This pizzeria was perfect. We enjoyed the spaghetti, a variety of pizzas, and fried zucchini. Everything was delicious. Highlights were the zucchini, garlic bread, and bacon and pepperoni pizza. Service was fantastic, and the New York themed decor was fun and interesting. A very casual, family restaurant feel. We will definitely be back."
"We want to go back to vegas just so we can eat here!!! We ate at all the Vegas hotels but this one the food was displayed beautifully and taste just as good! the place is breath taking!!, gorgeous floral displays and the price was ok, well worth it! they make whatever pancakes you want in front of you, I had red velvet pancakes and it was amazing, the little cake buffet was so tasty! I took everything because I couldn't choose. I kinda wanted to somehow put a bed in there and live because this place gave us life! It's a check in my book!"
"I went my second time as a more informed consumer after trying nearly all the buffets, and this is still my personal favourite. I am thoroughly impressed with Wynn's  Variety isn't huge, but it's enough. EVERYTHING looks rather appetizing, there was nothing at the Wynn buffet that i would have rather killed myself than to try.   A party of 4 arrived at 2.35pm and we got in after 30 minutes.   I made my way to get some cocktail shrimps which were big and succulent. A bite of smoked salmon, trout and anchovies, some greek salad, all above average for buffet standards.   Then some alaskan king crab legs. huge, meaty and cut for your convenience, all you gotta do is use a fork and pick the meat out. Relatively fresh and I seasoned it with a hint of warm butter.  The prime rib was more of a medium, which i prefer medium rare. It was alright, juicy and not too fatty. The lamb chop was not bad, also medium. I also got some mussels which was cooked well, not dry at all! As well as some asparagus which was very dry.   Dessert time, I got a crepe which is my favourite from all the vegas buffets. Beautifully presented with house made whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries. The creme brulee was freshly made, and the best creme brulee i've had in a buffet. The tiramisu was also pretty good, I finished everything. The strawberry champagne mousse was a little on the sour side and I only had 2 bites of it.  We sat by the garden and it was bright and pretty. Our server was much nicer and more prompt than any other vegas buffets I've recently visited, very courteous too.  ***  Tip: Come before 2.45pm to get in line, so you can eat dinner for the price of lunch. They switch over at 3.30pm. Cheap people style! $35 (lunch price incl tax) for dinner! Crab legs come out only during dinner  Favourites: King crab legs, (not snow!) Big and juicy cocktail shrimp. Higher quality ingredients and prepared with more care. Presentation is outstanding  Do not want: a little expensive. Long lines for king crab legs. medium cooked prime rib (but if you go before they cut to the middle, it's medium rare) and lamb chops   Last words: Definitely the best Vegas buffet in terms of quality, ingredients, presentation."
Great club! What it should be with a great sound system. Make sure you get a table i the theatre area as tehre is a hip hop room upstairs and also a back roomo where you can't see the performers.
"Like other reviewers, I too used a promo from Travelzoo.  Not only did I waste my money, but more importantly, I wasted a dinner in Vegas:-(  The good: - Great location - City Center is a lovely area to spend an evening - Restaurant has a nice decor - My 8oz petit Filet was quite yummy (though not as good as Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris) - Good pre-dinner pretzel bread  The Bad: - Waiter was totally rude. Barely looked at us and seemed pissed off. - The wait staff talked, interacted and seemed rude to each other right near the tables. Aren't wait staff supposed to be invisible?? - Our dinner came with champagne. It was served in PLASTIC flutes. - 4 items on the menu were sold out (it was only 8:30!!!) - The Beso salad (reg $14) was nothing more than about 9 leaves of lettuce and 4 cherry tomatoes (I'll post a pic) - Eva's famous guacamole was almost tasteless, with a hint of lemon.  - Our dinner came with dessert - lame chorros that were literally thrown on the table by a waiter walking by!  All in all, I would NOT recommend this place, especially with so many fabulous restaurants nearby."
"This place is definitely the kind of upscale ""casual"" dining spot that you'd expect it to be. It's a popular locale and definitely can get busy after five with people filing in after work. The food is good but it really depends on what you get. We got guac and chips with salsa for the table. It was flavorful and the salsa was delicious but since it is Phoenix, I've definitely had better at a lower price. The Prime Vig Dip was a pretty big disappointment for our table. The beef was over cooked and so chewy it was easier to just take out some of the meat so there would be less chewing. The Maple Glazed Salmon was pretty good, the cut of salmon was cooked well. I personally got the Lean and Green Steak Salad. The presentation for everything was beautiful. The steak salad I got was good, though it could have used more flavors. The balsamic glaze didn't add enough dimension and the cheeses didn't make a big impact. The steak was cooked very well and definitely held up the dish. The cocktails were reasonable though I've had better at a better price so I'd go somewhere else for drinks. All in all, It was good but I don't know if I would come back unless someone actually wanted to go."
I needed my FFA jacket dry cleaned. It's very sentimental to me and I didn't want just anyone to clean it. I took it to oxford cleaners and they did a great job! All of the spots from showing my animals came out and they didn't lose our damage any of my pins or medals. I would definitely go here again!
Love their chese pizza and wings and fingers alway good food and always great service good deals on specials
pretty bad. snooty waiters.  they try to put a fancy twist to the food but it doesnt work. the paella was way too bland. the mac n cheese was more like macaroni w a hint of cheese. very dry.  and the garlic mashed was way too salty.
Daniel and Lynn were my movers and displayed the utmost professionalism and quality work ethic. The previous movers I had had three movers and took 7 hours to do the total move. Daniel and Lynn took 3 hours and and charged $450 less. They were efficient and courteous and did an amazing job. I will use these guys again and will recommend them to everyone I know. Thank you!
"I didn't really want to try The Buffet because of the 3.5 stars.  I think that if they are charging around $40, it better have at least 4 stars.  There was a 40 minute wait at around 8:00 on a Sunday night.  We didn't want to wait so we chose to pay the extra $16.00 each to bypass the line.  Totally worth it, and you can choose a free sangria, mimosa or white wine spritzer.    Happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.  Almost everything I ate was good.  I say almost because, I didn't care for the lamb meatball or the fact that the crab legs were still a little frozen.    The Asian choices were pretty good.  They have some Dim Sum, Duck Buns and fried rice with Chinese sausage.  I enjoyed the sushi with the Japanese Takuan (radish)cucumber, and gobo.    I didn't try any of the carving station items but they did have Matzo Flour Fried Chicken(kind of like Brooklyn Bowl). It was really good.  I also enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder.  You don't see that clam chowder very often.    For dessert, I thought the Cracker Jack cake was delicious and the Green Tea  cupcake was pretty good too.  Overall a really good Buffet but just not as good as the one down the street in that palace...."
"I was underwhelmed by my experience at The Vig Fillmore. It might have been that we were seated inside instead of on the awesome patio. It might have been that the menu is one of the worst I have seen (Pad Thai and Burgers? Mexican food and Edamame?). It might be their apparent love affair with American cheese, or as I call it, plastic. (Why not use cheddar?) Sorry to say it, but based on their current menu, I most likely will not return. I wish them all the best and hope they create a better menu."
Great place for HH!! Our go to fave place to chill. Live music is always great and service is always excellent!
"The new young girl has absolutely zero customer service skills. Picked up my dry cleaning yesterday. She had ear buds in her ears and didn't give a crap about the business I gave them. No thank you no acknowledgement of my business no nothing. It was like pay me and get the ""F"" out of here!!! Her face would have broke if she even attempted a smile. Never going back!!!"
Manning Sprinkler Services did a complete re-do of my front & back sprinkler systems.  Wow!  These people are THE best!  Don't go anywhere else.
"I've always had just an ok time here. The food was good, took a while to get, and the staff was pleasant. The sliders and fries were tasty. I've never had an overwhelming feeling of delight after I left. I really want to like this place because it's really cute and I luv Vig Uptown, but it hasn't really wowed me yet. This won't deter me from trying this place again. I still would recommend trying it."
"Love this place!!!  They keep it clean and well organized, considering the amount of things they have.  You can always find great deals, and it doesn't break your bank.  Go on the weekend when the red barn is open as well.  That is where we got the majority of our things."
"Is it just me or has the quality of the buffet gone down?  I've been here when Wynn opened not too long ago and their food was top quality.  Their desserts were excellent and they provided a wide variety of foods to eat.  However, I visited here recently and felt that many of the foods there weren't as good as before.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed eating the snow crab legs, shrimp cocktail, etc. but for $40, you'd expect the quality to remain somewhat the same.  I also noticed that there weren't that many people eating here, even during prime dinner hours.  I waited only 20 minutes and the line didn't even come close to forming outside of the buffet.  I still like this buffet very much but next time, I may end up just going to Planet Hollywood or Bellagio instead."
"I hired a ""friend"" to redo my sprinkler system and it became like something out of Jurassic Park. I have known the Manning family over the years, but didn't think to call them before I hired the Bozo I did. They came and retrofitted the mess he made and since then, which is about four years ago, they are my ""go-to"" sprinkler people. They are the only sprinkler people I recommend. Family owned and wonderful people."
"$134 to replace 20 feet of flex tube in front yard. That fixed the leak, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  I've had a similar leak repaired before for half that cost by a landscaper."
"The bowl of salsa that came out had something strange in it (I was thinking a cilantro stem or something) so I fished it out. I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa. The waiter wasn't quite sure how to handle it and couldn't find a supervisor to help him out. With our stomachs turning from the thought of wire or other ""extras"" that may he included we decided it was time to go. I really wanted chips and salsa too."
"LOVE Katelyn!!! She is by far the best stylist I have ever been to. Not only is she a great sylist, but she is also such a nice person and pleasure to talk to. She did such a wonderful job fixing a bad dye job I had gotten from a stylist at a different salon. She took her time making sure she did everything possible to fix what had been done to my hair and fix the nasty orange color I had been given. She did what other sylist told me couldn't happen. I am so happy I found her, I will never go to ANYONE else again!!"
"I hate crowds and I don't often go to clubs. But the BF wanted to check out the ""hot new Vegas club"" so we got a table for our party of six. Despite my slight disdain for clubs, I enjoyed Hakkasan enough to give this place 4 stars.  Perks worth mentioning: - They treat you pretty well if you're willing to shell out the $3K for table service. - We didn't have to wait in line at all since we got table service. - Our table service included 4 bottles of liquor, 6 mixers, 6 red bulls, and 6 bottles of water. - There are hidden drawers underneath the seats at the table service areas so you can store purses, jackets, etc. - The hidden drawers contain phone chargers. - Staff was constantly checking our table for empty glasses to take away and wipe up any spills in our general area. - There was never EVER a line for the ladies room and it was always clean. - Tommy Trash was spinning and the music was pretty awesome! - The table service areas are pretty spacious and it never got too crowded. Lots of dancing room for us! - At some point of the night when the crowd was getting thinner, our party got transfered to a better table closer to the main dance floor. SCORE!  One strange gripe during the night was that one of the bouncers made me stop dancing with my BF who was sitting down. It wasn't like I was being inappropriate or lap dance-y or anything. So I'm not sure why he made me stop. Is my dancing THAT bad!?! Other than that bouncer guy, the rest of the staff was pretty nice and awesome to us. Very rare to find such friendly service at a club.  We partied until they kicked us out sometime close to 4am. Even though we didn't venture every floor of this multi-leveled club, we had a good time! Maybe it was good that we stuck to the one floor though...I heard that there are lots and lots of stairs. No thank you to that! I like to wear heels to clubs ;)"
"Came here on Sat June 10, 2017 for happy hour with a travel MeetUp, before attending the Kierland concert Chuck e Baby.  Seating was very crowded.  Nine of us sat upstairs.  Server did come and ask me what I wanted to drink in a timely fashion. I said glass of ice (water was already on the table) and lemon wedges and several packets of Sweet n Low (I always make my own lemonade).  I did not place any food order at that time.    Lemon and ice came about 15 min later, but not the Sweet n low.  I had to ask 3 times, 3 different people for the Sweet and Low.  Hey, I wanna drink my water!    My food order was the $7 pork belly sliders (2).  The pork was the size of a Pink Pearl eraser (remember those?) in each slider, with pickled veggies (like what you'd find in Vietnamese restaurant sandwich).  It was good, wish the pork belly piece was larger.  3.5 stars.    Having to ask 3 times, 3 different people for my Sweet and low, knocks the stars down, but what really makes me give 2 stars is the place is SO NOISY, YOU CAN'T TALK TO EVEN YOUR NEIGHBOR, SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.  Someone at our table commented that the walls and floors do not absorb sound.  Cos the person sitting directly across from me could not hear what i was saying, I had to stand up, lean over the table and then YELL AT HER!    So if you wanna get together with your friends to ""say something to them"", besides just eat, DO NOT COME HERE!  Maybe sitting outside is better, but I did not sit outside, too hot.    My bill was so slow in coming, everyone else got their bills and paid them already, so I had to go to the counter and ask for my bill.  Someone had to tell my server.  I shouldn't have given her a tip, but she was busy, she was not rude, so I gave her a tip.    Dinner entrees are expensive, so not coming back here.  The Living Room has more appealing happy hour food for less money - Good value!"
"This salon is great. I had my hair colored, cut and styled by Leeann and am very happy with the results. She was even able to fit in my daughter to get her hair done as well. I will definitely be back!"
"Really nice salon...attractive (think boutique), friendly, clean, with competitive prices.  The best part, though, is Kathy D.  This woman can cut, style, color, and I never walk out looking ""done.""  Kathy talks everything over with you first and then does exactly what we've agreed to.  And she's fun, too--witty, bright, and thoughtful."
Not your regular Genghis grill where you get to pick and choose your ingredients. They have a limited menu but still a good option compared to what you get in airports. The food is freshly made and served hot. Had the chicken teriyaki bowl which was well made. The portions were generous and I walked away happy.
"Love, love, love this place. I've been there several times over the years for lunch & dinner and have NEVER been dissatisfied. My favorite appetizer is the Tuna Poke-all 4 of us shared it and everyone loved it, the goat cheese app is also amazing.  Last night I had the special-Halibut on sun dried tomato risotto. I finished every morsel of this plentiful portion.  The atmosphere here is beautiful inside or out and the staff is always pleasant and happy.  I love happy staff, thanks Arnold.  If you like dessert you'll love this place. All of the choices are as tasty as they are beautiful. Their presentation on all their dishes is phenomenal,  compliments to the kitchen staff!"
"I've heard A LOT about the Chuck Box over the years, so I finally decided it was time I gave it a go.  Atmosphere-wise, nothing to write home about. It has a similar vibe to the Original Hamburger Works, with a wagon full of condiments and a similar order, watch them grill your burger, pay setup. The place looks old, which I guess is part of it's appeal. They only accept cash for payment, which is kind of lame in this day and age.  The burger itself was good. Good like a home-cooked burger on the grill would be. For $8 and some change, I'm not in a rush to hurry back here, but I won't say that I'll never return. Overall, I just didn't feel it lived up to the hype."
"Helpful, informative, and patient employees. Took over half an hour to explain everything I had questions on. I felt no pressure to open a new account with them which is much appreciated."
"THE WYNN... THE MOST GLAMOROUS OF THE GLAMOROUS HOTELS EVERYTHING IS THERE ENCORE, SURRENDER, ENCORE BEACH, XS why not the good food right?   $40 not well spent -_- RIO WORLD BUFFET ALL DAY EVERYDAY"
"I am actually shocked to find a good review of this store.  I have never felt more uncomfortable going anywhere.  Stopped in while my boyfriend was getting his oil changed as I heard great things about the store and actually have sent people to it!   I walked in and they asked me to set my drink down on the counter- I have absolutely no problem with that as I know it is not actually their merchandise and they need to protect their consignors pieces from not getting stained. But as I walked around I could see them watching me and my boyfriend said he was uncomfortable and would wait outside. He came back in to grab me since his oil change was done and the sales associate asked me, ""What are you looking for? Or are you just looking."" in a tone that suggested I wasn't welcome. I then told her I had heard good things about her store and had always wanted to stop in. No response.  The store has a musty smell, the clothing while some were nice- most were outdated.  The reason for the 2 stars: her jewelry. She does a great job at displaying jewelry.   Customer service? None. Had she been more welcoming I would have ignore the musty smell and dated pieces."
Close to everything. Spacious room Weird layout. Getting in and out is a journey of a couple elevators and stairs. Sort of a maze. But it does keep the mobs out. Kids liked the place. Much quieter than most strip hotels.
"Worst qt Ever, an employee actually threatened to power wash my car when I tried to fill up and almost all of their pumps were out of order. I will never go back"
"Lines are crazy but I'm thinking its probably because its brand new. The space is nice and the resident DJ lineup is great. They still seem to be figuring out how to manage the herds of people that they let in but it just opened so they're forgiven for now. The guest list line is awkwardly located and you need to go around the other side to find it.  If its crowded its hard to find an area with a decent view or a decent space. All of the areas available to stand in wind up being right in the path of people walking around so your options are either stand somewhere and got knocked into or just keep walking laps around the place.   My main issue here was the weird layout and stairs everywhere. You can take elevators from floor to floor but there's a lot of sets of 2-4 steps up or down seemingly randomly located all around the main room and it seems that some of the job's of the bouncers is just to shine flashlights on them so people see them.   Girls, don't even wear heels its not even worth it your feet will kill you the next day from hiking all those stairs all night and it will probably be so crowded there no one will even notice you're in flats. It would have been 4 stars if not for the random stair situations."
"Daniel and Lind were great, flexible and very helpful.  They made the day less grueling!"
"Firstly,,, I spend over $800 a month at QT stations in Arizona exclusively just on gas, sodas, kitchen, and etc. Now for the meat of this thing; the area is getting a little tough at sundown. Next door is a mental health / homeless shelter. Plus, you have drunk / cracked out homeless wandering the ""hood"". You got individuals coming up to you aggressively panhandling to the point where it is in the grey area of threatening / intimidating / attempted robbery. The staff at the store refuse to ""patrol"" the lot, thus resulting in confrontations between drunk belligerent homeless subjects and normal customers like myself. I have complained so many times to the store staff, asst mgrs, and store manager. Useless. Nothing is done except ""oh, we called PPD"". When the drunk continues towards me in an aggressive and threatening manner demanding money, this is where pepper spray gets presented and the tables are turned and I am no longer ""prey"" for the criminal. Why should I have to ""gear up"" just to go to this crappy store and get a soda? I expect better of QT. This stuff is basically Circle K kind of behavior and exactly why I don't patronize Circle K. I will not return to this location till corporate resolves this matter. Armed security is needed in the evenings / early nights. As far as the ladies, make sure you know how to defend yourselves with training, training, and more training. Make sure and bring your defensive tools as permitted by law. You might need them at this location in the evening ; (   Quit depending on PPD to provide security for your store # 440. It is private property and QT corporation is responsible to provide for the customer's well being and safety while they are on the premises. Not, the PPD. Filed complaint with QT Corporate Office regarding this incident as well."
Daniel is great to work with! His team is very professional and did a great job. Highly recommend them for all your moving needs. Best moving company I've used this far.
I love Barros I grew up eating it and use to walk to it when it was on 43rd Ave and Bell years ago.  This pizza is one of the best in the valley and you can't go wrong with their lunch specials which is perfect. Which is crazy nowadays when you go to lunch anywhere they want you to drop 20 bucks for a meal and the quality isn't there.  Barros has quality with a great price.
"Truly wasn't too happy about this buffet. Especially since were at the Wynn, the buffet should be as great as the restaurant. The food wasn't kept hot and was pretty bland. I wouldn't recommend coming to this buffet. However if you're looking for the best buffet in Vegas go to wicked spoon in the Cosmo. You'll never go to any other buffet after that."
"The food is alright. Kinda mediocre though. Had sesame chicken, crab Rangoon, and a spring roll. All was alright. Likely to return due to convenience and price."
"Don't waste  your time or money here. I ordered take out.. Was quoted 30 minutes. After 45 minutes, no food. I called back...got a story that it was about to leave the restaurant then.. 20 minutes later, still no food. Finally got my food after one hour and 30 minutes.. And guess what---was missing parts of my order (egg rolls and crab puffs, plus 2 liter of soda).What did arrive was lukewarm--and I live just a mile and a half from their location The lady answering the phone kept saying I am not the manager.. I can't do anything.."
I really love this buffet! I stayed in Vegas for a week and everyday we ate out to 2 or 3 places a day. This was the first one we went to and my favorite. We went at dinner time. The seafood was amazing. I love the crab legs. I am use to eating hot crablegs. Here they served them cold. Which is still fine. Also the crab legs were already cut so no messy eating (well...less of a mess). I only ate seafood but my other favorite part was the desert! They were all in cute small portions!  My service was fair and the food was great!
"All hype I say. All. Hype.  To start, we ordered the Paella Arancini ($13).  Our waiter brought out 3 round crusted balls... wha??  It turned out to be really good.  A lot of flavor, it's like eating a bite-size version of paella.  Nice start.  We both opted for salad... I had the BLT Salad ($11) while my boyfriend ordered the Beso Beso Salad ($14).  Nothing fancy or unique that made these salads stand out.  The bacon was thick and salty and somewhat overpowering over the rest of the salad including the bleu cheese dressing.  For our  main entree, since they were out of the Kansas City Strip (a steakhouse out of steak on a Saturday  night???), I had the 12oz Filet Mignon cooked 'medium' ($42) and my boyfriend ordered the Crispy Striped Bass ($38).  My steak was dry... even the center was dry... perfect shade of pink, but dry.  The striped bass was crispy alright, but rich in salt.  Very salty.  Personally, I like salty foods, but anyone can pan fry a striped bass for less that what Beso charges.  We also had the Asparagus ($10) and Mac & Cheese ($9) for our sides.  I enjoyed the aspagarus as it was sauteed in garlic.  The mac & cheese was just ok... and me being a self-proclaimed mac & cheese connoisseur, I was disappointed.  It was creamy and rich but it was lacking flavor.  Just bland and soft... nothing more than cheese & pasta.  I was extremely disappointed with my experience here and will most likely not be returning.  I think I'll stick to restaurants owned by well-known chefs than well-known actors/actresses."
"The food is OK.  Solid, traditional American fare ~ lots of grease, lots of calories, lots of carbs!    Gotta be doing something right given their wait time is soooooooo long?!    If in the mood for good food and not in a hurry"
"If I could go 3 1/2 I would, but it was loud and the service was kind of slow. The sides weren't any good-we had the macaroni and cheese and the zuccini and squash. The fries were alright. The fried green tomatoes and okra appetizers were really good. The fried chicken was ok-really greasy and the waffles were ok. I am glad we tried it to see what all the hoopla is about, but I don't need to come back."
"This Starbucks is conveniently located in a strip mall, so it's nice to be able to grab a cuppa while running errands. The cafe is always clean and organized, and the staff are friendly and efficient with taking orders and getting drinks out in a reasonable amount of time. Whenever I'm in this area, I enjoy stopping in here and treating myself to a nice latte or what have you. It's a calming and relaxing space."
Pretty decent local place. Not bad for lunch. Decent comfort-style food but a little too greasy. Always a bit too hot inside and they REALLY need to improve their ventilation.
Went here last night for daughters birthday. Ample seating for Saturday night. Cashiers were friendly every time we needed something. We're willing to warm up some remaining pizza for us due to late arrivals. Four stars is for manager telling us to get our limes from salad bar instead of serving them with our beer. Sorry to bother you dude. All in all was a good experience.
"I've eaten at the Hollywood location and thought the food was alright.  After having some drinks at the Mandarin Oriental decided to give Beso another try.  Beso has a romantic  ambiance and great location with a fountain view.   As soon as my date and I sat down we were greeted by one of the wait staff who was so intent on selling us a bottle of wine.  After making it clear 3 times that we didn't want a bottle she finally stopped pushing and we ordered some mixed drinks.  Our waiter then came to take our order but again just like his associate kept pushing for the up sell and items we did not want again not taking no for an answer, I found this to be very annoying.  I've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Vegas but have never had a wait staff so blatantly disregard my initial response.   I finally ordered the bone in fillet and my date had the pan seared salmon, both meals were average at best, plenty of better steaks and restaurants in Vegas.    Overall- Beautiful restaurant, average cuisine for the money, great specialty cocktails and extremely pushy waiters."
"Even though I heard mixed reviews from different people, I was extremely hyped to go to Hakkasan because of their consistent DJ lineups and vast amount of advertising.  We ended up booking a room at MGM on Thursday, July 11 to go to Tommy Trash at Hakkasan.  Here are my pros and cons about the club:  Pros: + Free admission when we showed up at 1:45 (yay for being girls!) + Spacious and lots of room to move + Decent sound system + Quick, efficient bartenders and cocktail servers + Our table was in the middle of the dancefloor so we were able to see everything! + Clean bathrooms  Cons: - Awkward stage setup -- depending on where you were, you weren't really able to see Tommy Trash - Cheap looking decor - No special effects, frills, or amazing lighting - Dress code wasn't enforced -- if I knew there would be girls in maxi dresses and flip flops, I would have probably dressed more down - Strict ID checks (Mine was looked at up and down for a good minute) - Long line for elevators  I would probably go back to Hakkasan if a DJ I liked was spinning, but I was definitely underwhelmed with my experience compared to other Vegas nightclubs.  For a place that's hemorrhaging money to bring in the biggest DJs, they could definitely do a lot more to their setup and decor."
"The food is average. The sesame chicken is hit or miss. Sometimes tons of dark meat sometimes half dark half medium meat. If you ask for white meat chicken they just give you the chicken from the sweet and sour dish and just a huge side of sesame, peanut whatever kind of sauce. I guess it's family run so the kids that ring me out are usually pretty chill and efficient."
I went here to try the chicken and waffles since I believe that is their specialty. There's nothing special to it to be honest. It doesn't come with any gravy and you should pay an extra a dollar for it? Seriously? I think it's overpriced for the quality of the food. It was packed when I went here and the service is quite slow. The server is pretty friendly and helpful though.
"I have had Barros at 2 other locations and loved the pizza and the service. However, I will not be returning to this location. I called in my order for take out and arrived @ time it was supposed to be ready for pick up. I was told it would be a few more min and took a seat. After waiting 25 more minutes (seated in front of a grip of staff working the front), a manager came from the back and asked what I was waiting on. He then pulled it from the warmer beside all the front desk staff. Yes, my order had been ready this whole time! All the staff knew I was waiting for my take out order and didn't bother to check this or follow up? What is worse is that they sent me on my way with that food that had been sitting there the whole time and no, I was not offered fresh food nor a refund. I was too tired of being there in the less than inviting restaurant listening to less than professional convos amongst the staff to do anything about it. Needless to say, the food wasn't fresh or tasty and the experience was all so ridiculous, I could only laugh about it and say...that just happened! I give 2 stars because no staff was rude or anything. They seemed to truly not know better."
The selection here was ok. There were 3 women working and 1 was AWESOME but the other 2 were not. Shoe selection was dated as were the couture lines as well. The place is clean and very organized.
Kinda disappointed because I was looking at all the good reviews and being a Mexican myself you can judge good authentic food when you taste it. They serve salsa and chips like every mex restaurant so nothing new there. The fideo soup was actually realllly good. But then I ordered green enchiladas and sadly it wasn't good at all. The tortillas were soggy and the green chili sauce just didn't taste good I thought it was a little watery. Another thing is the complimentary desert that is nice but overall I would say I'm sticking to Lindo Michoacán.
"Please do not hire Dignity moving. They damaged many pieces of my furniture. One piece beyond repair. They issued 50% credit to rectify their carelessness. The desk they broke a leg off of was taken back to their office for ""repair"". Daniel advised me they would just try to wood glue it so I requested they just bring it back and I'll repair myself. The condition it was returned in was deplorable. There's a black footprint and some kind of black oil on it. Not to mention a portion of the wood it missing so it cannot be repaired. When I asked Daniel to cover the cost of the desk and refund moving charges he had the audacity to tell me I damaged my daughters desk myself and that he knows people like me that are just out to get money! That's insane!!! When threatened to contact the BBB he told me to go ahead because they weren't going to do anything for me. At this point voices were raised and Daniel told me I was learning a valuable lesson today. His words.  I'm a 44yr old married mother of one child. I am not out to get money from my movers. Anyone who has ever moved knows there's a lot of work to be done.  Bottom line is that this is a fairly new business. They have no idea what their doing. They do not wrap your furniture and it get damaged and dirty on their rented uhaul. They may be a bit cheaper then the next guys but you get what you pay for.  I'm attaching pics so you can see what type of work they do."
Every time we come the food is amazing and the service is exceptional! Highly recommend this place.
Great store and friendly staff made my Spring Break purchase fun!  Great ambiance with the restaurant attached too.
"Blush is adorable, with stylist who are welcoming and amazing.Highly recommend Blush. (Cassandra is wonderful!)"
Local Starbucks - great service and very friendly crew.  More space than it may appear from the outside.  Comfortable to work or web surf and usually easy to find close by parking
"I had a bite of the buffalo chicken pizza at Taste of Charlotte this year. It was good, and what you'd expect from a wood fired pizza joint; fresh ingredients, thin crust, good crunch. I would be interested in trying the restaurant."
Your typical vegas buffet. They have a large variety of food selection. Nice selection of dessert as well. I highly enjoy the decor of The Buffet at The Wynn. Very elegant and beautiful and definitely makes me feel like it was worth the price. Service wasn't all that great. Love the Asian selection. I still feel there could have been a bit more selection to choose from.
"For a Las Vegas buffet, I was told this place was semi pricier than the rest, but it is so worth it.  I was mildly disappointed that they didn't have raw oysters or a better selection of sushi, but their other dishes made up for it.  I went back many times for the chicken salad wraps, Lamb, freshly made pasta and pumpkin Tortellini.    The chef's station there can create almost any pasta masterpiece you desire, with fresh ingredients and please please add tonnes of roasted garlic!   At about $50 a person it's a good value.  Just be prepared to stay a while and enjoy their hot chocolate while you're at it."
"I hated the entire experience. Uncomfortably crowded. Rude people. Tiny dance floor. Steve Aoki didn't come out until 2 am and by that time my patience had run out. I will not spend go to this club if it were free, much less $70 a person."
"Nothing about Beso, in particular, makes me want to return for a second visit.   We had a reservation but were advised to wait at the bar an extra 10-15 minutes prior to being seated in a dining room with many open tables- most likely to squeeze an extra $13 for a Jack Daniels & $14 for a Belvedere cocktail from us.  We were seated at a nice, ample booth looking out at the City Center fountain/cul de sac and with view of the entire dining room. The service was very professional and informed.   Their lobster bisque was extremely salty.   Lobster mac & cheese was yummy, as a leftover- from what my date later told me.   I thought it was a unique cut of meat to offer, but for $48, their 16oz bone-in Filet left much to be desired. I later learned that several other restaurants in the city were offering bone-in filet cuts.   Overall, a one-time experience. There are many other steakhouses in town that I would opt to go to before Beso."
Where els can you go for 2 slices of pizza and a drink for under 5 bucks??  This place was awesome 20 years ago when I came here for lunch in high school and  is still awesome when I bring my kids here now.  I just recently had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was better than i was expecting.  This is also the go to place if we are watching football or just chillen with friends.
"Golden Turtle reigned supreme as the best Pho place in Toronto for many years. Their broth is definitely one of the best but their success has gotten to the heads of this family run business. They are ALWAYS super busy as well which means they no longer have to work hard. Their service is not only poor, but they are regularly rude to customers. The service size of meat in their Pho has slowly gone down over the years as well. If you love Pho, you'll still do great at this place but there are other new and old Pho restaurants that you will slowly see beating out Golden Turtle on the top rankings as years go by in my opinion.  Lastly, they only accept cash which can be a real pain if you aren't prepared and of course they have their own cash machine in the place which will rob you of $3 per transaction!"
"I really loved this buffet for its wide variety of food choices and dessert. Unlike most buffets in Vegas, the interior is bright, which is one aspect that I really liked about The Buffet (not to mention even how beautiful it is!). The quality of the food is great, and everything was just amazing. The dessert was amazing too- there is also a crepe bar! The price point is also great- I will definitely be coming back."
"We met friends af the end of the mid-week lunch crowd on the 2nd level patio on a warm sunny day.  This our first visit and  had the special of the day ""fish tacos"" while the other couple had the fish sandwich.  The ""fish tacos"" are apparently not always available but we found them to be excellent.  We had great service including the manager checking periodically and bringing new drinks as opposed to re-fills."
"The pho was pretty average, lacked the richness and complexity of the broth at other places I've been. The rice dishes were also pretty average and unimpressive. Their rice was relatively dry, but the pork chop was well-seasoned. The fried spring rolls were pretty standard, but had a somewhat unpleasant fryer oil flavour. In the end, it's not bad, but it wasn't great and there are definitely better options nearby."
Staff are great and they offer a great selection. Prices are a little high but it is a small brick and motar shop so it's to be expected. What needs work is one of the owner's attitude. She is about as personable as a serial killer
The food was really good. This particular location has too many staff working. All the employees were very loud including the manager. Was not properly greeted coming in or extending the restaurant. Would definitely recommend Barro's but would highly recommend Barro's training their stuff better and being more professional.
"I travel a lot to Las Vegas for business and have eaten here a few times and wanted to yelp out my experience given the largely negative reviews of this place.  The biggest complaint seems to be the service level and the one time I have eaten at this restaurant, the service was kind of lousy (I was told by the bartender to wait to be seated by the host, but lots of people came in and sat down at a table and I subsequently followed).  However, the service level today was much better and my server was very friendly.  I was a few hours early for my flight back home so I just decided to hang out here and do some work while waiting.    I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which also has apples, raisins, and tarragon.  This is one of my favorite ""to go items"" of any airport eatery that I have been to and this establishment's offering was tasty today.  The sandwich is accompanied with French fries that is smothered with cheese, truffle oil, and chives.  They give a very generous portion of this side which was definitely a plus.    Compared to other non-airport restaurants, I would agree with the general consensus that the service is sub-par and it is kind of pricey.  However, the quality of the offerings are good and I do keep on coming back here when I am at Las Vegas airport."
Andrea Abshere rules!  She takes it all in and makes you look and more importantly feel beautiful!  LOVE this woman!
"Good pizza. Good pricing on pizza and salad. Staff in friendly and informative. This is my go to place on pizza day. They have gluten free pizza if you're a celiac (I am not, I get to eat that tasty gluten) they also are corn free (my wife is allergic to corn)"
"I won't give it the ""best pizza"" in town... But it sure out beats a lot of them! We order the thin crust pepperoni/sausage and a 25 hot wings .. Good prizes.. Fast service and friendly staff.. Which always helps me decide if I will return. We have ate here a few times now and we will continue to come back"
"Good apartments and attitude at the office, maintenance folks bit grumpy and reason i would say, they dont have an annual maintenance check. most of the apt have age-old rusted hinges that fall, stoves that need repair, lights with delays and alarm that turns on and off at its own will at times and roaches in summer, less if u planning not to cook!!! lol,, I would suggest to make sure to have a regular /yearly check on the stuff in all apt."
"Extremely extremely slow. If you're calling a prescription in, expect to wait hours. If you go in to refill it, expect to wait even longer. Very very slow staff and service. They don't care, and it is obvious. How long does it take to fill a 6 pill antibiotic bottle with one other person waiting ahead of me!?! Unbelievable!"
"Came here during lunch with my office on a beautiful spring day, so we sat outside in their patio area. They were a bit busy considering it was the lunch time rush. The food was so tasty! We had the chips with guacamole and cheese to start with. For lunch I ordered the blackened fish tacos, which were so yummy and very filling. My dish also came  with some plantains that were in this white creamy sauce and OMG it was so scrumptious! I loved that my dish came with its own desert :) The cons was the service! Our server was nice, but so SLOW! We ordered our drinks when we first sat down and it took him about 10 minutes to bring them out. Plus we had to flag him down to remind him about our appetizer we ordered. I'll definitely give this place another try based on their food and great patio, but the service definitely needs to step it up."
"All in all, the steak was delicious but the staff could use a better attitude.  When we first came in, I informed the hostess that we had a Travelzoo voucher (4 courses plus champagne for 2 for $79), to which she snickered with the hostess next to her.  A little rude!    We had reservations and were seated right away.  Our waiter initially was a little rude to us too, telling us the things we couldn't order on the menu.  Our voucher didn't say there were any limitations, so it was a little surprising.  In any case, it's Vegas and we rolled with it.  When asked for beverage choices, we told him we wanted water (we don't drink soda and were already a few cocktails in) and he told us ""oh...you want the REGULAR water?"" as though the regular water was crap.  As my boyfriend imitated later, ""oh, you want the peasant water?""  Regular water was fine by the way!  For our appetizer, we ordered the chile relleno which was alright.  Not bad, but not notable either.  We both ordered the beso beso salad.  The orange vinegarette was a little odd for my taste but was alright as well.   The delicious part came with our 12 oz filet mignon steaks.  My my they were tasty!  Our dessert was churros which came with a delicious caramel dipping sauce.  The champagne, however, not so delicious.  We were surprised that gratuity was automatically included for a table of 2.  Don't restaurants only do that for larger parties?  I guess they wanted to make sure they were being tipped on the $198 which the meal was worth.       The jury is out as to whether or not I would come back next time I'm in Vegas.  The food was good but the rude treatment makes me want to take my business elsewhere."
"Average McDonald's, came here for lunch after shopping at markville mall.   The food tastes the same as every other McDonald's restaurant.   When I went there were so many flies it was unbelievable. When I went to pick up my tray from the front there was flies crawling around my fries! The employees saw that and gave us new fries.   Also because the restaurant is next to the Asian supermarket the smell of raw fish sweeps through the store every once in a while.   One of the worst McDonald's I've been to, just go to the drive though and eat in your car."
"This is a must read! Ok, food was actually good, but one star for one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.  I read all the yelp reviews and wanted to give this place a chance, so I did and won't do it again. Please, please, please don't go here. I called in an order to pick up, the guy couldn't understand me and said 5-7 minutes. Drove over there, clarified my order (which he had wrong) and waited. Apparently they were short staffed so the ""waitress"" was doing a delivery. After waiting 10-15 more minutes I gave him a credit card, he said he didn't know how to work the machine, so I patiently waited for the ""waitress"" aka delivery lady to come back.   This is where it gets good, she charges me a wrong amount, less, but I didn't notice and just wanted to get out of there. So I generously tip them out of guilt and then get a call from them asking for my credit card because she didn't charge me for everything. I explained I wasn't driving back there, she asked for my CC over the phone and refused. I felt their service was horrible and it was their mistake. Had I not wasted 20+ minutes there (as my food got cold) I would have not been so stubborn. Bottom line- don't do it! Money is too precious to waste on places like this."
"It is tucked between a real estate office and entrance to office building.  Watch out or you'll miss it. I had dinner with my husband here on weekday night.  Was about quarter full, not bad for a week night.  Not a fine dining place, more causal dinning but still nice (Cloth napkins).    I ordered the duck squash risotto and my husband the special salmon and lemon risotto.  I enjoyed my entrée thought there was a good amount of duck in it. Could of used some more butternut squash chunks and squash could have been cooked a bit more.  Still I enjoyed overall. My husband was thrilled with his salmon thought it was cooked perfectly and risotto was perfect accompaniment.   We also ordered the house white to go with our meal. I liked that they had a house wine could get a half litter rather than just glass. It was quite a nice wine too.  We had dessert which I thoroughly enjoyed crème brulee.  Either a small or large size could be ordered. My regret was that I got the small, it was that good. The funny thing of note was that for an Italian restaurant not one dessert was Italian.    It's a simple but nice place.  The food good, simple and was moderately priced.  I would go there again."
"I think the buffet is just ok. I think I would prefer Bellagio's one instead. It is not worth waiting over an hour to eat there. The table I had was so close to the entrance. As I was eating my dinner, I was facing all the people who were waiting to be seated. I wish they would not put some of the tables so close to the entrance."
"I was told this place has excellent Mexican food, but they were mistaken. To start my experience, my fiancé ordered a coke and received a Pepsi. The server never mentioned they only had Pepsi products. Oh and my other friend ordered a water and received a Pepsi. They brought us some sort of soup before the meal which tasted a lot like a can of microwave noodle soup. Not impressed. When I got my beef enchilada the meat was actually cooked wonderfully, however, it was accompanied by the most horrendous beans I've ever tasted. I was just not impressed with this place at all."
"This place has the perfect decor and atmosphere for a Mexican restaurant but my carne Asada quesadilla was completely terrible, I could only finish one piece.  I had such high hopes for this place but I can't believe they messed up something as basic as a quesadilla."
"Was there for Happy Hour on Thursday, August 28th.  Service was excellent and the food matched the service.  Our waiter, Carl, was extremely helpful and made the experience extremely enjoyable.  Definitely will return."
"Tried this restaurant out on a recommendation of a neighbor. Had the General Tso's Shrimp which was good but would probably be a lot better if you ate it in there dining room. If we order that again to go we will definitely get the sauce on the side to prevent the shrimp from being soggy. Wings were just OK and IMO the fried rice was kinda dry. The food was just OK,  nothing to write home or brag about. May try them again on a late rainy Friday night."
"I was  supposed to move on March 1st , but an opportunity became available to move on Tuesday February 28th. Daniel at Dignity made the adjustments and made this happen quickly, affordably and professional. I would recommend Dignity moving to anyone looking for a quality mover that will take care of your things as if it was their own. Thank you Dignity moving for making this happen on short notice."
"I went on a quest several years ago to find the best fish tacos, and Tommy Bahamas won hands down!  Love them!!  It's hard to decide what to order since they are so good, and so is the steak salad, and the blackberry brandy barbeque pulled pork sandwich.  Carb bisque chowder never disappoints either.  Save room for their famous pina colada whipped cream cake.  Haven't met anyone that would turn it down.  A perfect way to end a perfect meal!"
"Very good pizza.  The crust was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside - the way it should be.  The pepperoni was perfectly crispy on the edges and oily in the middle - the way it should be.    Cheap, clean, friendly, and plenty of seating."
"My experience at 12Fifty5 has been so great! I love the modern style of the apartments, the friendly staff, and all the fun events they have for the residents. It makes living here so nice! I leased a furnished apartment, which made moving so much easier. I would definitely recommend this apartment to students."
"I had my first haircut and style with Jessica, and it won't be the last!  She was fabulous, and I love what she did with my hair.  I showed her a picture of what I was looking for, but she did modify it a little bit to take into account what would work for my face shape, hair texture, etc.  I enjoy the end result more than the picture!  She even got me in last-minute, which I appreciate.    The salon has a very boutique-y feel to it, which makes it feel more unique and comfy than other places that can feel stale.  They also offer other beauty services, such as manicures/pedicures, waxing, and skin care.  My cut (which included wash and style) was $35, which I think is pretty standard for this area.  But it was definitely worth it, and I highly recommend Jessica.  P.S. I wish they had a website.  I enjoy businesses that have websites."
One of my favorite places to go eat while I'm in Phoenix.  Try the goat cheese appetizer and you will not be dissapointed.
"What can I say? It was cheap? It was centrally located? It was cheap?  You get the point... it was cheap. My girlfriend booked it for her bachelorette party and we were splitting it between 8 people. For 3 nights we paid around $130. Cheap, I know. But was the cheapness worth it? I guess I'm trying to figure that out...  The rooms weren't bad by any means. It was clean. It was nice to have a kitchenette. Especially the full size fridge, which held a lot of... drinks cold. I wish there was an option to get two double beds instead of a king bed with sofa pull out, but the pull out, which I slept on, wasn't too uncomfortable.   But the catch? It's ""connected"" to the Cosmo. But to get to the Cosmo you literally have to go to an elevator, across a hallway, to another elevator, across the hallway to another elevator, through the laundry room... okay, I'm lying about that last part, but you get it, right? It's confusing. And far. We basically gave up and went out the main entrance of the Jockey Club and walked around to the main entrance of the Cosmo.  We were also under the impression that we had access to all three of Cosmo pools. You do not. You only have access to the pool on the 14th floor. That pool is also up an elevator, through a hallway, down a longer hallway and up another elevator. It's far. And the pool is small and overcrowded. There were absolutely no chairs available when we arrived at 10am (early for Vegas standards!). The pool food menu is also incredibly limited, with not even a nacho platter on it! I'll admit, the gauc and chips were okay, but just okay. There is a small pool at the Jockey Club, but let's be honest, it was boring. No music, no food and NO sunlight. What's the point??  Would I stay here again? No. I'd pay a little more to be in a normal hotel. But to be clear, it was not dirty or uncomfortable. Just inconvenient. And I'm not a gambler, so the pool is really important to me. I was not into the pool choice. To me, the best pool in Vegas of the three places I've stayed, Planet Hollywood and Aria, Aria was the best by far. Oh yeah, I may have snuck into the Bellagio pool too, and that was nice, but very laid back (aka older crowd). Why go to Vegas and not break the rules a little, right?"
"I did a package for the Cirque Elvis show at Aria which included dinner here. The atmosphere is elegant, dark and ""clubby"" with awesome background music through a well designed system. The pre-fixe menu had nothing to do with Elvis which was fine however there were a few miscues. The food was delicious and prepared perfectly albeit small servings. The Caesar salad was good, the bread and butter perfection as was the filet. I never got the vegetable side that was supposed to accompany the meal. I left hungry and wanting to go somewhere to eat. I was not expecting anything with the churros dessert however it was the best part of the meal! Delicious and served with 2 little cups, one a cream sauce and the other a type of butterscotch. Excellent!  I would say a nice date place or go to for churros."
"I'm not a big fan of buffets in general, but this is a pretty bad buffet for the price.  You get a lot of options; salad bar, soups, italian, prime rib, indian, asian, seafood, etc. but none of them are really good.    After a long day of losing money, lounging at a pool or getting over a hangover, I would like a nice juicy steak or at least a few good pieces of chicken with some good sides of vegetables and some bread. This place offered a prime rib that seemed overcooked, some weird squashes and hard dinner rolls. Score!  The best thing I had there was a sea bass dish and I don't even like seafood, so I don't know if that's a compliment to the seafood or a criticism of the rest of the food they offer.  Probably the latter.  Actually, I take that back, the best thing I had there was the dessert.  I think that's the only reason I give this place 2 stars instead of one."
"==Buffet at Wynn== I had a $50 credit here and the buffet here passes as a upscale gourmet restaurant! Better than the Belagio buffet. I would recommend the dinnner buffet and it's worth every penny. Skip all the carb items and get all the meat if you're a T-REX. Rack of lamb ! Prime Rib ! Pork ! It's all scrumptious! The crab legs were okay, I still think it was a bit too salty. But the endless amounts of food to choose, try one of everything if you want and save some room for the dessert as well.   Don't listen to the buffet haters. People think buffets are just to eat and eat and eat and eat and eat.. oh hey and eat some more. eat more? eat some more, keeping eating? Sure why not eat. eat eat eat eat and eat.   WRONG. Buffets are about the variety of food so even if you have 1 plate only, at least you have like 10 different things on your plate if you can fit it. It's Vegas baby, you're here to waste all your money and go all out or GTFO and go home. Enjoy this buffet because I'll tell you now, you won't regret it !  A++ Quality here."
"So have been here when they first opened as a ghetto joint and now with all the nice remodeling  The food is still good (u might get a heart attack or cavity w the sugar in their kool-aid) but one thing that hasn't changed is the service is still as slow as dang molasses.  I have a toddler now and the long wait to get service, drinks, and our food was not sitting well with her or me. 40 min wait to get seated, 10 min for a waiter to appear, close to an hour for food and waiter to reappear.  I think if you're looking for a place to go hang with adults to catch up; the wait is worth the wait.   Dress code: ghetto to fab to ghetto fab is all gravy in here."
"Overall, delicious food. The brunch selection is probably the best. Although the wait is around 15-30 minutes, it's definitely worth it!   I had this amazing mango pineapple fish. Mmm, that's the one thing I remember because it was so rich, flaky, but light and fresh at the same time!  There was enough variety and even had a separate dessert room which had delicious gelato.   What really made the experience special is the decor! The main focal point was the garden room where there is a beautiful skylight and hanging flowers and plants. Gorgeous place to have brunch, breakfast, or lunch in.  It is a decent price if you do not go on holidays. I believe on holidays it is around $35-40 for breakfast or dinner. On regular days, I believe $15-20 which is amazing for their food."
"So disappointed at my dining experience here... I used to love this place but it went out of my mind a little when they moved locations. Well I decided to stop in a few days ago and found that the place was pretty empty... strange I thought bc this place was always crowded and lively...I should have taken the hint... apparently others feel the way I do. service was very slow even though it wasn't crowded.. took forever just to get water... oh yea also ordered the fried jalapeños twice and they were never brought out...I ordered chili rellanos... when they came out the chesse was a hard brick of cold cheese and the flavor was bland. Long story short.. this used to be the bomb but looks like they lost their touch.....  This is an add on after the manager's comment: I love how the manager attacks anyone that has something critical to say about his restaurant.. instead of apologizing for the incident and trying to make it better... and no sir I did not bring it up to the waiter because I'm not looking for a free meal.. it was edible and I ate it therefore I feel I should pay for it.. it was however NOT good... furthermore after my wife(who left a review as well) discovered a 3 inch long piece of ""tissue paper"" ...as you so duly corrected her in her review... buried inside her Asado salad we were really just ready to cut our losses and leave... your contempt for the customer is simply amazing and I was going to drop the issue with the foreign substance in her food but now we will move forward with a complaint to the health district. And of course we will never nor will any of our friends eat there again."
"Lots of choices for food in the Charlotte airport these days. Genghis Grill is similar to their full size restaurant format, except that instead of building your own bowl you get one of their premade bowls. I assume that you can add or remove any ingredients, but I went with the Firecracker Shrimp as it comes.  A good amount of shrimp with bean sprouts, onions and peppers. And a lot of spice. This was HOT. Lots of hot pepper and their ""dragon sauce"" on it. And that's a good thing as it was tasty and filling and it took me a good 15 minutes to eat.  Probably not the kind of food you want to eat on the plane. There are many tables here in the atrium area where you can get some sunshine and watch the folks coming through TSA security.  By far, one of the better choices in CLT for a meal."
"Greystar peoperty management has run the place to the ground.  They spent hundreds of thousands to repaint a building that  did not need to be repainted but will do the bare minimum for it residents when they need maitance and upkeep.  the roaches are out of control the landscaping is grap ...they are basically slum lords.  The only good thing about the place is, location."
"I've only been here a few times and being so close to home, I thought I'd utilize them for my alteration needs. After I dropped off my dress/work pants, I was contacted by the alteration lady, who then provided me with a quote of about 14.99, which I went through with. She asked if I wanted them dry cleaned, which I specifically said no, since pants were not dry cleaned required (why would I pay more, if not necessary).   Pants were picked up 10/21. The young lady at the counter charged me about 6-8 dollars more. I gave her my cc without noticing the difference in the amount originally quoted. It wasn't until after the cc was ran, that I remembered I was quoted a total of 14.99. When I asked the young lady regarding the price difference, she said pants were requested to be dry cleaned, (hence the price difference). I informed her that it's not what I informed the alteration lady when she called, in fact, when she asked me if i wanted them dry cleaned, I specifically said no thank you. I wanted to get home and I really didn't want to make a big deal about it, so I proceeded with signing my receipt and exited the cleaners with my overpriced service.   I thought this was over and done with, until the following day...boy did I have a surprise. I received a call from an erratic lady. It was the alteration lady, informing me that I had lied in telling the young lady at the counter that I didn't request pants to be dry cleaned. Furthermore, she continued to yell at me informing me that I was wrong and that she remembers me asking to have my pants dry cleaned and that she had been working for over 11 years and would not get the order wrong. Seriously? I thought to myself, is this really happening?! It was the most awkward phone call I've ever had. I asked her kindly to look in the system and she would know that I've never taken items for dry cleaning, simply alterations, so I'm not sure where she all of a sudden wanted dry cleaning now?! I was at work when I received her erratic phone call, which left me in complete awe. My mouth just dropped knowing I had not even complained, instead just paid the amount and went on my merry way, only to receive such a crazy call the following morning. I was extremely shocked in her poor taste of words and lack of customer service in this lady. I hope she gets it together. If you have alterations beware! You might get an erratic phone call from this angry lady accusing you of making stuff up, just saying!"
"We had lunch here as we waited for our plane. Our waitress was very nice.  I asked for a substitution and she was accommodating. DMD ordered the chicken wrap and I ordered a turkey Reuben. The chicken wrap was reported as very good. The Reuben was ok. Not enough sour kraut, but maybe that was a good thing. There is a full bar and plenty of TV's."
"The pizza is amazing here: we had mushroom and sausage as well as pepperoni.  We also had the regular garlic bread and cheesy bread which were pretty good. They also deliver to our area which is kinda on the outskirts, so that's a huge plus. Will for sure be eating here again soon!"
Great pho restaurant in the area. Soups are delicious although rare times a bit salty/oily. Overall a great menu I have been ordering (sit down and takeout although they do offer delivery) for years. Pad Thai in my opinion is one of the best in the area I absolutely cannot get enough of the sauce. Also as an appetizer try the butter chicken wings they are phenomenal. Fairly clean and friendly service never had a problem. Open until midnight is a good bonus as well.
"Me and some friends stopped in here today while we were looking for a quick place to find a drink near Union.   We walked in to this place and thought it would be a smaller pub style place.  The decor was really great, I totally felt under dressed there in just a pair of shorts and a v neck.   The menu wasn't too big, but it looked pretty varied.  The server told us the specials, and we just each had a pint of sommersby.  It was a cute place, and I definitely want to try it again when we have more time :)  3 stars for now!"
"I've been here quite a few times before.  Food is alright - not the best but still good.  I had the house special dry noodle (H01 I believe) and it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be considering that it was $8.  The shrimp pancake was super greasy and oil just oozed out in every bite.  My boyfriend got the house special pho (P01) and there was a lot more noodle than meat.  Broth was ok, not authentic to the vietnamese style though.  I finished my meal before he did and they cleared up my bowl pretty quick BUT they also took away the bean sprout plate that came with my boyfriend's pho - not sure why?  We also ordered a taro bubble tea slush.  It wasn't as slushy as other places, more watery if anything.  Tapioca was fresh and they added a lot of ice cubes in the cup to make it look full.  You don't realize how much ice they put in it until you've finished your drink (which could be in 5 minutes).  Washrooms are small, a little dirty, and cold but you can tell they tried to clean it."
"This is the worst portuguese I have ever had. It's the only option for portuguese miles around and i have tried it a couple times now.  Chicken is tasteless. Piri piri and spices are nowhere to be found. Potatoes watery, rice just bad.  Oh, and if you want something you better phone ahead...the chance of walking in and getting something is rare."
"I really don't expect much out of a food-court place, but even so, this place was pretty disappointing.  First off, I was planning on ordering a brisket plate with mac-and-cheese and hushpuppies, and an iced tea. They were out of brisket, out of mac-and-cheese, and had discontinued the hushpuppies even though they were still on the menu. Oh yeah, and there was no iced tea and no ice (they did refill the ice). So zero percent of what I wanted was available.  I ended up ordering pulled chicken, with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. The chicken was pretty dry and tasteless, even with the rub, and the sauce was pretty bland. The mashed potatoes were old, and had some kind of weird skin (not a potato skin, more like the skin you see on pudding). The corn on the cob was actually ok.  To their credit, they did give me a discounted price because of everything being unavailable.  If you're stuck eating at the food court at the outlets, I'd suggest going to one of the safer places, like the Chinese place, or the sandwich place."
"Shamika is awesome. I have long blonde hair which usually takes stylists forever to do, but she went in and did a partial highlights in no time. They came out beautiful. I will definitely be returning here. Did I mention the great prices?"
"A good place to get a break in the day time and obtain a caffeine energy rush. Usually busy but the service is fast. Coffee is served the way you like it, with attention to your specific requests. It gets hectic sometimes, so you may not be able to fully relax. But, it's still worth coming here often, if you work nearby."
"Horrible first and last experience went with a group of 12 ppl and waited 40! Minutes for someone to take our drink order then as I'm sitting after I get my water the ""owner"" is at our table and throws a shirt and tips the water over and covers my IPhone.. I calmly pick up my phone and dry it he ignores it and doesn't even cater to bringing towels for the water spill. So my friend speaks up and tells him that he covered my phone in water and my screen at this point is turning green from the water. He looks at my phone and says sorry it was an accident and I told him no worries I understood calmly stuff happens I'm not worried about the phone.. then he proceeded to tell me after it doesn't mater cause the phone is still useable and it doesn't matter about the green on the screen and it wasn't his ""problem"" at this point I'm getting pissed and another manager comes over and is very polite and takes care of it and send the ""owner"" on his way. She asked me do I need anything at all I asked for my drink I ordered 45+ minutes ago and she says yes and brings me the wrong drink then says she gave me a better one.. I ignore it and just drink it anyway. So by this time my phone screen is not working and the touch is not active anymore... never got an apology from the gentlemen that did the damage or anything other then told it's not his problem that he threw a shirt at our table unprofessionally and ruined my phone. So because the fact I decided to go eat there it cost me 175$ to insurnce claim my phone for a new one.. on top of that I'm greeted with a bill for my 20$ burrito and on top of that with the drink I was given that I didn't order placed on my buddy's bill.. Worst customer service ever! Understand accidents happen and it was buisy due to the night but it wasn't my fault this employee/owner decided to throw a shirt at a table where no one was paying attention to him. Then told it's not my fault here's your bill.  never again will I go or return with anyone or recommend it."
"On the 4th of July we brought our son out with us before we went to the ball game.  Towards the end of dinner, he got sick and ended up vomiting.  DO NOT expect the wait/bus staff to help you if this happens to your children.  2 servers and a bus boy stood there, frozen not sure what to do.  They all looked so unprofessional, like they had not seen someone throw up before.  The bus boy stood there with a wet towel in his hand, while another waiter (from a different station) had to jump in and hand me napkins.  For you parents out there...you know ""paper"" napkins only go so far.  I had to literally tell the bus boy to give me the wet rag he was holding, before he snapped out of his staring trance and walked away.  We have always loved   LoLo's, however this time was very different.  The staff was so unprofessional and cold towards us.  We saw a manager walk past us and look 3 times and he never once stopped to see what had happened or checked on us to see if we needed anything.  So disappointing!"
I don't even want to give this establishment one star. My wife has a degree in Baking and Pastry and we have both been working in the food industry for 20 years collectively. We walked into the store expressing our interest which is too bad because the pastries looked delicious and the flavors were intriguing. We were ignored and verbally expressed how we were being ignored but didn't even get acknowledged. We didn't even bother sticking around. Not worth your time. It's too bad that a place that looks so great has such HORRIBLE service.
"My boyfriend brought me here for dinner on a Friday night. We did make a reservation and even though we had to change the time at the last minute they were very accommodating. We both drank Mai Tai's all night and loved our meals. He had the Mahi Special and I had the Salmon. Both were very good, I cant wait to come here again! Bonus....the store is downstairs and I got a dress on sale with an additional discount for dining upstairs. I wish I could remember our servers name...there were 3 people taking care of us.  I would suggest the coconut shrimp as an app!"
"I can't thank Daniel and Lynn enough! It was 120 today and they rocked it. Quick, professional and a great price! I will be recommending them to all my friends and family!"
"Wasn't impressed with the food at all.  My husband and I dropped over $90 on food that was mediocre.  Service was horrible, our server never checked on us, and we were sat at a table with no condiments like salt and pepper and no bread basket was given with our soup.  (We paid over $10 each for our soup.). Food wasn't bad, but certainly not worth the inflated price.  Service and food were both extremely slow and disappointing.  Plenty of better restaurants in the area more reasonably priced.  Second experience:    We gave Tommy Bahamas a second try.  So happy we did!  Night and day difference from our first experience.  Our server Jonathan and manager Dre were both very attentive, personable and had great suggestions.    The view was beautiful sitting on the second floor with open windows overlooking the city/mountains.  We ordered the scallop sliders as an appetizer, they were incredible...my only complaint is I wish they had more as they were so tasty!  The kitchen was much more prompt  this time.   The lobster bisque soup was amazing with a spritz of lemon.   I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken which came with cauliflower mash and broccolini very tasty, and I will definitely be back to order again.  Both my husband and I throughly enjoyed this dish.  My husband ordered the Ribs which came with a cabbage island slaw and cauliflower chive mash, all very good.   For desert we had the pineapple creme brûlée.  Light , refreshing and definitely would order again.    My husband and I were extremely impressed from start to finish.  From the service, to the kitchen and the food, it was definitely an experience that will bring us back soon and on a more regular basis.  Thank you Jonathan, Patrick and Dre for doing such a stellar job!"
"I always used to forget about this as an option for great seafood in town. But after I went to recently have been back a few times. You can't really go wrong, but the tuna poke napoleon and macadamia snapper are always exceptional."
"I agree with the other reviews that attribute the success of this place to its proximity to the downtown core and the expense accounts that come with it.  I enjoyed a modestly sized ""large"" Cobb salad. Fresh, tasty, and covered by a corporate credit card."
"Finally had the chance to try lolos chicken and waffles this past sunday! I have mixed feelings about this place.   1. The chicken and waffles were yummy!   2. The wait when ordering a burger is ridiculous.  We waited about 40 minutes for our food to come out just because my husband ordered a burger.  3. We spend $11 on dessert to go (red velvet & banana pudding), both were extremely dry. The pictures totally gave us false hope. I seriously think the desserts were a week old at least.   4. The mac and cheese was okay, nothing special.   I would return but it's not a place I would go out of my way for.  P.s ~ be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes for a table on a sunday afternoon."
"I think they've gone out of business, phones turned off and website is down for the past week, When they were open they were good at what they did, cheap Americanized fast food Chinese delivery. I'm sad, and now looking for another dive Chinese place that delivers to Arcadia......"
Gross! Very average to below average food and small and. It was not a good experience! You could get over how small it is when you come pick up your food if the food was actually good but it's so average to below average Chinese that he appearance makes it so much worse.  Won't go back
"Dignity Moving was fantastic and this was the easiest move. Daniel checked in the day before and was on time on the move in date. He was professional from the start and he and his partner moved everything in quickly. There was no increase or change to the quoted rate. Hopefully we don't need to move again soon, but we will remember this team for next time we do!"
"I was very unhappy, came with a group of my family.  Saw it had good ratings but I am very unhappy.  The waiter came and helped us it seemed fast, but then after we ordered it took a very long time. Once the food got here it had absolutely no flavor, all the food we got was terrible. The tacos were terrible. The soups were over salted.   We left most of our food.. It was so bad.   very unhappy. Never recommending this place or coming here ever again."
"We came here three times in as many days. I really just couldn't get enough. The food, the service, the colorful bright garden (where we always sat) were a perfect combination. I must have eaten 30 of those creamy cheesy perogies and a dozen scoops of the Salted Caramel chocolate gelato.   The crab legs were the best I have ever had, not over cooked like so many of the other buffets I had been to and even better than most of the a la carte seafood restaurants I have visited. They were succulent and juicy, and sweet. Oh so sweet. The next day they brought out stone crab claws too! I was in heaven.   The service was fantastic and we really enjoyed Henry. He was top notch. The manager was also quite sweet and kind. Now that I am home, I am losing a bit of the weight I put on while I was there. All I can say is it is a good thing I don't live in Vegas."
"If i could give negative stars I would!!! I tried to add someone on the list and couldn't remember my number from 2 years ago and the Front Desk Milli told me ""you should have changed your number with us a long time ago so thats you fault"" and then kept hanging up on me!  Never in life had i needed to deal with such a rude person!!! This place needs to be demolished!!!  I am beyond offended! She wouldn't even take the rest of my information!!!!  WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!"
"I had the champagne brunch. The wait is 1.5 hours. They have a great variety of food but no king crab legs (They have it during dinner). The ceviche is pretty good, the omelet is only so-so while both meat at the carving station is good. The spring roll, Shu-mai and sushi rolls are nothing special - as one would expect from a buffet.  In conclusion that is a decent buffet, the price is higher than the average buffet but that is compensated by  located in Wynn Large variety"
"The decorate your own cookie was just simply a total rip off, lower your price and we would come back frequently. Over 50 dollars to frost a few cookies? Seriously."
Good food and pleasant staff. First time visiting and certainly not the last.  Thanks :)
Terrible place. I have eaten there a coupe of time and the food at first sight isnt bad until you notice all the bugs in it. The place does not have AC so the pho usually has a lot of nats. This place is gross. After complaining i have gotten another soup with another two bugs floating in it. After taking about 5 bites all together out of both plates the waiter demanded to pay when i got up and told them there was insects there again. Just awful.
"This is a yummy, adorable lil' pizza place that has so much more than just pizza! Everything from NY style pizza to Gyros to subs! The prices are reasonable, the staff is super nice, restaurant is clean, food is always hot and tasty, and they deliver til ten pm and go as far as Russell and Boulder. They are right next to the Cinadome 12 and within walking distance from old henderson so the location is nice as well!"
Kristy is amazing! I have been going to her for over 10 years and have never been disappointed. Always professional and has a smile on her face. I have even sent my teen son to see her and he asked to return! Now that in itself deserves 5 stars!
"I've given this location multiple chances to make sure it wasn't a ""one off"" ... But, when ordering. Regular size Pho - I expect more than 4 thin slices of beef!  What a joke.   The bowl was essentially all soup.   My upgrade to egg noodle meant I actually had less noodle than with the standard order rice noodle.    Plus, the bathrooms are a mess; Never any paper towels.   I give up. Not going back!"
"Very cute salon! Im very picky with color & cuts, but Shamika gets it right everytime. She's so talented & not boring!"
"It's okay, nothing fancy.  Restaurant was super clean and everyone that works there are super friendly.  I only go there when there's coupons and special promotions as their regular prices are kinda expensive for a fast food joint."
"This place is alright, it's small and dirty as are other Viet places. Nothing special, but still better than most places in the city. If you're looking for something decent priced and are in the area this would be it, but I don't suggest driving far for this place."
Stopped here for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The waiter Jene was very good and friendly. We had the Scallop Sliders which were incredible. We also had the crab and avocado salad which also was delicious. Both dishes were very fresh and cooked to perfection.
"Been here a number of times with and without grandchildren.  Located in the large shopping center at the junction of Rea Road and Audrey Kell Road.  A franchise very popular in Charlotte it is consistently good.  They keep it clean and the staffs are pretty much always on point.  Although located in a busy shopping center, this location has a pleasant fenced off dining area outside.  Not too noisy and most importantly, if you have children with you they cannot get out if they wander.  Sometimes they do slip away, so with cars continually roaming the shopping center it is reassuring that they will be safe, even if your attention slips.  I especially like the menu choices.  There are lots of them and they are creative and interesting.  I like the shrimp with hot sauce and the wild mushroom with arugula.  And the crusts are thin and charred a bit by their super hot pizza oven.  One 10"" pizza is more than enough for a meal.    Good bar with an excellent selection of beers.  Many on tap.  Prices are reasonable for drinks and pizza.  There are some other menu items, but we usually stick to the pies."
The Wynn buffet is solid with a good variety of food.  My bf was good and started off with the salad bar while I went for the fried chicken and seafood.  You just have to go for it!  It's a Las Vegas buffet at the Wynn - c'mon!  :)
"Despite the relatively bad reviews, I hesitantly decided to grab a bite to eat here after my United flight was delayed as usual.  After perusing the decently varied menu, I ordered the Prosciutto and Arugula pizza along with a 9 oz. merlot.  Honestly, I've had much better, but the pizza wasn't bad as far as airport food is concerned.  The waitress from NY was very pleasant and timely.  Yes, it was pricey but hey, it's Vegas and it's at the airport for crissakes...  Would definitely be a repeat customer if I had to wait around again."
"My boyfriend was wearing a sleeveless shirt because it's ONLY 120 degrees outside. We made the unfortunate decision to go to The Buffet at The Wynn only to be discriminated against. The European couple ahead of us the man was also wearing a sleeveless shirt however they allowed him to go in and eat. Us on the other hand were turned away. We walked away so upset we didn't even think of bringing up the couple ahead of us. It dawned on me, ""Hey! The guy in front of us was also wearing a sleeveless shirt and they went in!"" When I went back in to talk to the manager I told her what happened and rather than being the ""FIVE STAR"" place they claim to be she completely negated our point and kicked us out. DO NOT GO TO THE BUFFET AT THE WYNN! There are far better spots than this!"
"Avella took my prescription for a formulated medicine. They told me Thursday it would be delivered Monday, and I would need to sign for the delivery, so I had to be home from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. When I called Avella on Tuesday and asked why they did not deliver my prescription, Avella told me they were behind on their prescriptions since the holiday, seven days earlier. Then when I cancelled the prescription, the manager called back and offered to deliver the prescription immediately. What? How can he do that now? You mean the script is available? Why didn't anybody call while I waited five hours and tell me they would not be delivering my prescription?  Avella has a ""Cable Guy"" mindset; everybody needs their service, so customers will take precious hours out of their day to wait for Avella. The nonchalance and complete disregard for my time earns Avella zero stars.  By the way, Community Clinical Pharmacy in Mesa filled my prescription in two hours and for eight dollars less."
I was very disappointed with my stylist. I had gone in with very light blonde hair and when I left it was at least 3 shades darker.  I went in to get highlights done with some dark brown chunks. She ended up weaving the blonde and brown in my hair. So it came out darker looking.   Then a few days later I went back to get hot pink put in and she still didn't listen to what I had told her. I told her where I wanted the peekaboo's placed and she just did whatever she wanted.   I will never go back.
"We sat outside it was on the 1st floor and it was OK but not the best. Summer our waiter was very helpful, thanks Summer.  The food was good but not wow. I had fish sandwich it come with french fries. I wish they serve sweet potato fries instead of regular potatoes.  The coconut shrimps were over-cooked and it was a hard to cut according to my mother-in law.  There were few flies lingering our food during our lunch, so it was what!  The coconut cake was way to sweet for my taste.  Still don't get it, why they have the patio fire place and the torches on-on day light and it was a warm day.   The price I thought it was a bit to pricey for a regular food like that."
"I am rating this three stars because I have had my fair share of good and bad times. The drinks are usually pretty good! The trouble I have is there is always a line, there is no place to wait for your drink, and they are pretty slow. Sometimes people who came after you, get their drink first. I find that wrong. Also, they robbed me the other day. I use the app for my stars, and gift cards. I have stopped doing this now because I learned my lesson. I would never get my stars, and the cashier double charged me. Very poor staff."
"The place looks darling, goodies look delicious, but the looks are deceiving.  We bought 4 different bars and 2 cupcakes to take home and enjoy but we were extremely disappointed.  The bars were all incredibly dry and the cupcakes were also dry with hard outsides.  Everything tasted like it was at least a day or two old.  Definitely won't go back."
"Bar was good, food was ok.  I ordered a pizza and it was very dry.  Prices seemed fair for the area.  Our waitress wasn't very attentive."
"Food was good, service bad.... Nice server, but he forgot about us. We waited for an hour after we fin eating to het asked desert..."
"Extremely poor quality for its price, snow crab and cocktail shrimp tasteless and not fresh, prime rib is overcooked not favoriteful, fruits are not even there, totally unsatisfied."
"This is a good place for a quick family lunch or dinner or when hanging out with the kids at the Blakeny playground or fountain. It's a local take on the CPK concept of personal size pizza and trendy ingredients.  The service has been excellent the many times that I have been here, and the food and beer selection is decent too. The only thing where I feel they fall short is in the inconsistency of the quality of their pizza. Sometimes is really good and others is not. They seem to put the minimum amount of ingredients possible. There have been times when I can count the pepperoni slices in one hand or I will get a pizza without hardly any cheese on it."
"So I should have checked the Yelp reviews before I bought the terribly overpriced extremely bad cupcake that I bought here.    The display showed an arrangement of potentially delicious cupcakes so I bought a chocolate buttercream cupcake. It was $3.75. I gave the cashier a $20 and she gave me back $15.25.  No, she didn't do the math in her head.  She used an iPad they use for their POS system.   So I tried to unwrap the cupcake by removing the paper thingy it was cooked in and as I did I realized the outer part of the cupcake was hard as a rock. When I tried to peel the hard outer part off, the inside of the cupcake completely collapsed and it couldn't even support the icing on top. There was virtually no cupcake, just a pile of icing on top of the paper.   With the plethora of cupcakes places save your money and calories for something worthwhile and skip this place."
"This morning I decided to try a small breakfast item.  I was going to get the yogurt with blueberries, then noticed the Siggis brand vanilla yogurt. I checked the sugar content and Siggis is a third what the yogurt with blueberries is so I went with that. Good tasting and was just the amount of food I was looking for this early morning to go with my tall americano."
"It should NOT take 20 minutes to make a turkey club:  *wasn't grilled, was labeled PANINI *turkey was deli meat  Fries were generous, thick cut, not crispy and pretty greasy.    Liked my vegan wrap, light and healthy, just chuck the fries into the garbage and you get a light meal.    $26 for two meals."
"The only thing Hakkasan has to offer is good DJs. The setup is weird...and the feeling of the club is very very meh for the price. I feel like this place pretends to be 5 star, but for people who know better its an obvious sham. I cant speak of the line situation because I know the right people and usually only have girls, but Ive seen it be a nightmare and its just for the amount of money people pay it should really be a better experience. I feel like Hakkasan is all hype and the type of place vegas newbies hear about, are tricked into going to, and spend a ton of money on a meh experience.  Everytime I go to Hakkasan I want to like it but always have just an okay time, and this is even with not waiting in line, getting invited to a table, and not paying for anything. If I had to pay for it and stand in the line and then stand around afer Id be more than pissed. I dont mind divey places, but paying premium prices for a large scale dive is b.s.  As an attractive looking girl Ill get invited to a lot of tables, but usually the men are sketchy and just sort of losers...if you like high rollers Id avoid this place. The crowd usually isnt all that attractive and neither is the staff. If you want a 5 star experience I think you should stick to 5 star hotels on the strip. Hakkasan charges 5 star prices but is really ultimately not worth it. If you arent concerned with 5 star other places like Surrender are way more fun and much cheaper. Going to Hakkasan is like paying filet mignon prices and getting a Mc Donalds burger."
"There are definitely better Walgreens locations to be had. I use this one because it's close to home but really, when are they going to fix the drive thru window so they don't have to speak through the drawer? Super ghetto. You can tell it's surrounded by 55+ neighborhoods because they employees work at that same pace. None of this quick efficient workers thing. I ran in to pick up a prescription yesterday before I went to workout thinking it shouldn't take long. After calling my doctors office they finally figured out how to apply my coupon correctly. But the pharmacy tech couldn't figure out how to get the 2 for $5 on the gum I wanted to buy. Sadly this is pretty typical of this location. Don't expect much when you go here."
"overall sort of on the pricey side, years ago the  clothing was either ranch wear or  parade wear, had nice specialty items like horse hair jewelry and western themed artwork, used to steam and shape your hats and take care of any issues with the boots, overall good selection of boots, sometimes on sale, good customer service."
"The fried catfish was very good but the chicken was only satisfactory. The waffle was alright but had a strong cinnamon taste which I wasn't a fan of. The corn bread and mac and cheese were good. The atmosphere was noisy, even at 9:30 on a Thursday night."
"Do not fall for the ""free show ticket"" its an intro for hidden upgrade fees they only talk about when you go to the show! Bbbboooooo"
We have been using Manning Sprinkler Service for more than 15 years and they have never disappointed us. Family owned and run and it shows. They are very knowledgeable and can rebuild older valves if needed instead of replacing the entire valve saving money. The person that answers the phone is great and can offer alternatives to help keep the costs down if possible. Give them a try.
"Had a pho here today for lunch. Got the rare beef with well done flank. Soup was quite good, but the beef pieces, especially the well done flank was very chewy. My wife got beef vermicelli which was on point, got little jealous.  One down side of this place is they only accept cash and they got an atm at the front of the restaurant. In my opinion, restaurant not only save money on not having POS machine, but they actually make commission on these atms. Screwing customers over... Won't be returning anytime soon"
"Great buffet!  Food options were plenty as well as desserts.  The made to order potato latkes were really tasty, as well as the prime rib.  The food was cooked perfectly and the tuna poke was really good as well.  The lobster bisque was tasty, but nothing to write home about until I decided to add some of the meat from the crab legs, a little cilantro, chives, and a few shrimp to it.  Then it became amazing ;-)  I tried my first ever candy apple here and enjoyed the opportunity to try quail (at a buffet nonetheless).  Lamb was good, though my friend said hers was dry.  I would definitely return to this buffet.    The patrons were also calm as well.  Unlike the other buffet, no one seemed rushed or in a hurry or felt the need to ""load up"" their plate like others have done.  A few did, but they stuck out like sore thumbs.  Our waiter needed a bit of help keeping up with our endless pours, but he was ok. Worth the money."
"BBQ sauce was good and so were the sides. A bit of sweet and a bit of spice. Not bad at all and we will be back. The sides are a bit lacking, but, add more sauce to the beans and they're MUCH better. Try the coleslaw on the pulled pork...very nice."
"At about 12 o'clock this afternoon I was thinking to myself ""I want some pizza for lunch where should I go?""  ""Barro's!"" I screamed outloud in reply to my own question. So I borrowed $5 from my old lady and off I went.  I got the lunch special. Two slices of pepperoni pizza and a drink. I threw down the extra cash to get a side of ranch for dipping. Best decision of the day.  This location is a little far away from where I stay but it's worth the drive. Super clean place. Friendly staff. The girl at front counter is always nice. I don't know her name but she has a tattoo on the back of her neck. Thanks, neck tattoo girl! I'll be back tomorrow."
"I recently took 5 shirts into the Oxford cleaners at Riggs and McQueen.  When I went to pick them up 2 of the shirts had oil looking spots on the front and back them. These mark were not there when I dropped them off.  I asked for them to be redone.  When I went in to pick them up the second time one still had an oil like stains (on the back).  On the second shirt there were a brownish yellow streaks on the pocket and another one on the back of the shirt under one of the arm. There was also  the same type mark on the front that was more faded.  I tried to show the owners the marks first they said they said ""that's the fifth time we cleaned them and that is all we can do, we are done"".  obviously they have me mixed up with another poor customer. I advised them again that the shirts did not come in that way.  Again they said ""that is all we can do"" and went upon their business.  I advised them I would was very dissatisfied and would  not be back and the gentleman owner said "" that's what you get for $1.99, good luck with another cleaners"".  I have never witnessed such horrible, rude and unprofessional customer service, especially from owners.    Please be aware Oxford cleaners at Riggs and McQueen is not worth the risk!!!"
Everything looked amazing but we got a macaroon and it was the worst thing I've tastes . Fell apart biting but still managed to be like glue in the middle . Very disappointing
"Hidden gem. Extremely hidden. I learned some interesting facts about it but I wouldn't want to stay here during a Vegas trip again. They have essentials that a family of 3+ would need-- kitchen, room separation, large closet space, movie check outs...it's pretty cool. A nice but not so nice location on the strip. The Cosmopolitan towers over it completely. But you walk out towards the strip and you're in a prime spot.  So, not my preference. We got a free deal for this one."
"If you're a college student, and like to sleep in during FINALS WEEK, or don't want to be woken up EVERY MORNING AT 8AM by maintenance workers then DON'T LIVE HERE.  The people who clean the apartments are complete idiots and they come by your apartment 3+ times to do one job. (Mowing the lawn starts at 8. Then they come back around again and trim the trees and bushes with a chainsaw.  Then they come by again with the leaf blower to get the stuff out of your hallway.  Then they come by again with the leaf blower to finish all the piles they made.)  So after the initial noise, there is no going back to sleep after that.  I was lucky enough to live here while they were power-washing peoples A/C units.  The maintenance has a little shack by the pool where all their equipment is.  The shack has a rock area, and a grass area to do any necessary work.  They decided to drag their machines across the rocks, grass, and sidewalk to sit in the rock area at the foot of my window.  I was woken up every single day of finals week at 8AM or earlier to these guys.  I went to the office so that they could ask the people to move away from my window and do the work in another area.  I was told the work was ""mandatory"" and that I would have to deal with it.  Management has no concern for the fact that 99.9% of their tenants are COLLEGE STUDENTS and deserve certain accommodations.   The place looks like it would be a great place to live, multiple pools and jacuzzis, a gym with a tanning bed, and vending machines and a water machine.  They make all of these things look very clean around move-in time but after a month or two they go back to their extremely low standards.  During July- one of the hottest months of the year- they let the pool turn completely green. (The gate was even locked so you had literally no access to even lay out and tan.) The pool remained green for almost a month and when hey finally decided to clean it, it only took them ONE DAY to have it back to normal.. Why they waited a month to do this small amount of work is beyond me but thats 12fifty5 for ya'.  The water machine was broken for 6 months out of the year I lived there.  The vending machines were always either jammed or not working at all and would eat your money 8 out of 10 times.  The gym they had before remodeling it had great machines! (Some machines were even able to unfold or open up more so they were 2 different exercise machines folded into one.)  You could substitute a gym membership for it and still stay in great shape! There was a machine for every part of the body.  Then they bragged for weeks about this big remodel, and after being very noisy and drilling up concrete for a month straight they downgraded the gym to the point that I didn't even go.  Now they have a treadmill, a roman chair, an elliptical and machine for squatting/benching and one horribly rusty machine for sit-ups.  The sit-up machine is so worn out you cant even get it to move, the machine for squatting/benching is broken (The wires that hold the bar are broken so the machine basically does nothing) and I find treadmills and elliptical useless so the gym, to me, was entirely useless.  The tanning bed has settings anywhere from 5-20 minutes and has no instructions, no protective goggles, no sanitary wipes and no supervision what-so-ever.  Also, the apartments don't ever clean it, so if you want to use a clean bed you have to clean it yourself. (There is literally CHUNKS stuck to the glass.)  Not to mention, unless you know a lot about tanning beds, you can get burned so easily from staying in for too long.  I have never seen a tanning bed with a setting longer than 15 minutes, and having a 20 minute setting with no instructions is SO dangerous.   They tell you when you move in that they have to give you 48 hours of notice before entering your apartment, which they do.  They always post notices on your door 2 days before to let them know the day and timespan they will come.  But then they NEVER show up on the days or times listed on the paper, sometimes they would come even a week later than the dates listed on their ""48 hour notice"".  And they do checks almost once a month.  They literally have checks just to come into your apartment and look around.  (Once I had a guy come in, walk around my entire apartment, then tell me I need to make sure I take out my trash...) Management is the furthest from friendly, and the closest to brain-dead you could ever get. They can't even respond to the most simple request without giving you an attitude.  When submitting a service request, don't expect them to fix things any time soon.  And when they finally come, don't expect it to be fixed properly. After FINALLY moving out, I filled out a paper for a forwarding address.  12fifty5 never did their job--SHOCKER and my forwarding address was never recorded.  I now am missing over a months worth of mail, and when I called 12fifty5 they told me ""That's your own problem. Call the post office."""
"Great tasting food and service, but they must use preservatives or MSG because everyone in our party of 4 had an upset stomach afterwards even though we all ordered something different.  Next time I will ask about preservatives in the food."
"Upon first approaching Hakkasan, you are instantaneously in awe over the entrance.  It's massive.  So massive in fact - you can fit the entire white house + some, inside of the space  Gorgeous blue waves reflect off the elevated cement walls.  I'm not a fan of all the randomly placed steps inside the club, but most of the security guards carry flashlights to help ladies navigate in their heels (thank goodness).  This was one of the first clubs I have been to where the bouncers were actually nice - so I give them a lot of credit for that.  Just about every guest who entered the club got a sincere smile and welcoming.  The elevator staff was engaging and friendly too!    My favorite part of the club was the back room on (what I believe to be) the 4th floor - may have been third floor.  Gorgeous ferns garnish the walls with thin waterfalls separating each individual plant.  The design is gorgeous and the plants make the halls smell like you're walking through a tropical rainforest.      The main dancing floor houses the DJ booth, which is definitely highlighted as the main feature.  Wooden designs are carved throughout the walls and the ceilings.  The dancefloor was a bit small in my opinion,  reminded me of Tryst.  We walked through the entire club, stopping at almost every bar along the way.  I could see the bars being hard to get to if it's a busy night (the largest is around 30 feet in length).    The sound is probably the best quality I've heard at a club in Las Vegas.  They have a VERY impressive lineup of DJs.  Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Deadmau5, the list goes on...    I'll be looking forward to the opening of their restaurant.  I'll be back for this.  If you're considering Hakassan, I would highly recommend reserving a table.  Every table I saw in the club was good - spacious and comfortable.    If you don't end up reserving a table, their are areas that overlook the dance floor that hold miniature countertops - so if you need to rest your drink, you can.  : )  I definitely rank this club above Marquee.  If you're not into the outdoor club scenes (like Surrender or XS), Hakkasan is your best option while in Vegas.  I'm looking forward to coming back."
"You know, for it being such an upscale restaurant, I expected way better service and food. I'm really disappointed in myself for not reading these reviews before we decided to go, as it would have saved us a lot of money.   First off, I don't understand why we are asked to wait fifteen minutes when there are plenty tables that are visibly open for seating. After a half hour passed (mind you, we were the only party waiting), we had to walk back up to the host counter to bring it to their attention that we were still waiting to be seated... apparently the had forgotten about us. The best part? The host was visibly on his cell phone in front of customers-- how is this professional at all? Does he not realize that he is the first person that potential customers see?   For starters, we ordered the guacamole as the appetizer, which was kept simple and nice, although I don't think I would pay $10 for it again. Their tortilla soup was also a little too brothy for me. For being a type of restaurant with a little mexican/latino ""flavor"", you would think that a dish like this would taste a little more authentic. I really hoped the food would be all it was priced to be, but $42 for a fillet mignon A LA CARTE? Oh, and lets not forget the $13 truffle mashed potatoes that tasted like they came fresh out of a box. Is it sad to say that I've had better mashed potatoes at a cheap dive bar? Come on!   Its pretty obvious that the restaurant cares more for the presentation of the food rather than the quality. I have had way better food and service for a fraction of what we paid at this restaurant, unfortunately."
"My how much can change in 4 years. In 2010 this was a quality buffet with premium meats and such. We went back last week and the food quality has really deteriorated. Selections such as Mac n cheese, mushroom bisque, and potstickers were all very unmemorable. All dishes were overly salty. Crab legs were sub-par and served cold. Perhaps this is the norm? I've only had hot ones in the past, that were far fresher and more flavorful. At least they are sliced in half lengthwise for easy access to the meat. My companion had shrimp cocktail and didn't mention it being particularly good. I had a lot of seafood during my stay in Vegas and none of it impressed. There was a station with turkey and prime rib waiting to be carved, however, each time I walked by there was no one to be found to serve me so I can't comment on that. There was a good section of vegetables and the roasted cauliflower was delicious, albeit tragically oversalted. I steered clear of the stir fries, fearing salt poisoning after having tasted other salt-laden dishes. I didn't try any Japanese items as none looked particularly appealing. At first glance, sushi rolls seemed to be too dense in rice and lacking fillings. The Italian section with its salamis and cheeses was tempting, but when you're paying $35 a plate you don't generally rush over for cheese and crackers. I think it might make a nice starter snack though in retrospect, since none of the main dishes were stellar. Soups were salty and lacking depth. Desserts were hit or miss, with the Black Forest cake lacking cherry or dark chocolate flavors and seeming to taste mostly just ""sweet"". I avoided the dense items such as cookies and cakes and went for the blood orange panna cotta which was delightful, and the mango tapioca which also proved a winner. The tiramisu was also pretty good. Service was excellent, drinks were always kept full, Arnold Palmer's were refreshing after one too many vodka sodas at the casino. I didn't think about tipping since the receipt at the cashier when you pay has a tip line, hopefully the server gets a share of that rather than just the cashiers! I had no cash so I couldn't leave her anything additional. I definitely won't be going back to the buffet. I was also hungry a few hours later, go figure! I was a bit irked by that. I suppose nothing was good enough for me to want to gorge myself. For those with less discriminating palates and larger appetites, it might be worth the cost but certainly not for my friend and I."
it's disgusting... and the guy yelled at me cause he had supposedly waited for an 30mins. And he kept going off about that so I tipped him 5 dollars so he could shut up cause I didn't want to be mean  he couldn't have been waiting for 30 mins I ordered my food to come in at 11:55. I called the restaurant at 12:08 and the delivery guy called me at 12:09.  Wish I could give it zero stars   And I've never left reviews but I just had to for this
Best place to get a hair cut and get your beard trim!! Been going to Zero's for over 6years the staff it's wonderful Nothing but love! Next time you go ask for Mari.  She is the best!!
"Being from Cali our go to Chicken and Waffles place is Roscoe's. But Lolo's seems to be a hit out here.   Fun restaurant with good service and cute decor. Food wise, the waffle at Roscoe's is better. The waffle here was a little more doughy and not as flavorful. Chicken here is better though, crispy on the outside moist inside and flavorful but not salty. The ""dranks"" here are crazy sweet, I asked for a cup to pour out half my sweet tea and diluted it with half a glass of water lol. Same goes for the lemonade. The grits, mac and cheese and cornbread are yummy. Would love to come back and try some more side dishes!"
"My fiancé and I ate at Tommy Bahamas with his boss from out of town on Wednesday! This was our first time dining here and I was super excited because I love the way the restaurant looks from the outside. It's beautiful.   Our server was very friendly and nice. She gave us a lot of time to decide what we wanted because we were those people who talk more before ordering our meal. I ordered the sangria which was delicious.   I was contemplating two dishes, a pasta dish with mushrooms and shrimp or crab stuffed shrimp. My server recommended the pasta and she was so right! It was the best pasta dish I ever had out to dinner. My boyfriend had shrimp and scallops and that too was delicious.   I loved the butter with the rolls and I truly enjoyed my evening and meal. I like this place because it is a little pricey but nothing to break the bank. You and a special friend can walk out of there paying less than $100 and get a quality meal.   I recommend this gem to any foodie in AZ! :)"
"A family member was showing off her new cowboy boots. I liked the looks of them on her so I asked where they came from. When she told me, I took a ride down the road to the Clipity Clop, but sadly discovered few boot options for me. The prices were also steep, but the quality seemed solid. Then again, I also couldn't get anyone to help me even though the place was pretty empty. Overall, it seemed the store was well inventoried for equestrians rather than regular guys like me just interested in boots."
"Had lunch there today, 40 min wait but then they offered up the patio right away. Wasn't too unbearable with the misters.   Got our dranks quickly, however due to me ordering a cheeseburger the food delivery took about 40 minutes.  Food was good, not to die for though. Won't order the Mac and cheese again.  Wife ordered chicken and waffle.  Said was good, likes the thin waffles.   Ordered the red velvet cake for myself, not impressed. Maybe it wasn't made recently, very dry. Definitely not as good as Grandma made it.  We'd probably go back again, but not right away."

"Two stars is generous considering what was delivered tonight. I have had worse, but not often. The food was sub-standard by any evaluation, and almost an hour late to boot. The Kung Pao shrimp was wimpy. Likewise the Chicken in Garlic Sauce, contaminated with green bell peppers that we specifically requested be omitted. Seldom have I tasted blander Chinese food. The cook on duty tonight was simply incompetent.  Supposedly they're ""under new management."" This is probably a BAD thing.  To be fair, I grew up with very good Hunan & Yunan style Chinese food. I am spoiled. I do know the differences among good, mediocre, and lousy. To call this mediocre is generous."
The best buffet ever! A long line but well worth it. My husband and I have been here twice for brunch. $42 per person. I would NOT bring anyone under age 15 here. They will  pretty much end up only eating bacon and not enjoying the real variety. I say this because both times that is what I have seen.
"I have been here many times, the cleaning they do is alright nothing to complain about. But what is giving this place a two stars is the service. Normally I come in and they write my name down and I pick up my clothes in a couple days no big deal, but the past few times I have been here the person working at front can never find my orders. I sent my husband over there a few days ago and they couldn't find our order, so my husband leaves and I call the store within 5 minutes. The lady was very sweet and nice and she sat there for a few minutes looking on the computer. Finally she finds an order under a completely different name. She described the clothes to me and that was my order! I was so relieved that she found them. I don't know what the deal is but some of the workers only ask for a name and they write it down on a paper and leave it in the counter and I leave. Other times I have gone in and another (completely different )worker would look up my name and confirm it and then send me on my way."
"We had tickets for LeReve so thought this would be a nice option before the show.  Indeed, it was.... I was a little nervous about getting there early to avoid a line, we got there around 6:30 on a Tuesday night and had a short line ahead of us, nothing horrible.  The buffett was fabulous...LOTS to choose from from salads, to asian, to middle eastern food, to pizza (which was REALLY good) and shell fish, which I'm allergic to but my mom said the crab legs were to die for...they're already cut open and ready to eat. Definitely save room for dessert as there are many to choose from after dinner.  The line was getting long when we left so definitely hit up this buffett early on to avoid the rush"
"I went here for breakfast with some friends, and I don't remember much about it -- just that I didn't enjoy it very much. I do remember that the breakfast menu was pretty limited. Also that everything was pretty flavorless.   Maybe I would try it again for lunch, as that seems to be their strong point."
"I had lunch here with my parents recently.  They had been there previously and liked it but my mom was disappointed with our most recent visit.  It was my first visit and I thought it was ok, but not great, and with so many restaurant choices in Toronto, I likely wouldn't come back.  So we sat down and they promptly gave us a pot of tea and 3 tea cups along with the menus.  Unfortunately, one of the cups had a piece of rice or something white and sticky on the rim, so we asked them for another cup.  They took away the cup and brought us another one.  Not exactly an auspicious start, but at least they remedied the situation.    I got the H02 - House Special Clear Noodle Soup ($8.25).  My parents both got the P01 - House Special Pho.  My mom got a small ($7) and my dad got a large ($9).  I love clear noodles (aka tapioca noodles) and the ones in my soup were ok, but not as chewy as I like them.  My soup was full of miscellaneous items.  I had a quail egg (tasted canned), a wonton (lots of shrimp and pork filling, I wished there was more than just 1), a shrimp (a good size, but not completely de-veined), 2 pieces of squid (tasted rubbery), a piece of BBQ pork (good flavour and not too fatty), 2 pieces of thinly sliced liver (I don't usually like liver, but this was ok), 2 pieces of thinly sliced heart (I gave this to my dad because other than liver I don't eat organ meats), and a fried fish ball sliced in two (tasted good).  The broth was a chicken broth and tasted ok.  It wasn't overly salty or fatty.  The soup also came with a shrimp cake on the side, which is a shrimp still in the shell with the head still on it on a deep fried pancake.  I gave this to my mom because food that still has the head on it freaks me out.  She said the shrimp tasted soft and mushy and not fresh and the pancake was greasy.      My mom didn't like her pho. She said the noodles tasted sour like it was from an old batch or something.  However, my dad liked his pho and said the broth was delicious and had that true authentic pho taste.  He would return.  My mom and I would not.  Service is not the friendliest but acceptable.  There's lots of free parking in front of the restaurant."
"This place always came up when talking to people about where to go for lunch, so my expectations were high when we headed to the Wynn.  We got in a couple of minutes before lunch prices kicked in, so we got the cheaper breakfast rate, which was a plus.  The place is probably good compared to other buffets, but really why even go to one in the first place. None of the dished were very good. The pizza was bland, the ceviche fairly uninteresting, the kobe beef sliders disappointing. Sure, the roast beef was ok and there was a lot of food, but honestly if I had made any of those dishes at home, I would have been disappointed about the outcome, and I would definitely never serve it to someone else.  Save your money and go to a real restaurant."
"I didn't end up eating since the reviews were so bad. My IPA was huge and just what I needed. It was $13 plus tip so a little over the top but I was in an airport, so not too surprised (The wine list had prices, the beers did not. That was kinda bad juju.)  My waitress was fantastic even with them being slammed."
"I love this place!!! The environment is welcoming, calm and relaxing.  All the people who work here are friendly and it is very clean.  I go here to visit Cassandra for everything!  Hair color, cuts, waxes,  and styles for any event.  not only do I trust her with my own hair. But I also take my daughter , who has very very curly hair.  Cassandra has been the only person I've gone to for the past 15 years. My mother sister and her fam all go to her as well. We know we can walk out looking great Without a doubt. Highly recommended."
The Buffet @ Wynn really really disappointed me...  So much anticipation was built from having good luck on the slots prior to waiting in the 1 hour line.  They had cheese and crackers that were taking up space!   Their sushi station had 3 kinds of cut rolls that I didn't even go near.  The only section worth exploring was the desserts.   My new theory on buffets: Just because the hotel is nice doesn't mean their buffet is good.
"Worst pharmacy service in the entire state of Arizona, the store and staff absolutely wonderful and pleasant.  The pharmacy staff is rude and completely unprofessional."
"Solid steakhouse, slightly dull ambiance.  I had the classic steakhouse meal: some mildly-genteel Cabernet, Caesar salad, petite Filet and baked potato. The baked potato is GINORMOUS, so I shared with my date -- and it was plentyfor each of us (and I have what's politely called a ""healthy"" appetite).  Everything was great. The Caesar wasn't fishy, the steak was fabulous, and the potato was...a potato (pretty hard to f*ck THAT up!). Prices were as expected: my date ordered the exact same thing as I did, but with a second glass of wine, and the total bill was around $170.    Since steak is steak, let's talk atmo: is there anything that sets this apart from every other steakhouse in Vegas? Well, it's SOLIDLY unpretentious, which earns it big points in my book....but the ambiance is kinda dull. Dim lighting, boring furniture, and not much in the way of decor aside from giant black-and-white photos of past stars who have performed at the hotel. The one over our table was of Miss Ann-Margret...but was mislabeled as ""Charo"" (!!!!!!).   Overall: if you're staying at the LVH, this place is fine. But I wouldn't call it a destination steakhouse."
"This is a relatively new club in Vegas that opened with great fanfare.  I still find the club scene in Vegas to be simply crazy - I'm not sure why, but here the concept of money/value isn't something people think of at all.  The whole ""bottle service"" concept is a complete rip-off and yields massive profits for the clubs.  On the night we went, prime tables for DeadMau5 were going for $4k - that is simply insane.  Back to Hakkasan: My biggest problem with this club is the layout - each level has an odd layout.  Just finding your way around can be a challenge.  The DJ's were great (DeadMau5 was amazing - you need to check him out anywhere he plays) and I found the service by all of the staff to be very good - the security were not arrogant pricks.    There is tons of club competition in Vegas and MGM is spending a fortune to lock up high-end DJ talent in the city.  Given the layout of the club however, I'm not sure that bet will pay off for them."
This is our favorite pizza and the Best Barros in the Valley. There all good but this one tops them all. They make you feel like family! Every employee there is fantastic and especially Demetria! We recommend Barros if your a pizza lover.
"Who wants to ruin a rare date night by sending the food back?  So with brave smiles we fought our way through our meals and tried to focus on the positives:  The perfect table that the nice greeter sat us at , The friendly and solicitous server, The great crab bisque, The perfectly cooked sea bass.  But really, how hard does one have to work to make pork ribs tasteless?  And who in the world thought it would be a good idea to comprise half the ribs' side dish with raw red onions?  For the life of me, I couldn't tell what that side was supposed to be.  The sea bass special that was supposed to have this delicate horseradish sauce turned out to be oversauced with something better described as gloppy than delicate.  Its flavors clashed with the sea bass, as did the mashed potatoes...though the three did make a nice white monochrome statement on my plate.  The accompanying baby bok choy was overcooked/mushy.  We were so disappointed (disappointed doesn't describe how my stomach felt all night) that it ruined date night anyway, so we should have spoken up."
I had 2 dresses that I needed to be pressed for a wedding the next day. No other cleaner in the area could accommodate that request. When I called Oxford I ended up speaking with the gentlemen that actually does the work and he was extremely nice and said he could for sure get them done. I dropped them off to him on Friday at 1:00 and they were ready for pick up Saturday at 10am. I was very happy and the dresses both looked beautiful.
"I am incredibly disappointed in the business ethic of Blush Salon. My husband bought me a promotional gift certificate in February as a Valentine's gift, with the dates of use saying 2/2016 until 7/2016. This implies I have until the end of July to use the gift certificate, however, when I called to book an appointment for a facial the last week of June, the lady on the form informed me they were all booked for the rest of the month and that the gift certificate expired on July 1st. I questioned her on it, because the terms on the back of the gift certificate clearly state that it must be used WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF PURCHASE. She said that she would have the owner call me back so I could discuss it being honored through the end of July as it should be according to the terms. I didn't get a call back, so I tried again and left another message. I still didn't hear back, so I messaged the company on Facebook and someone responded that they couldn't honor it past July 1st because the promotion started in January. I responded back that it clearly says six months from purchase, not six months from the beginning of the promotion, but again, I never heard back. My understanding was that these certificates were a way to draw in clientele and give them such a fabulous experience, they will become return business. However, this has made me very aware of what an unethical establishment this salon is, and I hope that I will be able to save someone in the future from buying a gift certificate from there or honoring them with their business at all."
"While food & service was good, the noise level was unbelievable. The reason being that it was a ""game"" night. So unless you are in the mood for a pre-game scrum, I would suggest you keep your visit to another time."
The buns were bought from a place like costco. The fixin bar was limited. The tomato was cold and therefore had no flavor. The meat tasted good.
"Pho gets better the more you eat it but it remains a not very good one, although meat portion sizes are good. Other meals are not fabulous."
"Came here for a late lunch and just got some poutine, which was pretty decent. Service was okay at the bar and prices were reasonable. Might be better during a Habs game or something."
"Not to hard to write a good review for these guys. It was a straight forward move. Showed them what needed to be moved from which rooms around the house and outside. No complaining, no breaks (even though it was hot and humid and told them to take a few minutes!) Hard working and very respectful. About $300 for everything and took about 2 hours."
"I am not a nightclub kind of a girl. Admittedly, I am not one of ""the beautiful people"" who feels comfortable sporting a dress with my back end practically exposed...I AM a dancer, but I really don't know how to ""club"" dance.   The last time I went to a club, was about six years ago, and I hated it.  This Friday night, a friend of mine invited me out with a big group to Hakkasan, saying that they could get me in for free.    I decided to give it a go, and not be a party pooper...just because I didn't like it 6 years ago, doesn't mean I won't like it now.  We arrived, and there was a SWARM of people waiting to get in. The friend who had the ""hookup"" went and talked to security, and apparently it wasn't completely free..to get 4 people in, it ended up costing $160.  The friend took care of it, and told us not to worry about paying her back, which...to be honest...I wouldn't have gone in had I known that she had covered THAT much money for us.  I'm sorry, but I'm not used to having to pay a cover when I want to go and dance, let alone pay $40 a person.    So...strike one, too expensive to get in.  The place itself is beautiful.  They have candles and incense lining the halls.  Its two stories, so if you don't want to get caught up in the madness that is the dance floor downstairs, you can go upstairs, where its not quite AS busy.  The music was great.  Above and Beyond was playing that night...we actually didn't stay for them, but whoever the DJ was before them, was excellent.  I enjoy EDM and Electronica, even though I'm not super skilled at dancing to that kind of music.  The dancefloor was jam packed.  Uncomfortably so for me.  I have a tendency to be a bit introverted, and claustrophobic at times...so next time, I'll either bring money to drink so I don't care, or I'll stay upstairs and dance there.    It was a great experience, but let me tell you, don't go to this place without PLENTY of money for alcohol if you're going to drink.  We got a vodka cranberry for $16.  That's a bit extreme, even for being downtown...  I liked it.  I'd like to go back, but only for musicians that I really know and like...if Krewella plays there I'll be back for sure....in the meantime, I'm going to put some money aside for drinks for when I do go.  ;)"
"Big disappointment.  I was expecting quality food.  The food was average.  Variety is not.  Service was bad.  Even the dessert did not taste good for us.  Price was very expensive.  I would have rather gone to Golden Corral (a bit exaggerated but given difference in prices, I would)."
"Wow. The three stars is for the food and well I won't dare judge the entire staff on ONE BAD SHEEP aka ""Doris."" The food is pretty good but I only took a few bites because the lady at the registered messed my order up. When the sweet, sweet cook brought up my order and explained that she can whip me up another bowl because its not correct the cashier yells turns to us and shouts ""let her take it, let her take it."" It's not just about me but about other customers who instead of being welcomed with warm energy have to deal with a lady who has a huge attitude. Listen you old hag, (kidding, kidding, LOL...I'm totally not mad LOL so allow me to find humor in the situation). I'm not going to get punked into your poor customer service skills... She needs another job. Perhaps she angry because she's having a rough/long day... Whatever is going on in her life's reflecting through her work and energy for sure. HOWEVER Gerald the manager who also owns my favorite place next door (Carolina BBQ) is a total sweetheart and he showed us southern hospitality, he gave me a full refund and discount on food from his other joint which I fell in love with at first bite!   Try the food. Pray to God you get someone else to take your order and say Hi to Gerald and let him know what a fabulous job he's doing! I'm sure enough to say this is a 4-5 STAR place if not for the one wrong decision made in the hiring process."
"Great place to come if you need to feel like you're on a vacation. Great location, excellent service and decor is island stylin'. The food is good and the drinks are even better. I highly recommend the key lime pie martini and coconut creme. They are even like a dessert drink.  Ordered the scallops as an appetizer hoping they were the real winner, but they were just okay. Craving a filet mignon, I ordered as well hoping to have the best lunch and that also was just okay!! The sauce that was lathered on wasn't my favorite.   Tommy Bahama's has a great vibe going, but I would probably come back just for happy hour."
"We almost skipped this place because we got a little sick of having buffet. Glad that we did not. The food is excellent. I love the dessert, the veal spareribs, kobe meatloaf, the asian food including their noodle soup. My hunny loves the lamb, he had 3 portions of the lambs."
"We mostly eat here out of convenience cause its right by home. but sincerely there's nothing special happening with this pizza. average tasting. prices are obviously cheap. And the actual restaurant smells bad when i enter - we just phone order and pick up. salad bar spread always appears unappetizing, old lettuce and such. I guess it's true what they say; ""you get what you pay for""???"
"This was our 4th trip to the restaurant and if I would have written this review after the 3rd trip, I would have given it 5 stars.  Needless to say, the food was spectacular as it had been the last 3 times we had been there.  I gave it 3 stars on this review due to the poor service.  We waited at least 10 minutes to have a server come to our table after we were seated with no apologies for the wait and that was after I went back to the hostess stand to ask where our server was.  She had indicated he was at the bar getting drinks....10 minutes!  Really!  Asked our server about the ""Foodie Friday"" special and he did not seem to know what I was talking about but finally the light bulb went on and he said he had to check on it.  Waited a long time for our drinks to come out and another long wait for the food.  I will state again that the food has always been excellent and it was this time as well.  We ordered a slice of their Pina Colada cake to go and that took another 10 minutes.  I had already paid the check and we were just sitting there waiting for the cake to go box to come.  Poor, poor service and top that off with a waiter who seemed to be clueless and lacking in any sense of urgency....not a good combination.  I will go back and will actually ask to speak to the manager on our next visit.  Can't say enough about the quality of the food and that is the reason we will give it another shot."
I expected more from this buffet!! We came to the Wynn to watch the show Le reve and thought we could get our tummies full at the Buffett! I saw that they had oysters but I was very disappointed when it was outer rockafeller! I thought it would be fresh oysters! I've been the Caesars palace buffet and that place was amazing!!!!! The food there was super delicious and great quality!!  This was okay.. The sushi was lame and the food was bland... They had great decor bit that was about it.../ if you want good buffet go to the Caesars buchannal buffet. This place is kind of a waste
"We went here for Mothers Day and experienced a very disorganized manager and staff. After being called by the restaurant to make sure we arrived on time or you would lose your table, we made sure we came early only to wait another 45 min for a table to be ready. The manager seemed to not care about this long wait and was somewhat condescending in his responses to us. I have dined here many times and it has been great, but the general manager is not very good."
Waited FAR too long in line. Was not greeted by ANY of the 5 or 6 associates in the banking center. Walked out and took my transaction to another banking center and was treated the way I should be.
"The Big Pretzel Panini consisted of grilled chicken, provolone, bacon, lettuce and tomato served on a pretzel bread roll.  It was served with fries and a pickle wedge.  It sounded great on the menu and in all honesty, it was ok---  not memorable--just ok.  Our waitress was sweet and took good care of us throughout our short stay.   I think we were in and out in half an hour.  It took about 10 minutes for the food to arrive at this airport establishment.  We also shared their margherita thin crust pizza.  Again, it was ok. They don't have any grated cheese if you wanted to sprinkle some on your slices like we did.......  I think we paid $27.00."
"I went for Sunday Brunch and they were out of Champagne!!! Unbelievable!!  But luckily the food was pretty good!  The highlights had to be the freshly prepared omlettes and the  prime rib.  It had a good selection of foods.  The deserts looked amazing but they kinda tasted all the same and a bit bland.  The coffee was good, very strong.    The highlight was sitting in the Atrium though, definitely the best looking buffet in vegas.  The atmosphere was great!"
"I eat here every time I stay at the Wynn/Encore.  Mainly because my stay always comes with a comp and I play enough to get a line pass.  The best part about this buffet is the dessert selection.  Not only do they have literally dozens of bit size selections, but you can get made to order sundaes and ice cream cones.  The atmosphere is gorgeous.  The general selection of food is basically what you find at every buffet in Vegas now.  A station from every part of the world, with nothing really standing out as a specialty or a must try."
"Absolutely gorgeous store, which is what attracted me to walk in with my three year old. Everything is extremely overpriced. Bought a cupcake. Let me 2&3 year old share it. Took a couple bites each and no longer wanted it. Definitely odd.  Probably won't be back due to the high prices."
"HORRIBLE experience! My sister took me and my girlfriends here for MY BACHELORETTE party. We came early and the line was out the door. So we went to ask someone at the front if we'll still be able to go in for free and the guy said yeah as long as you're in line by 10:00pm, you'll be fine. So we happily went BACK in the long a$$ line! We were in line for 4 HOURS IN OUR HEELS!!!... thinking that we should still be able to get in. Note that by this time (2:00am) people were already leaving the lines. We stayed since it was my bachelorette party. By the time we got to the line, they told us that we had to pay. We told them what the guy told us, but then they started shooing us outside yelling REPEATEDLY ""THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY, LEAVE"". I've never been so embarrassed and disrespected in my life! We had a large group of girls and we certainly will never be going there again."
"this club was doomed from the start. 5 level club they said! hottest club in vegas they said! the only thing hot about this club is the actual room temperature. so many people packed into 2 floors, you actually sweat just standing there. save your time and money for the day clubs."
"Will never be back or recommend. The previous visits were sketchy (they will tell you their over priced and obviously sponsored food is a necessity for your animal to survive and magically fix whatever is ailing your animal only to do absolutely nothing) the last one was the straw that broke the camels back. I was told that my dog needed to be kept for the day to have treatment done, and was given a paper copy of a ""lowest quote"" and the ""highest quote"". I signed for that and when I came in to pick her up, I was given a bill that was three hundred dollars over the original ""highest quote"" that I signed for. This place is a beautiful facility and now I know why - it's paid for on the backs of pet owners. I do not appreciate dishonest medical practice and I will not be back.   Also, spare me a patronizing ""we are so sorry for the confusion"" response. After doing research outside of your own braggadocios bs, I've learned that there are more than multiple animal hospitals surrounding you that are a fraction of what you charge."
"We eat a lot of pho. It's basically our go to for everything. Don't know how it happened, but that comforting soup noodle, with the intense beefy flavour is something that I just can't enough of sometimes. For me, it's actually all about the texture of the rice noodle and complexity in flavour of the broth. I don't even have to have the protein that is ubiquitous with the dish.  In this context, Golden Turtle has hit all the standard notes for pho. It doesn't stand out, though it does rank in the top half for me.  The deep fried spring roll was very well done as well. A bit too oily, but I guess that's where a lot of the deliciousness came from.  The patio - rare for a pho place though not out of the ordinary for this neighbourhood - was packed. The service was quick. All in all, for a cheaper for fix in this neighbourhood, I would come again."
"High quality items, and excellent western boot selection. Very limited as far as the male English riding equestrian is concerned (this is typical of most stores, and annoying for male English riders). Inventory of English riding tack (particularly bridles and martingales) could be better."
OMG!!! this place is horrible do not ever i repeat EVER!!! order from here...reason::: i ordered sesame chicken and pork fried rice i might has well have went to Fry's up the street and got it frozen and cooked it myself really Canton the economy is bad but C'mon now you can atleast import it from china
"This place has so many pros and cons, it's insane.  I'll try and make this short and to the point. If you are looking for a cheap place that still has some comforts of home, such as a kitchen in a hotel that you don't plan on really spending any time in while you are in Las Vegas. You have found your place. It's location is quite amazing.  If you're looking for a hotel that you want to spend time in and just have a lazy, relaxing, and rejuvenating stay, find somewhere else... anywhere else. Everything about the inside of the hotel and even the rooms to some extent are a mood killer."
"This buffet was a little on the pricey side, for 2 people for the dinner buffet was $55 on a weekday.  There wasn't as many choices as I thought there would be.    Though my bf did like the crab legs, so I guess if you're into that then come here.  The strawberry cake was good.    But if you want a good buffet with more selections for a decent price you should go elsewhere."
"I think I would have given this buffet 5 stars if they didn't raise the price for Memorial Day. Brunch/Lunch price was about $45/pp which is fairly outrageous, even with the food being so good.  Beautiful floral decor throughout. Great service for removing dishes & refilling drinks. Fabulous presentation of food, especially the dishes in individual containers, and such variety. Desserts----so many options---spectacular and delicious."
"As a local, I have tried many buffets.  It was okay. Buffet is small and limited selection vs other grander buffets in the city.  I didn't feel it was worth the price.  While Wynn is exceptionally beautiful, I was surprised to see the limited selection and size at Wynn. Will need to expand to attract more people."
"Oftentimes when I visit this particular location, they are always out of something. Coffee is almost always cold. Terrible service by the careless owner.  Go elsewhere."
"nice set-up, great dj line-up. gotta love the EDM! I will give the club props for that...the hip hop room is irrelevant. LOL... anyways, but if you are a dude, then you need to get bottle service!! otherwise you will be stuck wandering around like a worthless chump. way too many steps, very dark lighting, not good for drunk people. and when it gets packed, its like a rat maze.. good luck trying to walk thru the main dance floor!"
"I don't recommend taking your business here. About TWO MONTHS ago I brought in a dress to be dry cleaned, expecting it to be ready in a few days. However, I did NOT anticipate in finding out my dress was somehow LOST and was given to he wrong customer. At that point, I was a little distraught, but I figured it would eventually be found, because how does someone lose a customer's belongings that they are essentially trusted with. However, the communication I experienced w this business was horrific. The only person who knew what was going on was the manager, who was only available for two hours in the early morning on weekdays. They were not apologetic and didn't seem to care. It would be until after Thanksgiving that they would tell me that the dress is lost and instead of giving a full refund of the dress that cost $60, they would only give me $30. This was disappointing to here, since I was essentially led on by this business to believe that my dress was recoverable. There are plenty of nearby dry cleaning places that truly care about their customers, and will actually return your clothing. That is not what I want to worry about every time I go to a dry cleaning business, the possibility of never seeing my belongings again and the feeling of being cheated."
My first time eating take out from this place I'm not sure if maybe the food would of been better eating in. I was really in the mood for ceviche for some reason . For the people who know me I hardly ever crave mexican food and on a even rarer occasion I actually eat it from a restaurant for this reason I'm always disappointed! I feel like the ceviche was such a let down  it had absolutely no flavor it was simply a mixture of shrimp and a bunch of onions with squid . I did get three limes on the side and tapatio packets wich I loaded the toastas with wich by the way we're all broken. I also order a tinga sope wich was a load of oil there was so much freeze that one bite was enough for me . The camarones en mojo were spicy as hell im not sure if they mixed my order but my bf can't eat spicy so his dinner was a waste . I think for 50$ worth of food it was a complete waste /: even the guacamole was flavorless idk how you mess that up. Sorry but the only reason they got three stars was because they delivered it pretty quick .
This is NOT your High School Spanish Class!  Martha's classes make learning Spanish fun and exciting.  I have enjoyed taking her class so much that I look forward to when my son is school age and can take classes with her as well.
"I should have known better. Or at least expected less. Pork was extremely bland and hush puppies were so dense they were barely cooked. Mac-n-cheese, however, was decent enough."
"5 stars for Pho, 3 stars for everything else.  If you already have a fave Vietnamese place, don't stray too far off the Pho menu here, because it can be a bit disappointing."
"This review is for the dinner buffet. Awful. I've eaten at so many wonderful Vegas buffets (Mirage, Paris, Rio, etc.) and this is NOT one of them. Apart from being one of the most expensive buffets I've been to, the food was bland and lifeless. There was not one memorable dish."
"I like a good brick oven pizza and this place doesn't disappoint. Wait staff is fast and courteous. On the downside, the food took an abnormally long time - 30-40 minutes for a simple pizza."
If you want cheap dont go...BUT if you want GREAT food...go!!!! ALaskan king crab legs....Some of the best sea bass I have ever had. I will making this a regular vegas stop!
"If I could give zero stars, I would. Nasty food. Sticky gross tables and floor... Horrible attitude from owners and cashier. Disgusting moldy drink machine. Horrible experience."
"As far as Airport cuisine, this place wasn't bad. I got the chicken with stir-fried rice and aside from being $10+ and portioned on the smaller side, the flavors were balanced and the dish was well done. Nothing in particular about the food here stands out, but it filled a void in my belly.   Worthy of noting, if I wasn't starving my money would be way better spent at just about any chinese take out joint, but being in an airport the value ilfor your buck is to be expected. Kind of like popcorn at the movies I suppose! In my honest opinion, the dish I ordered should have been about $6 and not $10+ so for that I give this place a weak three stars."
"SO MANY BUGS! I have lived here for almost a month now and I see at least 5 roaches a day. It is disgusting!   I have told the office multiple times and the exterminator just comes in a sprays, they never actually try to stop the problem!  I am disgusted at how many bugs get in my food and then they are bad now, because roaches are filthy!  Rent is cheap, but I would rather spend more to not live with bugs every day...  When we moved in, the carpets were slightly cleaned, there were dead bugs in the cabinets in the kitchen...  The rod in the shower was broken, it looked like they didn't even clean before we moved in, the bath was black, the fridge had old stains, the oven had stuff in the drawer still from the previous owners, its disgusting, no wonder there are so many bugs here.  The pools are nice and big, often way cooler than you expect...  Lots of international students here...  I will be moving out by the end of the lease, this place is just Crap"
Arrogant and extremely rude staff. Overpriced drinks and recorded music. Same set all nights. Don't waste you time and money here.
"I have been here before and loved it. I came back with my significant other and we were kind of dissapointed. The service was pretty slow. After everything we ordered and asked for, the waiter asked us if we were sure and we were mildly annoyed by that. Yes, we are sure we want a to-go-box! I had the pad thai with shrimp, which was very good. My cocktail (top of the list, starts with a C...) was also delicious. I wish they still had the grilled lamb belly salad :-( My BF had the Prime Vig Dip, which was very dissapointing and dry. Besides my boyfriend's food, my only real complaint is that they take the food to box it. I had so much left that I was planning on having it for lunch the next day. When I opened it at home, there was barely anything left.  I wonder if it accidentally got tossed and then saved... but that's only an assumption. Overall, it's a nice location for hanging out. We did not hate it but also weren't impressed and will most likely not come back."
Place was decent but the margaritas were too sweet and the salsa wasn't that great. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were not good at all but the tamale was. Don't get the green sauce it's very bitter and ruined the tamale. This place is better than macayos though.
The cupcake was dry but the frosting was tasty.  The oreo brownie was very dense and hard to bite. The best tasting item we had was the blueberry and peach bar. Most likely we would not visit this establishment again. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.
"under new management, wouldnt recommend, prices went up and service went down"
"I lived here for a year and it was bad. First, we didn't even get the apt we were promised, they told us they would upgrade an apt for us while we live in another apt for a month. When we came back to move into the new place, no one knew what we were talking about.  My roommate and I lived in a 2bedroom 2bathroom apt, and she had the master suite and was out of town when my toilet broke. When I told the office my toilet broke, they said I was a low priority because we had two bathrooms. The problem was my roommate's door was lock so I couldn't go in there, after about almost a week I was finally able to use my own bathroom again.  Those are my two biggest issues with this complex."
"I have lived here for almost 2 years now and I love it here! I don't know what all the bad reviews are about, I haven't had any issues with pests or management. When we first moved in and my roommate saw a bug we notified the office and it was taken care of right away! The property manager, Leeanne, and the rest of her team are super amazing and very understanding."
Awesome location and Johnny was a saint....... sadly the rest of the staff must have been in a horrible funk. DO NOT waste your hard earned money with these people. I sincerely hope my family reconsiders selling this property based on the attitude displayed during my business trip. UNBELIEVABLE!
"This is a really pretty shop but they might not be getting the traffic they need to sustain the business. I don't mind the prices- large slice of cake for $8.75 but I do mind it if the cake is dry. We had the mint chocolate cake and unfortunately when the cake is dry, the only thing that comes to mind is that the baker is a novice. Use some cake syrup to keep the cake moist! Especially if the cakes stay for a few days, it's not worth my time. Maybe the cupcakes or brownies are better. It's too bad since having a good cake shop would have been great."
"I have been here multiple times and every time the people were rude to me. They did not seem to care about me or my personal needs. The cupcakes were hard and not worth my money. The prices are way too high, I could make better cupcakes at home and for way cheaper. I will definitely not be going back."
"Prices are somewhat high for the quality of the place. They also have a really weird annoying gate issue where certain gates are by code, another is open most of the time but sometimes it's early or later than the usual time, the other gate is exit only. Come up with a system and stick to it! The office ladies are not particularly helpful or cheerful. They are just there and usually have a dumb excuse for whatever your complaint was. I had a bike stolen and my car messed with in the parking lot. I've seen other bikes stolen from here also. Maintenance guys are nice and pretty efficient. My apartment is the upgraded option and we still need a new dishwasher and the carpet had a big stain upon move in- that was noted on the walk through. All amenities that are located in the office area are only available during office hours- tanning, computer and printing area, laundry card machine and bathrooms. The gym is open if you rent a key to get in for $25. The game room also needs that rented key and you have to get the pool balls from the office. No couch to watch tv in game room. Pretty good location for ASU and light rail. The neighbors are all mostly super weird. Not your typical college complex. It's a half step above my last crappy apartment."
Terrible for vegetarians. Deserts are good . Too expensive for the quality of food served .
"This is one of the best club I'd ever been in. The place is incredible, nice, good drink. Lovely people, or... ""very hot girls :)"" and great DJs. They used to have performers such as Calvin Harris, Nervo and Tiësto. When I was there, Calvin Harris did the hard work! I recommend to all my friends that want to spend some time in Las Vegas and passing by MGM, jump to that club."
Escape to a tropical oasis! Food is always great! Service and staff are excellent!
"I tried to order to go from this place. The phone rang and rang and rang, when someone finally did pick up they put me on hold until the line disconnected. I called back and had the exact same thing happen. We figured they were just busy and decided to drive there to get to go. There was only ONE car in the parking lot. And the place looked like a total dump, like cockroaches in the kitchen dump.   Forget this place. There is no excuse for not taking a phone order when there is no one in your restaurant."
"Super nice setting.   Varied selection.    I expected more-the Mexican food selection was not appetizing,  only four different sushi rolls-no sashimi!...Overpriced for dinner.   I would opt for a steak dinner at a nice restaurant in town next time."
"The weather was nice out, and after having lunch at Pieology, my SO and I decided to take a walk. While enjoying the crisp air and gorgeous sunshine, we decided some baked treats wouldn't hurt...  The first thing that came to mind when I entered Wonderland Bakery was, ""It's like Pinterest exploded in here!"" There are so many darned cute little knick knacks: pre-made gift baskets, baked goods, and even a working toy train up above.  There are plenty of treats! Cookies, cupcakes, macarons, brownies, and cake pops. After grabbing hold of someone's attention, we ended up with a lemon bar and a chocolate cupcake with raspberry frosting.  Here's the verdict: There was a little too much frosting, but it was good frosting! The cupcake itself was mediocre, and we decided that the lemon bar was the better choice of the two. It wasn't too sour, and the consistency was pretty good.  In other reviews, people weren't too fond of the price, but that range was expected considering its location. Overall, I'd consider coming back to try something else."
Hi so I had my cake picked up for my boyfriends birthday and I was very unpleased with it. I payed over 100 dollars for a cake and 80 dollars for 10cookies. If I'm going to spend that type of money I expect it to be done better then what I received. The sheet for the logo didn't even go across the whole top like I was promised. It looks like it was just slapped on top and when it didn't fit across you guys added black frosting to make it blend but it clearly didn't. I felt like mabye they didn't seem to care since I had already payed upfront. Here is a picture of what I picked up and it wasn't even centered.
So disappointed by the Miscellaneous Barn in Painesville. Quoted a price one day. Four days later want $220 more. Won't budge. They instead offered slightly discounted delivery.   They find good furniture but charge a hefty price for it.
Easiest move! Competitive quote AND no hidden fees. Efficient workers! I highly recommend this company and will use again! Thanks Dignity.
It was alright.  Quick preparation. Above average taste however over priced compares to other choices in the airport
"I really enjoyed this buffet.  We paid like $40 per person, I thought I would try it once, probably won't come back because I don't like paying $40 bucks for a dinner but hey it's vegas and I saw people tossing $50's  so I knew i was in the high roller section. I love the service, the food was decent well cooked the desserts were great!"
"This place is not good at all, got a vanilla cupcake. It was really dry and the buttercream tasted like pure crisco. Honestly not worth the money. The desserts look cute but you are better off getting cupcakes at sam's club or Costco to be quite honest, They are better there. Wonderland used very cheap ingredients and it showed today in my cupcake. Took a bite and threw it away. Rarely will I ever do that, even if it's not my favorite cupcake I can still consume it. Also I've had my fare share or bougie/ pricey cupcakes and they are worth every penny because of the quality ingredients going in and they taste delicious. Wonderland needs to step it up and fix their product and make it worth it or just buy Costco/ sam's club cupcakes and sell them as your own because the cupcake I had today was extremely disrespectful to consume."
"Ordered delivery on a rainy evening. Hot n sour soup, veggie roll and Kung Pao Chicken. The soup was fairly flavorful, although less spicy than I ordered. It will had a good taste. The veggie egg roll was kind of mushy on the inside. The Kung Pao chicken was good, just lacking the heat I thought I asked for.  You can order online and pay cash or credit.  Delivery took about 30 minutes or so. Which was pretty fast considering it was rush hour.  I would order again but probably ask for extra extra hot."
Amaze balls!!!! So cool! Full of people!  Great lights saw steve aoki and he killed it! Super fun and great for 20s and 30 year olds. Long lines when great head liners.
"Seldom does a manager make you feel so at home and is gracious and easy to work with.  On this visit, we met the manager, Brian Cambell and even though they were out of the gluten free crust, which is the reason we came, Brian went out of his way to apologize for the inconvenience and refund our money and encourage us to come back. He recommended us to another location, which was just as good.  We will be back to see Brian again. Thank you for making the extra effort."
UGH - the owner burns incense each morning!  Who would do that?  The place and clothing stinks to high heaven and if you are allergic or get migraines - you could have a reaction like I did.  If you are going to burn incense or smoke cigarettes (because what is the difference)   put a warning sign on the door!
"This review is for Jessica Calkins.  I found Jessica (then at another salon) in 2004. I did not have a recommendation as fate would have it, I called for an appointment, and was scheduled with her. Although I had a general idea of what I wanted, I had also brought her a picture, she worked with what I wanted to create a color/style to fit me. She has done my cut/color since then, so 9 years now??!!! When I moved away to college in Seattle she did my hair each time I came home.  Several friends and family members have also become Jessica's clients. For this reason I can say she has a broad range of skill for all ages. I'm in my late 20's (cut/color client) as is my sister. She does my mother's hair (in her late 50's) and also did all of the hair for my sisters wedding in 2006. Another friend, who is also a professional hairdresser, started seeing her as well and is pleased! Personally I have watched her work on ethnic hair and she is one of the rare few that has mastered ethnic in addition to other hair types. Her clientele includes men & children as well.  The other review about expediently cashing checks is not true. If you don't have funds to pay, don't write a check. Generally she will cash your check at the end of the week or within a few days. Jessica is very reasonable & accommodating. I would have no hesitation to ask her to wait a few days to cash a check (if needed). She's great at squeezing you in and managing time so you aren't waiting. When my mother had surgery she offered to come by our home to do her hair, just to make her feel a bit better during her recovery!   Color is her expertise and I find it works well if you just let her go with it. For example, if I want copper she will work in that guideline. She has made (blending multiple colors) custom colors on her own for me so they would flatter my coloring/features better. My hair doesn't turn heads, it breaks necks. I am constantly being told my hair is amazing by strangers, friends, co-workers, etc. She can do textbook what you want but letting her be creative with your hair is worth the risk! You will not be disappointed!  Jessica has never, ever done anything to my hair I disliked. Rather, she often will make ""fun"" (color or cut) pieces so I can change up my look day to day. She is a perfectionist that loves the craft and will check/double check your hair:) Several times she has told me if I don't like the way the color looks after a few washes, etc come in and she will tone/modify it for me so I am pleased. I can say this has NEVER been the case!  The icing on the cake is that she's fun to talk to. We always laugh and have a good time!"
"Huge place nice Music,the Food was Not bad"
It's hard to find a good consistent barber. Zeros offers top of the line service at competitive prices. This place is a nice family one stop shop. Mari is great with customers and does a great job. Keep up the good work.
"What is the concept here!? The apps lean toward Mexican/Latin inspired, the mains and side dishes are American, and the desserts are a little of everything.  First off the bread. Cold! Butter, ice cold. The small round french-type bread that was so chewy my jaw was sore. The second bread was a pretzel like bread shaped like a baguette, it was ok.   I ordered the chicken and it was served with mashed potatoes and a little bit of green beans. It was good, but nothing to write home about. I tasted the chili rubbed skirt steak and it was also good, but still not blowing me away.    Service was pretty slow. The brownie dessert was nothing special, but it was complimentary since we were celebrating a birthday.     Overall, I am pretty disappointed by my experience here. Except the decor, I really loved the chandelier. They do not have a restroom in the restaurant, so you can either go up an elevator to the club bathroom (what a waste of electricity) or walk out to the bathroom in the crystals center."
"There seem to be a lot of mixed reviews on whether this buffet is good for vegetarians or not, so here's my experience as a vegetarian getting lunch at the Wynn buffet! I was so pleased with the food -- a decent number of options, but more importantly, they were all so well cooked and delicious. Tons of creative and fresh salads (beet and citrus, red quinoa, roasted cauliflower, kale and butternut squash). As per usual, there was lots of roasted vegetable sides, but these were cooked/seasoned much better than at the average buffet. There was also veggie soups, vegan spring rolls and sushi, veggie polenta, veggie pizza, veggie pierogis, and braised tofu. Obviously, tons of delicious dessert options as well --overall, lunch was a great deal at under $30 per person."
"I am giving Hakkasan 3-stars simply because the operations did seem to run nicely and the space was incredible.  However, please understand that if I was simply reviewing our bottle service experience, I would give Hakkasan 1-star.    Let's first start with the main DJ being Tiesto.  His music isn't totally my style, but he was engaged in the crowd and the visual effects were awesome!  The sound system at Hakkasan is also something to note for electronic music lovers!  The line getting in wasn't anything because we were with a table.  Although the line to get in the elevator was a madhouse and all bouncers seemed confused....   Why our bottle service experience was ridiculously terrible:  - Our server would literally push people out of her way without even attempting to ask them to move first.  There are pictures of her pushing one guest so roughly, that she nearly fell .. and she did spill her entire drink out of her hand (which came out of our shared bottles).  She also would walk in the middle of groups taking pictures to simply pickup a napkin on the booth top?   - Our bouncer would not remove uninvited people from our table because he said ""nah, two of them work here and the other five are their friends, they get first dibs anywhere and since you're closest to Tiesto, they win"".  Is this serious?    - Our busser (?? or male server's assistant??) turned up our final Goose bottle to finish the last swig of alcohol.  I brought this up to the table ""owner"" if you will and he said he did that to 3 out of 4 Goose bottles we ordered, but the final bottle easily had a full drink left.  Wow.   And before the douchebags of Yelp think I am being petty about our table actually being OUR table... please note... I've partied with the hardest of them in this country and around the world.  I have never been treated like this at any other club in Vegas, NYC, Chicago, LA, Dubai, and beyond.  Additionally, the crew I was with is a group of very intelligent, kind, successful people. I've never heard so many uses of ""Please"" and ""Thank You"" at a nightclub than I did on this very night.    As such.... Hakkasan, your servers are ugly inside and out.  You should learn what the definition of hospitality is because that is the industry you're in and apparently your service staff is trash who doesn't understand THE CUSTOMER PAYS THEIR BILLS.  The customer is your boss.  You serve the customer.    Quite frankly, the server is lucky I wasn't paying the bill.  I would not have tipped her anything.  (And actually, the one bill we didn't tip her anything and she marched back, shook her head, said ""Uh Uh"", and handed him back the receipt for a tip. Again, a nice group of people that just gave in... but the tip was not deserved.)  And this is a Vegas nightclub?  HA. #wannabes"
SHAMIKA is the best stylist everyone loves my color and style! She takes her time to find ewhat is best for you.
"Got in last Saturday through a hook-up, no wait, no cover, score!  Door guys were friendly.  This place is huge and confusing.  There's 5 floors.  Floors 1 and 2 are the restaurant.  Floor 3 is hip hop room.  Floor 4 is EDM and floor 5 is a balcony overlooking the 4th floor.  Hip Hop room was great.  Loved it.  Had so much fun.  Steve Aoki played the main room and it was off the hook.  The light system in this place made me feel like I was on another planet.  It was insane!  Steve Aoki cakes people when he DJ's.  Be warned!  Cake everywhere and champagne showers.  Bartenders were pretty nice.  Never had a long wait to get drinks.  Place is super packed though.  I can't wait to go again.  Loved it!"
"""La Stella has a relatively low rating online, we enjoyed the food and would see it as under-appreciated overall. The dishes are very good value for the money."" This is just a tad of our flu experience!"
"I have been searching for a closest hair salon to get my hair done and it has been 8 months since I got my hair colored the last time. I decided to pamper myself by looking for the nearest salon that I could try out. I tried to find the hours of this place but i could not find anything so I decided to call yesterday and no calls.  I figured most places will be closed on sundays so I decided to try after work the next day. Here I am, waiting for the bus and I decided to give them a call and see what their hours were - In hopes of walking to get my hair done and pamper myself.   When the person picked up, I couldn't hear very well so I turned up the volume on my phone - this was after I asked ""what are your hours"" and I asked what time do you close after turning up the volume on my phone. I think she first mentioned ""it varies on the last person that is finished (the last hair stylist that finishes their client)"" and when I asked again when turning up the volume she said ""Again, it depends on the person that finishes last""  I was very taken back to receive a very rude answer not to mention she had a slight rude attitude about it. I did not pursue any further and just said thank you and hung up.  Their website is no where near finished and is ""under construction""   I understand the reviews may be quite wonderful and such. May it be ""honest"" reviews or reviews to just say they are awesome to bring in more customers, but clearly just that one call and looking on their website for hours and prices.....seem to fail to meet customer satisfaction.  It is very sad that I have not had my hair done in 8 months and I live very close to this place. I was going give them good  business and a very good review from all the reviews I have previously read.  However, I changed my mind after that phone call and rude person on the end. I will not go here and go else where to someone who wants my business and knows how to satisfy customers even if it is something small like hours and prices for they maybe interested in dropping by.  Thank you Sassy chic salon, I understand the origin of your name for this place."
I've stopped at a few Love's gas stations on my way across country but this one had the lowest number of amenities & food options. The restrooms at this location were not as clean as the others I've visited but better than your average gas station. Racing & Rv fuel were available which I thought was great!
I thought it was just okay. In the D terminal of United you really dont get that many options so I went here for a burger. The waitress was quick and although she didnt ask how I wanted my burger cooked it still came out medium which made me happy. For two burgers and two tap waters the bill came out to $35. Yikes a little pricey yes but like I said I didnt' have much of a choice. After the fact I realized that I should've just used their to-go stand and purchased a pre-made sandwich.  I will say that their breakfast menu sounds pretty delicious so if I was stuck in the D terminal again before 10:30am I wouldn't mind giving it a whirl.
"Pretty decent I guess, but nothing super exceptional or anything to write home about. The place is pretty busy every night, which is good considering the area. But I like that they're open till midnight, gives you a late night option. Their menu is pretty wide ranging, and as a vegetarian I like that there are some good options for someone like me. I believe they also have bubble tea and some speciality drinks available. Worth checking out if you're in the area!"
Ehhh...not impressed.. Brunch was so so. Food wasn't too great. My friend had been before and said the quality had declined.   35 for brunch and 16 for unlimited mimosas.. Just not worth it IMO
"Besos review  Beso's is a very nice place though a tad bit noisy when full. We like many reviewers here used an $79 Travelzoo voucher for a dinner supposedly worth $200. if you have one of these be prepared to be treated like a 2nd class customer. They seem to look down on you just because you are trying to get a deal on a dinner actually worth about price of voucher. Standard drinks from the bar are $14 each so keep that in mind before ordering.  Because of voucher, you can only chose select items on the menu. The crab cake appetizer was not bad. The sides mac and cheese and green beans we average at best. The main entre, 8oz steak filet was cooked perfectly and tasty. The champaign was not very good. I would say this steak dinner was not even close to worth $200 and barely worth the price of the $79 Travelzoo voucher. I have had better steaks and sides at The Outback for 1/4 the price. Also it was dinner for 2, but they automatically added $30 gratuity based on value of dinner, $198, so that was odd because service was not that good and food not worth the price.  I will complain to Travelzoo.  Pro's: - nice place - decent service - good steak  Con's: - $30 gratuity automatically added - average food at best - rude staff - Eve club passes were supposed to be included but Eve went bankrupt 3 days ago. - pricy average bar drinks"
"Actually I question the need for the renovation.  The acoustics are beer hall loud and add the ability to seat large groups...total distraction.  We were surrounded by a group of 16 and 10 respectively.  The hostess contented she was unaware of such a large group scheduled for lunch....hello, the tables were joined and set for a large gathering.  We found this disingenuous.  The food was average, not the great fare of the pre renovation.  Apparently a waste of resources with an inferior outcome.  You must like loud to sit on the second level...."
"Visited this restaurant on Friday night for 1st time.  Everything was amazing.  Food, drinks,  background music and our waiter Derek.  He helped us make some good food and drink choices.  Love the patio.  Cannot say anything negative. Can't wait to come back and try a different menu item."
"There are two consistent tasting things on the menu. The chicken....and the waffles. Go figure! Don't get me wrong, its about the best soul food we have in the Valley. I'm from the Midwest and entire family is Southern...its certainly not the best I've ever had. In fact, not even close! But it'll do.  Don't be mad Lo-Lo's lovers! You know I'm right about the inconsistent service and food. Your scrambled eggs will come out 5 min AFTER your main meal! IF you get them at all! Seriously!  The sweet tea is yum...although it will def put you in a sugar coma!!!   Did anyone mention having to wait outside in the Summer at 110 degrees for an hour for a table? Bring a portable fan! LOL! But seriously, its great food! Just don't expect great service.   Bon Appetite!"
"A couple months ago, I bought a travelzoo voucher which offered a champagne dinner for two for $79. With all the noise about bankruptcies at Eve and Beso. I was unsure how long the restaurant would be able to keep its doors open.  So far, so good. Beso is stayin' alive. They actually had a large crowd dining last night. I would not expect tables to be near capacity on a Sunday evening, but they did just that.  We received warm bread and soft butter to get us started. That's always a good combo, all too often we run into room temperature bread and ice cold butter.  With the voucher we had our choice of appetizer, two soups or salads, two entrees and a shared dessert - no choice offered, but we could substitute a side dish, if we wanted.  We began with calamari. This was a good version, tender with a light crisp breading. Topped with tomatoes, peppers, cojita cheese and served with lime and two dipping sauces.  Next, we had the Beso Caprese with avocado and the seafood louie salad. The caprese was the better choice by far, there was nothing notable about the louie - at all. The seafood didn't seem fresh and the salad was overly dressed.  Then, for entrees, Frank had the 16oz NY strip and I went with a 12oz filet. Both were really good, with a nice crust. Neither of us could finish.   Dessert was churros with caramel sauce and chantilly cream. Yum!  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant just might stay alive."
"The absolute WORST food from a pizza place that I've had in Henderson. I've only had delivery from them, so in house may be different, but I highly doubt it. Because they're terrible.   In the past I have ordered a pepperoni pizza and plain chicken tenders, and while the tenders were ""meh"", the pizza was OK.   This time we ordered a ""The Greek"" pizza, which was extremely disappointing. It sounds much more delicious than it actually is, and looks very unappetizing. We ate a couple slices and then threw the rest away.   The real nightmare was the chicken tenders. I ordered chicken tenders, ""hot""  style with extra ranch, with CRISPY fries. I reiterated several times that the fries should be crispy, or ""well done"".   This was misinterpreted as ""I want a literal half pint of awful ranch flavored water with my disgusting microwaved chicken, with a side of gross soggy potato strings.""   I will NEVER waste my money on this awful restaurant EVER again.   I tipped the delivery guy extremely well, because I understand the plight of the service industry employee, but I would highly recommend AGAINST ever ordering delivery from this place. Seriously. Just awful."
"Very disappointed! Ordered delivery, food was cold and bland.  Worst general TSO chicken ever tasted."
"First and foremost, the pizza is awesome! The ranch dressing is also pretty RAD. However, the service at this spot left a terrible taste in my mouth. 2 weeks ago I ordered delivery, just a medium pie and salad for grand total of about $24. Standard operating procedure dictates card over the phone, no big deal. 1 hour and 45 minutes later, plus two phone calls my cold, somewhat icky food arrives. The delivery guy comps the grub and apologizes for the wait. I tip him $3 on the card, five days later I have a charge for $43 on my card. I call and tell them about the mistake ( hey, we all make em') , I'm told to bring my statement in to get a refund because cash is raise for them than crediting the card. Ok. I go in today and encounter a SNOTTY, NASTY girl behind the counter who did absolutely nothing to help other than be insulting and tell me to come back when there is someone there who can help. Wow, really?"
"I usually don't review service vendors but am making an exception due to the great service from Dignity Moving. I had a fairly unique project of large (and heavy) multi piece bookcase/file cabinet unit for a remodel where I researched and tried to contact many different moving companies. Daniel was always prompt on his responses with clear info. Their pricing was fair and fit what I needed. And, they were right on time for arrival at my house which is something I haven't experienced with other companies in the past. They work efficiently and they take care when moving the future. I not only recommend them but will use them again in the future."
"Food is alright, nothing stood out. Ramen is just terrible, terrible and terrible - don't even try it. We wonder who put it together. Taco is pretty good. The Hispanic cook there, Francisco, deserves 10 stars for his relentless effort and professionalism. The ""street"" tacos he made actually tasted pretty good too. Service is above average."
"I was regularly using Oxford Cleaners as our dry cleaners and was pleased with their services. Then 2 weeks ago I took a pair of newer crop white pants to be dry cleaned. When I went to wear them I noticed a dark streak on the crease line which was definitely not there when I took them for cleaning. After some discussion,they agreed to clean them again and remove the stain. When I took them home I realized the stain went from bad to worse,now it covered an area of approx 8x6 inches and was a yellow colour. Back to Oxford Cleaners for round 3!! Some improvement but still very noticeable. At this point I went to see the manager at their store at Riggs and Gilbert. She said they were not responsible for any staining and would try once more,but that was it. When I picked them up for the 4th time,they were still noticeably stained. I was told they were not cleaning them again,would take no responsibility and of course,no compensation. The manner in which I was treated every time was unprofessional,rude,total lack of customer service. I cannot believe they can stay in business with that sort of service."
"Being a NYC foodie with access to the best dining fine or otherwise in the world, I thought a great option for us in vegas would be a high end buffet. After I researched we chose the Wynn. Apparent I didn't do my research well. Their slogan fine dining meets all you can eat is only true on the latter. Besides being some of the worst prepared food I've ever had, there was nothing creative, high end or remotely palate worthy. Unimpressively embarrassing below par food. Bland, tasteless cafeteria style prepared food with a severely limited carving station. STAY AWAY"
Scheduled with Noteworthy for Wednesday 1/15/14 - Owner called the night before to confirm appointment for Wed arrival between 8:30 and 9:00AM.  Arrived as scheduled at 8:35 the next morning.  Moved in a baby grand with precision and care.  The delivery and set up was completed within 30 minutes.
If you are from NY you know how hard it is to find good pie in this town.  Considering the water quality they have to work with this place is not half bad.  Good prices and close to my abode .... 4 stars!
"Disappointed in the customer service of Oxford Dry Cleaners . They lost articles of clothing and refuse to reimburse. Summer, the manager is claiming that they can only offer in store credit. If they lose our household's clothes, why on earth would we trust them with more clothing??? Bad business.  I have uploaded a picture with the ""conditions""-it says nothing about in store credit."
Meh!  Meh!   Meh!    This buffet was recommended to my boyfriend and I so we waiting in a loooooog line on a Sunday.    There were two things I was looking for in the buffet - crab legs and  Eggs Benedict.  This Sunday buffet did not offer *either* of them.  It was very disappointing.      There was nothing special about this buffet - it was the typical frozen food prepped and sitting out under a warming light.
"Can you say gong show?  Our husbands/bfs/friends had a table but it took what seemed like forever to get in.  They were inside and it was 1:30am or so.  No line, just a mass of people hovering behind the velvet ropes trying to get the attention of the dude with the clipboard.    A lot of complaints about stairs?  We took the elevator.  No problem.    I understand it's a thing here, but people asking for Steve Aoki to ""cake me"" was...  quite the sight.  How do you continue clubbing afterwards, smothered in cream?  I guess I'm just old.  I don't see the appeal.    The raft was pretty cool though, crowd surfing in a raft!  Yeah!  We had a table on the balcony and it was a great view of all the excitement going on down below.  We didn't get crushed by the other club-goers.    I do have to say though, randoms would walk in and stand next to us even though it was right next to our table.  This space should've been shared with only the bottle service patrons.  A premium was paid for great service by our attractive server, but there wasn't enough security to keep the strangers on the other side.  All in all, a most memorable night!  If you like EDM, are willing to drop lots of cash, check this place out!"
"Ordered a large pizza, half a bucket of wings and a ham sub. Delivery took 33 minutes. Pizza was true New York style, wings tasted like they were straight from Buffalo and the sub was amazing. Very pleased. Great quality awesome prices and fabulous service!!"
"It was bad -_- The drinks, the food and the service. I've always liked Tenren and I wanted to try out this ""new"" location out. We ordered:  MILK TEA The milk tea was so bitter and tasted so bad. Its so watered down.  SESAME MILK TEA The whole drink tasted like undissolved powder - It was so bad. You can see the two sections in different colours (one for the undissolved powder and another is the watery substance).   PU-ERH BEEF NOODLES  It wasn't even the green noodles that we get at the other Tenren locations (shouldn't all franchise locations have the same menu?). It was just plain noodles which weren't very good either. Soup base was sooo oily. We proceeded to ask the waitress about the noodles but her response was that only the Highway 7 location had the spinach noodles (Which is not true because other locations provided this dish with spinach noodles).  Will not return."
"Maitre d was fairly horrendous. No coat room and essentially refused/was otherwise unhelpful regarding storing luggage before/during dining.  Average steakhouse, filet mignon was good. Some decent fish options - salmon, sea bass, halibut but nothing breathtaking."
"Hill Street Design House is a beautiful building on Hill Street that is busting full of current and upcoming artists, film makers, interior designers, dress makers, and in essence dream weavers. Home to 7 spacious and well light studios, this place isn't just for hire to those looking for rooms to work from, they also have a room for hire at the front where they host some super amazing workshops that I have become super accustom to!   So far I have been to the Karen Mabon scarf making workshop (and now own one hella cool pin up girl silk scarf that I designed!), the El-Aich ceramic painting class (where I created a tasty looking rainbow sprinkles mug) and I even got the chance to go to the Yelp 'Space Cats' party (which was so kawaii cute, tasty and fun I don't know where to begin!)   If you're looking for a great way to spend the day, learn a new skill and create something totally unique, defo check out what's on at Hill Street Design House. With plenty of upcoming events, I'm actually signed up to the newsletter so I don't miss out on early bird tickets (be warned: they often sell out fast!) And let me just say right now, it's not just for girls. There is a whisky tasting event coming up that I have plans to get a bunch of tickets to as gifts - who doesn't want to go to that?!  The event room is really bright, it's in the centre of town so transportation to and from is no bother and let's not forget it's near some really great pubs (perfect for celebrating your hard work in afterwards!) The classes are really affordable, pretty different to the other stuff that I've seen in Edinburgh and are always well run. Plus I have popped in here to get a dress made by RowanJoy recently, and everyone in house seems really sweet and helpful (not to mention SUPER talented!)"
It was a beautiful thing........and a nightmare at the same time. What do you do when you're in a candy store and your teeth are wired shut?  Watch other people enjoy the food...
"Wow. Way overpriced and the food tasted like it was seasoned with a million pounds of salt. Selection was limited and was s very generic buffet. I've been to better ones at jankier casinos. So it's about 50/person and they only had about 4-5 different cuts of meat (soaked in sodium). Maybe two vegetable options, a small salad bar that you might not see if you walk by, and a soggy shrimp cocktail area. Definitely walk a little further down the strip and go elsewhere. Woke up super puffy from all of the salt."
"I have stayed in a number if hotels out here in Vegas and this by far has to be the biggest joke of a hotel.  Parking is a nightmare the ""suite"" is time I think the closet is bigger than the kitchen and has a werid smell to it and the room has no view of the bellagio water show can hear it but that it.  There is also no room service you have to walk to the Cosmo for the closest food or have a microwaved pizza that they say is delivered to the lobby but it's not it's cooked there.  And I don't think I've seen a CD player in a hotel room in 10 years.... Horrible I may not even finsh my stay here"
"We went to the buffet last week, 1/12/2015. We were staying at the hotel, and my (slender) husband loves it. But even he was surprised at how badly it had slipped. A 4--5 foot stretch of hacked-up kielbasa and Polish sausage? A too-big ""taco wagon?"" Cute idea, but they ran way too far with it. It was more like a college cafeteria than a Las Vegas, Wynn experience.  The Wynn Buffet has fallen several notches since our last visit. They are harming their own reputation by continuing it, in my opinion.  Even the dessert offerings were paltry, in comparison to former glory days, anyway.  Not only did we not have to wait, there were practically tumbleweeds blowing through the place.  Here is what I think: The Wynn no longer wants to have a buffet, perhaps not wanting ""buffet people"" cluttering up the place, and they are letting it die by inches, seeing how long they can still milk some $ out of their guests. And maybe this will be a trend. But don't do this to people who are expecting a treat.  For the record, my husband was happy with the shrimp, some ""seared"" fish, and some bread pudding. And I concentrated on the ""Asian:"" green beans with spicy tofu were good. Potstickers.  (Kind of like Trader Joe's.)   The servers were great.  Suggestion: either step it up, or put it out of its misery."
"When this place is on they are on.  They can give good cuts.  There are a few here that give you great haircuts like Jesse.  But there are some of the barbers there that are more concerned with talking to their ""dawgs"" on the phone or texting somebody.  So you could be in the middle of a haircut and they will stop, pick up the phone, and start texting, or answer the the phone and proceed to to have a 10 minute convo while your there with a half finished haircut.  Some of them act like they would rather be doing something else instead of concentrating on doing your hair.   Like I said it's not all of them, but it is a few of them."
"Stumbled upon this unpretentious place while driving through nowhere. Probably an old burger joint converted to a Viet restaurant resulting in an odd decor but a familiar restaurant experience.  We ordered three dishes between the two of us, probably too much food. My grilled chicken on vermicelli dish was very tasty. The barbequed meat was dark, nicely flavored, and the dish wasn't excessively filled with noodles either. My friend ordered beef wrapped in betel leaves and he enjoyed it as well. We got an order of pancake and it was this fabulous looking thing (see my pics) stuffed with bean sprouts and bit of shrimp and pork. The dish had generous amounts of basil and mint which I really love about Vietnamese food.  No frills service and minimalist ambience but tasty food nonetheless!"
"A friend of mine was stuck at home on a rainy Friday working on a paper for her Masters degree.  She sent out a FB post asking is someone would be kind enough to bring her a latte. Coffee sounded great so I headed to this Starbucks close to her home. It was packed!!  I thought it was going to take me forever to get coffee. Boy was I wrong. They had 2 cashiers ringing up people, 2 people making coffees, and one person making sure the stock of what the baristas needed were full. It was like a well oiled machine. I was in and out in only a few minutes. As quick as people were leaving, others were coming in. And all of the employees were nice and they were smiling. IMPRESSIVE!!"
Horrible service!  Waited 45 mins just to order and we are the ONLY customers here. Terrible nut from reading the reviews I am happy to take my business elsewhere.
"SHAMIKA is awesome! It had been a year since I cut my hair, and it was so long it was unmanageable. I'm a busy mom with a new baby, so I don't have a lot of time to fix my hair...(okay, and i'm just lazy, and just want to throw my hair back, but still have it look good tbt). I was really nervous about where to go since I had been putting off cutting my hair for so long, so I took a chance and purchased a Groupon at Blush since it was close to my home. Am I glad I did! First off, when I called to make the appointment, I was nervous to mention I purchased a GROUPON (back luck in the past), but the receptionist was really sweet. She asked me which GROUPON i purchased then set me up with an appointment for the next day. When I arrived I was greeted warmly and checked in. I met Shamika and told her what I was looking for. She was really easy going and personable. We chatted while hands worked their magic. She took her time, but still worked quickly and even managed to curl my hair. She works effortlessly and really pays attention to detail. Definitely recommend the place, great atmosphere and wonderful service."
"The food was ok... but with so many other places to eat in Vegas nothing I would return for. In fact, I thought  my dish was a tad over-salted, drowning out any of the crab flavor that was supposed to be the star of the dish.  I'm pushing the rating up a star because our service was excellent and my mojito was delish!  The wait staff took excellent care of us and made great drink recommendations.  It would be good for a large group looking to enjoy some great cocktails or a girl's night out pre-party snack, becasue the portions are a bit small..."
Thanks to Guest list Las Vegas i got in for free and saw Cash Cash . The only thing is the drinks are expensive a little over priced but of course its Vegas so F*** it lol !
"Upon entering the chuck burger, I was welcomed with a yelling ""WHOS NEXT"" and an annoyed request for my order.  Although they have guacamole, the chefs are too lazy to slice avocado for more health conscious customers.  The bacon guacamole burger was a 7/10, pretty good! The fries weren't bad, but the tap water leaves an unpleasant metallic aftertaste.  Although the food is good, I would not come again."
"Went for the brunch on Friday and Saturday.  Why did I go back?  Hoping that Friday was a fluke and that the quality of the food would improve on a Saturday after all the good reviews on Yelp.  Wrong.  First the food is pricey and so-so.  Also for cafeteria fare, you can do better.  A place that comes to mind (but is not buffet style) that feels like The Buffet is the cafeteria at McCoy's Station in Mammoth.  Lots of variety and a hell lot better in taste and quality than The Buffet.  The shrimp were anemic.  The prime rib was lukewarm.  The buffet breakfast food at Disneyland tastes a hell lot better than The Buffet brunch food."
The stylist that did my hair  is Jolene Gomez.  She really knows how to tame this thick wavy hair.  My favorite is the deep condition shampoo style.  However Im looking into having a kertan treatment.  The boutique style salon is tucked away but a hidden gem for sure.
"Inconsisten. Will not go there for the pho.. only for the  pad Thai. Yummm so  thick with tamarind sauce and sugar..  I always order the  chicken and shrimp  pad Thai. Its spicy savory.. garlicky, moist and comforting. don't forget to order the honeydew bubble tea . Perfect for tempering down the spiciness of the meal.  The egg rolls a perfect loyal companion."
"I'm not much of a buffet eater, but this buffet is like no other.  There is seriously so much quality food here that you'll have to prioritize what you plan on eating.  My wife and I, along with her aunt and uncle, attempted unsuccessfully to try ""a little of everything"".  This technique proved no match for such a mighty buffet.  Come here hungry and you MUST save room for dessert...trust me."
"One of the few places to sit down and eat in the United gates section. Selection of beer is quite limited. I think wine selection fares better - while also small, it offers decent variety. Had glass of Benzinger Merlot, and it was very good. White Chicken and Mushroom Chili soup had good flavor - could've use a bit more mushrooms. The soup was served with a big blob of sour cream in a middle, which was rather distracting from the overall dish. If you will have this soup, may be ask for the sour cream on the side. Also had Turkey Club Panini, served with French fries. The French fries were crispy and well executed. The choice of bread was strange for panini (focaccia? too thick). The dish advertises chipotle mayo as one of the ingredients - there was a little package of standard mayo on a side - and even if there was something inside the sandwich, it was impossible to taste. If you mention ingredient in the menu, it is better be present...   Overall, it is an okay place, and if you want table and the service, this might be your best choice in that section on the gates (D50)"
"Lauren Bremner is a hair angel sent to me from heaven. She has remarkable skill with cut, style and color and is also very personable. I will be back!"
"Noodles were less than average as they were still hard and stuck together by the end of our meal. Seafood noodles didn't have much content, vegetarian spring rolls were good but a little on the expensive side.  Would rather go back to Pho Con Bo around the corner next time."
Well after all these weeks I was able to find a gingerbread man cookie! Small and tasty it was the only place that I found that sold them this holiday season.  I noticed that Starbucks now sells Tevana tea. I ordered a cup to go with my cookie. It was scalding hot it burnt the inside of my mouth and had no real flavor to it. Next time I will stick with what they are noted for which is coffee.  Starbucks's offers free Wifi and there is a leisurely area you can relax in.
"LOUD!! Music is always loud even on a Saturday or Sunday morning or early week night evening - I don't get it.  The staff has always been very friendly, attentive with good food and a good beer selection. I just don't want to go somewhere where I can not have a conversation.  Ear deafening sound almost every time we've been here.  Now we do a sound check by just driving by and if we can hear the music in the car it's a no go."
"Quick spot for lunch, but nothing fancy.  The food is pretty good and service is quick. If only they'd make the place look a bit more like their fancy website - I was a little mislead, thinking this was going to be more of a sit-down, waiter service style restaurant, but overall still a nice lunch location.  Best Tip about this place: They have real Chinese television on at their location - no english subtitles either."
"If anyone reads, they are going out of business. Go there, you may have to sift but I have found some great deal!"
"Disappointing experience. They messed up on our orders more than once. They took one of the steaks off the bill, which was nice of them, but the experience was underwhelming. With so many other options, I won't be returning."
"Too many people. Music too loud, drinks extremely expensive. Wouldn't go there again for sure."
"I give it one star because, as others say, they are terrible from the consignors point of view.  As a consignment store, they are definitely far more expensive than most, so hoping to get a higher return for my clothing, I consigned about ten items.  When I checked back several months later, they said they had only sold one item and the rest had been donated.  As others have complained, they do not have accurate records of what was sold or donated.  Very unprofessional.  I will stay with My Sister's Closet.  Their prices are low so you don't make much as a consignor, but they are honest and it's very easy and upfront to get paid when they sell your stuff.  Beware of ""High Society""."
Love Tommy Bahama's food.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The fish dishes are especially awesome and all of their appetizers are delicious and perfect for sharing.  They have an interesting drinks menu with a strong island theme - and their bartenders really make great drinks (including some fun non-alcoholic options like the mint and basil lemonade).    Their plantain chips (if you're a banana fan) should not be missed - they're a delicious side... as is their cauliflower.  My only complaint is that if they are busy - the service is slow and frequently it takes a long time for drink refills and anything you need with your meal (i.e. nobody 'checks' on you and how your meal is going once they take your initial order... they just get the food out to you).    Food rocks!
"Easy access from the freeway, plenty of pumps so you can always get right on one.."
"I'm only giving 1 star because you can't give 0 what a waste of time!! My husband got a call from a guy from the jockey club saying he had won round trip tickets to anywhere we wanted and 8 show tickets to any show of our choice on the strip! LIE we went and sat through their 2 HOUR timeshare presentation which we can't afford! Got hounded by 6 different people to buy a time share when the guy over the phone said all we had to do was come pick up our ""gifts"" he said NOTHING about a timeshare over the phone! Then when we finally got to the part of getting our ""gifts"" we got our voucher for the plane tickets which they then proceeded to tell us all the fees we have to pay along with them! Which came out to about $400 which we don't have! Then they give us the show tickets not only did we not get to pick them Out but they are crappy shows we have NEVER heard of! They are a HUGE SCAM!!!"
This is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in T.O. The food is always good and the service is friendly. The other factor that makes this Vietnamese restaurant unique in Toronto is that it is actually owned and operated by Vietnamese!
"I like to eat at the bar because I'm a huge sports fan!, and they have a great bartender that makes phenominal drinks, but it seems like every time I've been in there, he's always working an looks a little run down, but always friendly.  Probably would suggest you hire more reliable bartenders like the one that's always there. ."
"Soooo....  Visited here early last year with a group of friends. Since we were staying in the hotel we decided why not check out Hakkasan since its right downstairs after all. I'm not really sure what kind of experience we would have had elsewhere, but our time here was interesting to say the least.   Now, at what point does this venue say ""hey, we've reached capacity!!"" ?!?! It was literally unreasonably packed on the main club floor...and from what I saw, the club seemed really, realllly large! So from one standpoint, its quite impressive that they can manage to fill their venue the way they did. However, for my particular tastes, it was way too pushy and crowded to be even the slightest bit enjoyable.   Instead of staying on the main dance floor, we conveniently retreated to the restaurant portion (actually right where we had dinner only hours prior) and had a grand, grand time...but my friends and I always have a ball together regardless, so depending on the experience you're looking for, this may or may not be the place."
We had the buffet at the Wynn on a Friday for lunch and were very disappointed. The selection and taste of the food was mediocre at best. The $25.99 price per buffet was definitely not worth it and we felt ripped off. We expected much more.
"3.5 star.  Not for budget bride, this boutique has designer dresses that are expensive (thus the 3.5 star. They stock some unique designers that can't be found anywhere else in Ontario/Canada.  Despite the dresses being WAY out of my budge, I still had a great experience. Decor is beautiful and I was oohing and aahing over all the bling on the dresses. The change room area is beautifully set up. My dress consultant was very knowledgeable about dress styles and bridal fashions that are popular on the runway. She was not pushy and I took this visit more as a learning experience   A few doors down is their consignment store (Ginger's Closet) which a bit more affordable if you are looking for their designer dresses."
"I don't mind waiting in line for couple hours as long as the food is worth the wait.  In fact the staffs are very nice they even gives out bottle waters for people in line.  But the food is NOT worth the $50 per person and the time, you'll waste between 4 to 5 hours for some sub-par, overpriced foods, that's ridiculous!!    Personally I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.  Unless you are a high roller at Wynn, you can eat for free and walk straight in.  These are just my personal options."
i really wanted to love this place but i gotta say it wasnt as great as some people pump it up to be .....dont get me wrong the food was good but not mind blowing
"if you follow my rants, then you know i am not a big fan of chains of any kind. i rarely spend my money at these establishments, much preferring to give local chefs my hard earned money, and keep the money in the valley. but i have a friend who loves going to tommy bahamas on kierland, so i figured what the heck, i will give it a try. and i was pleasently surprised by the lunch, which i enjoyed. the sour dough bread was fresh and the butter tasty.  i started with a crab bisque, which for a bowl, could have been a bit more generous sized portion. but it was a rich concoction. and very good. there was a miscommunication in the kitchen and another one arrived at my table, which they allowed me to enjoy at no extra charge. for entrees, i had fish tacos, with mahi mahi. the food was fresh, though i prefer a bit more spice. the inside of the taco was rather bland, perhaps blackening it would have helped. but my guest had a delicious arugala salad, with HUGE scallops and shrimp, cooked just right. he said it was his favorite dish there, and i can understand why. our waiter was just starting his new job, and dave did the best he could. i wish him the best. he was nice, polite and gave us space and territory allowing my guest and i to have a conversation without any intrusion. he offered to show us the dessert tray, which i thought was rather pedestrian. the only one which may have tempted me at another time would have been the key lime pie. all in all, i would recommend this place."
"Snobs.  A woman working there asked my friend if she was from Scottsdale.  When friend said she was from Phoenix, the woman turned and walked away."
"Always friendly staff ready to greet customers & place their orders. I stick to the classic pepperoni pizza and it's always made to taste buds' heaven. I've gone in during a lunch hour work & high school early release rush and I still was able to enjoy a decent amount of time for lunch i.e. they were quick to serve. So far, no complaints on my end."
"Not much to say aside from I came in here needing furniture and not a single person said hello or offered assistance as I browsed for fifteen minutes, even when I saw them looking at me. Not impressed, so I took my business elsewhere."
"Huge portions, food not bad, but not good.  Plan on splitting an entree.  Nice ambience though!"
"First time at Hakkasan was NYE, tickets were expensive however we were happy to pay to see Calvin Harris for NYE even though male tickets were $250++ & female tickets were $150++.  Our experience was awful. The club staff (everyone) were extremely rude. Drink prices were hiked up for the night and everywhere you stood you were yelled at by staff to move along.  Our group assumed it was due to NYE why the club was so horrible so we tried it again another night.  Staff were still rude and you still couldn't stand anywhere right.  Club layout is also very confusing but not the main disappointment.  Won't ever go back. Try XS at Wynn/encore if you like being treated like a human and having a great night out!"
Packed as a mofo... But nice music and a helluva time. No where else I'd rather be with my friends.
Shamika is awesome!  She always does what I ask for and it always turns out better than what I asked for.  I highly recommend her!
"My family of 6 whent for vaction in toronto and ate here. The service was terrible they didn't bring us fish sauce, not enough chop sticks, no knife to cut the pork chops, no waters as we wrote down on the paper and the food had no taste. Only good thing I can say about it is the soup broth tasted okay. Don't recommend this to anyone.  And the washroom are messy"
"Horrible store and conditions! Spent $50 on a male and a female cichlid, both died within a week, after the refund period, with a parasidic disease, that none of my other fish have! Ask about molly fry! You'll be disgusted! They'll fish them out of the whole house basment system! AVOID!"
"I've taken suits and dresses here to be dry cleaned prob 8 times and never had problems, but the last two times our clothes have come back smelling like mildew. I thought it was a one time fluke, so I took the same suit back to be re-cleaned the next week to get rid of the smell, along with another suit and a few dress shirts. I didn't complain or demand money back, I just paid for it to be cleaned a second time and figured it isn't that big of a deal. But I pick it up two days later and every piece smells of mildew again. I thought maybe I just have a sensitive nose, but when my husband got dressed, he noticed the smell too. The clothes all looked great, but the odor was the problem. I've taken clothes there plenty of times before and not had a problem, but am annoyed we now have to take them to be cleaned again."
"I spend quite a bit of time in this store during a certain season of the year. I make them pull down the ridiculous spiders that are hanging from the ceiling. I make them pull props that aren't necessarily priced. I always have my coupons and sometimes have to go back and get more to make it worth my while. Seems like they have a new staff every year, but what can you do? It is the nature of the thing. I do appreciate that they have fairly priced items and that they put things out in advance. And the service has not been bad per say--at least I have not thought this to be the case. I do think they should keep batteries in the store to test items."
"The food is excellent but with little difference between the other main Vegas strip buffets. The 1 rating is due to the rude service we received trying to seat our party of 8. We respectfully and repeatedly tried to tell our seating waitress that we will not split our party. Instead they tricked us by walking us to the back, and then telling us we need to split tables or walk back. I will definitely tell my friends not to go here."
"Many of my friends dig Barro's Pizza and come here for a weekly lunch as a tradition. So I decided to tag along today to see what the fuss was all about and quite frankly, I'm not that impressed.  The hot wing pizza I had was overly greasy and rich. It became the undoing of my stomach lining, causing peptic ulcers left, right, anterior posterior, superior and inferior. There was no end in sight. Like Mordor, my innards became a barren wasteland devoid of life and happiness.  As the poison passed through my body, it erupted from me like the fiery lava of Mt. Doom. The contents that spilled out scorched me like a whip from within. Such pains and labors I had to endure until I was rid of this heavy burden. Even my friends that took me here no longer seem like themselves to me. I can trust them no longer. ""Share the load,"" they keep telling me. But I know that this is my talisman to carry and nobody else's...  My time on the porcelain throne was a hardship I would not wish upon my greatest nemesis. The sight of a grown man crying is one of the most difficult to swallow. Gandalf's words kept ringing in my ears, ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"" Indeed, I feared that this pizza would never pass and would become my burden to bear for all time. To grow inside me like a tumor and become a part of me. But thankfully, it eventually did pass and the tower of Sauron fell and we have peacetime now! =)  As for my rating of Barro's, nay. You shall not pass. You fail. Though I give you props for doing what few have done to my body. My immune and digestive systems are among the most proficient and powerful in all the land and you've bested both. Let Barro's name be heard and feared as one that will forever live in infamy."
"Amazing ambiance, delicious drinks and dessert and the staff was outstanding!"
"It's not bad. The dining room is small, so if it's too busy like at the opening, it can feel cramped. Food was good, but I didn't find it worth the price. It's good, so you can't go wrong, but there are better spots in Montreal."
Disgusting!!!! The bartending was cold and offended my boyfriend numerous times. To top it off the food was inedible! I used to love this place but I will not be returning
"Absolutely the best pizza in Las Vegas! Although it's not just pizza, everything Italian, sandwiches, salads and pastas are all great. Service is excellent. It's comfortable and you feel like your home, small town feel and you always run into someone you know. I highly recommend you get a large to take home some leftovers!"
"Stopped in for lunch with friends and had good experience, but nothing that would blow your mind. I have been to this location a few times and have always had similar experiences. The setting is nice and have always enjoyed the seating options (outside in shade covered seating or inside with a darker, comfort feel). The staff have always been fine and provided good customer service. They come by as needed but seems like it is only because they have to.  As for the food, I have never had a dish I did not like but also never anything that made me super excited to come back. Are you reading a pattern here? Today, I tried to the prime vig dip. It really did look amazing, but just did not have that wow factor. Every meal I have had has been carried by the tasty fries. Overall, a decent stop for downtown Phoenix, but not a place I think about when planning for a nice meal out."
"Surprisingly good BBQ. Not a fan of the sides, but the pork is great, tangy with vinegar."
"Doesn't have the most amenities or best dining options, but love's definitely seems to care more about drivers than any other truck stop/travel center around.  Free showers and coffee(others have stopped) with fuel purchases and the best rewards program in general.    I try to spend my money here, if at all possible, rather than any other big truck stop.  Keep looking out for drivers, love's, it's very much appreciated.  This particular Love's happens to be ideally located within walking distance of a decent casino, several restaurants and an outlet shopping center.  My sole criticism of this particular love's would be the restaurant inside... Arby's, you get no love from this driver."
"It was freakin' freezing and we both wanted some hot soup and immediately thought of Vietnamese Pho. So, we looked for a place close and found this shop.  I had the Pho and my friend had the crunchy noodles. Both were really good!!  The portions were pretty big and neither of us could finish even though we wanted to.  Great local spot with great food!"
"There is very little  to eat in this hood that isn't fast food-y and frankly, I could eat pho everyday. I haven't branched out past the spring rolls and rare beef pho but they are both delightful. I have both eaten in and gotten it to go - in the time it takes me to walk over there (6-7 mins) it's waiting for me and since I have ordered the same thing each time (the three times I have asked for it to go as opposed to eating in) they know I want extra hot sauce and paying attention like that is a good indicator of how conscientious they are with the menu/ingredients etc. I say high fives all around."
"Yay!!! This place delivers AND you can place your order online.  Tried them for the first time on a Friday night, delivery took about 45 minutes, perhaps that was because it was a weekend.  Very courteous delivery driver.  I had the pork fried rice, it had a lot of meat and veg, a little bland but soy sauce helped.  Hot and sour soup was good, they let you pick spice level.  I picked medium, it was fairly mild so if you like it nice and spicy bypass the medium option. Will definitely try them again, they have a large menu."
"I still don't see what's so good about the Wynn buffet. The only thing I really enjoyed was the seafood pot pie- shrimp, mussels, potatoes, scallops in a creamy sauce accompanied with a puff pastry. The dessert section is awesome though- with a crepe/waffle bar and a large selection of gelato as well.  Service here however, was horrible. Our server would clear our dishes with our utensils in it and then not bring anymore out to replace them. Were we supposed to get them on our own? IDK. We never got any drink refills either until we flagged him down to ask for one. On top of all this, my dessert plate was cleared away when I hadn't even finished it! I stepped away for one minute to get a waffle and when I came back, my plate along with the untouched candied apple was gone! What a waste. Of course, I had to go back and get another one!"
"The athmosphere is set by relaxing Asian music; simple and traditional service and decor. Loved the tasty chicken and shrimp Pad Thai, and Vietnamese spring rolls... But above all, dining here really feels like traveling...!"
"Do NOT eat here, despite the good reviews, unless you want bugs in your water.  My bf found an INSECT in his glass of water when we had barely started eating. It had wings and everything. When he brought this up with the manager, the manager was rude, failed to apologize, and gave attitude. We had to negotiate to get a refund on the meal, and they were NOT nice about it.  This is actually my 2nd time here, and I would have given them 2-3 stars overall if not for the insect in the drink and the manager's rudeness. Food is overpriced for what it is. ~$40 per person for dinner and food that you can find at almost any $10-15 buffet outside of the strip. At least at the Bellagio you get fancier food like Venison, Osso Bucco, and much better prime rib for your money. Save your money and go to the Bellagio....at least you'll get more bang for your buck and not have to deal with bugs in your water and rude waitstaff."
Paid $60 per person for the dinner buffet the day before Easter Sunday... and apparently still got charged for special Easter pricing... although the buffet food was still the same as any other day.  What really ticked me off... was that half of the servers were rude.  One in particular literally walked away silently... while I was in the middle of speaking to him about my soda which was flat.  Not happy!
"A good bowl of pho that comes out really fast once you've figured out which variation you want. The broth is light but flavorful, noodles are solid, and they do give a good portion of meat for the price. I have a personal preference for tendon, and found their offering of tendons different than the one's I'm use to. Less of the soft gelatinous tendon, and more actual muscle surrounding it. Still good, but different.  Service is fast, efficient and friendly. Obviously a well oiled family operation that keeps a balance between keeping things moving and letting you enjoy a hot meal at your own pace. The space is bright and well lit, and the staff makes an effort to keep the floors dry even on a snowy wet winter day."
"The biscuits and gravy are very good. Greeter was friendly to us and we didn't wait long to be seated at lunch. The food took a while coming out.  The new location is much more spacious and very nicely decorated in that southern style. I would give them 4 stars if service was a bit faster and if our waiter checked on us more and was friendlier. Overall, cool place to eat."
"All around this place was just horrible to live at! Even when you visit the office the staff(four women situated in each corner) will continue whatever gossip and issues they have while you wait standing in the middle of the room. And even when they do get around to you they are always aiming to push you out the door as fast as possible.  The late fee if you are a few hours late on rent? $60!(luckily i was never late) On top of my paying $800 for my crappy one bedroom.  To get to my front door i have to go through three different gates... but security is still a huge issue here, a few of my friends used to live here and they both had there apts broken into.  Whenever my A/C Unit kicks on it starts dripping in the middle of the hall, I know have to leave a bucket underneath it at all times so it doesn't ruin the carpet anymore. The dumpsters are ALWAYS full w/o fail. If you plan on throwing out your trash you either have to be there right after they take it or throw it on the side(in which case people come and pick through it for some reason). My neighbors were a wonderful hispanic family, the wife constantly cooked and would invite me over all of the time. BUT, when she would do the dishes and use the garbage disposal it ended up in all of my sinks and the shower, if i left anything in the sink it would have chunks of whatever they ate the night before. The shower was even worse,(i'm a guy w/ almost no hair, and for some reason the tub manages to have hair in it every morning, along w/ a very nice black film of things that backed up into it)  Maybe i was unlucky w/ this place at every turn and everybody else loves it, but judging the last review i doubt it , I would have avoided this place like the plague if I had known what i would be getting myself into."
This place is definitely in the Top-3 buffet that Vegas has to offer. Their seafood are fresh and the decor is off the hook. Great place.
Started going there since now I live out of town and it's on my way to work. The gas for my car is cheaper. I like that it comes out so fast that you don't have to waste your time waiting forever to pump. The only draw back is that the fumes will make you pass out. There is no cup at the end of the nozzles so you will smell the strong ordor. I haven't tried the convenience store yet so can't comment on that.
"They overcrowd this place FOR SURE. Walking through the main dancefloor was my personal hell: a sweaty mass of bodies pushing and shoving.  It was basically The Human Centipede but 1,000x the people involved: disgusting and unnecessary. Plus, the ""guest list"" line to get in literally went out the building and wrapped around in crazy mazes like you're in line at a theme park, ha!  Thank goodness for bottle service and tables with seating and room to BREATHE. I definitely would not have survived the night otherwise.  Calvin Harris and the novelty of coming to this place for the first time was worth it, though I'm not sure I'd ever return."
"I had lunch at The Buffet. Food was fresh, selection was good, price was okay considering the great atmosphere and quality of the food, service people were very friendly."
Right off the freeway. Great selection of snacks. Fresh coffee and friendly staff. What's not to love?
The titles of the treats sounded so yummy but I was sadly disappointed with the seasonal choice - Strawberry Cheesecake cupcake. It was stale and the frosting tasted more like Crisco from the can. The store decor is super cute and the gentleman working was very nice but he started having a coughing fit as we were leaving. I tried hard to suffer through the cupcake thinking it would get better but finally threw it away less than half way through it. $3.75 and I'm a little nauseous now. Ugh!
I was very disappointed. Panda Express tastes better than Chinese here. For fried chicken I prefer go KFC.
"we really like Barro's.  This one was initially hard to tie down because of a wrong phone number, but the one listed here is correct.   Reliably good, pretty cheap."
"Today I got a hair cut and style with Andrea Paxman at the Sassy Chic Salon in Mesa Arizona. The salon is comfortable, clean, has a funky vibe to it-and there is free water, diet Dr Pepper, and other beverages available while you wait. Which won't be long! Andrea Paxman was on time, polite, listened, gave a great scalp massage during my shampoo and then listened and performed the cut I asked for. The blowout style is included in the price-wait for it...wait for it...no coupon...and the wash/cut/style was $20.00. She includes a two week guarantee on the service so if for some reason you are not thrilled with it-you can come back free of charge for a fixing.  Andrea also designs and sells a variety of clip in hair flowers that vary from  retro chic to little girl girly.  If you need a fresh, fun and hip hair cut-give Andrea Paxman at Sassy Chic Salon a try."
go just to say that you've gone..  we had no lines / no cover - dj was cool - dancefloor was packed.  kinda small and feels cramped  take me back to xs asap
"Pretty worth it if you know how to eat here. My boyfriend on the other hand has wasted his $40 with only plates of fried chicken, some string beans, and some more chicken breast. When you paid $40 for a buffet, you go for the most expensive stuff!! And then fill the cracks and any leftover space in your stomach with what ever else you want to eat.  First off, the staff here is really nice, we sat a small 2 seater table and our dishes never stacked up because they come by pretty frequent to clean out the unwanted dishes. Our waitress also constantly walks over just to check if we needed refills on our drinks.  Onto the food, on my first round, I went for the prime rib, the sea bass, the veal, some pasta, rataloulli. Everything wasn't too bad, typical standard to a buffet. I really liked their prime rib, it was cooked perfectly medium rare each bite wasn't too chewy nor soft like you're eating mush. That only concluded the first half of my adventure to the buffet tables. I continued to the other side where the ""seafood"" section was and I did not touch the sushi at all. Their sushi section was a giant disappointment, it looked worse than places like all-you-can-eat chinese buffets for $10.99. I ignored that section and went straight to the crab legs. What I liked about it was that they saw the crab legs in half already so you can easily just fork out the meat without all the hassle of cracking them open. It was decent, but I quit after 1 plates because it wasn't something I can keep on eating.  The cocktail sauce they had for their shrimp was a little heavy on the horse radish, not sure if it was just that night or if that's how they liked it. So instead, I ate their shrimp and crab as is. They had a cute little dessert room where trays of miniature desserts are placed out. I tried a piece of everything, but of course it was too sweet to finish all of them. I don't even know how to eat the candied apple, how the heck to you bite into that thing?!  The place is designed to be like a tea garden with suspended floral arrangements in the center space and some whimsical decors throughout. It feels a little bit like you're a princess and you're about to have tea with Alice and her wonderland friends except you're chowing down on meat, seafood, and unlimited ice  tea."
The best pizza in Vegas hands down and the best ranch!!    We come here all the time!!
"No wait tonight ! Was pleasantly surprised on a Fri night .  By far arguably the Best buffet in Vegas!  Ribeye was soooo good and the rest of the carvery. The French options were good lamb, quail. Polenta , pizza, the veggie n salad selection bisque galore .  End with delectable dessert crepe !  Oh service and staff were on point! Can't get any better .  Whoa did the yelpers mention the beautiful decor ?"
"My husband bought a groupon. It's a set of three course meals with beer. Overall a OK experience.  The space is small. It was a weekday lunch time. Two tables. Not busy. The waiter was slow. Didn't bring us the soft drink and beer until we waited a while and asked for. They run out of two other regular draft beers, and only IPA left. The waiter offered us an imported beer from Czech. Very refreshing.  The food was just OK. My husband searched a lot of places and finally found clam chowder served in a bread bowl here. We ordered it even though we had payed for enough food. However, it came in a regular bowl without noticing us in advance. They just stopped using the bread bowl. Really a bummer. The chowder coming with crouton had veggie mix which seemed very strange to me. Good amount of clam though.  The calamari was good but not a generous portion compared to other places.  The burgers we had are lobster/beef and foie gras/duck/beef. We both think the meat patty can be more juicy. The flavour was pretty bland, and I even thought to put some slat in. Should be more sauce.  The burger come with soft drink, fries, pickle and red coleslaw. We never got our salad and we didn't realized it until we finished our meal.  The price was OK considering it included a soft drink. Next time maybe I will grab classic burger. This place only opened months ago. I could have been more considerate. It was truly a OK experience. I probably will give it another try."
Busy location so I thought I would try it as I was here from out of town.  Disappointed in guacamole.  1 lb steak burrito was very good and worth the price.   The cocktails looked amazing.
"We had lunch here on a Sunday and I'd describe the food as average .... the menu has options for most, the portions are OK and the food is tasty. Of the fish & chips, Cajun chicken sandwich and burger I think the burger was the winner that day. Sweet potato fries looked amazing. It was very quiet when we were here. It's a casual eatery, they've almost double their size I think - used to be much smaller."
"I wasn't feeling top notch, but the food here was not worth the extra cost. After eating at TI the day before, I expected the Wynn to be along the lines of Bellagio. They do have a large variety, with a strong selection from multiple cuisines: Chinese, American, Indian, Italian. But the food quality was average to above average. The spicy tuna rolls had little tuna and the rice wasn't the best. The shrimp cocktail and smoked salmon were spot on though. The prime rib was good. But the extra price for these premium items didn't seem justified in my opinion. I need to go back to Bellagio to see if it really is the better of the two."
"BEWARE: FOOD POISONING    I was craving Italian food all day, and trying to figure out a place to eat I finally decided upon Sunset Pizzeria. Of course, I should have ordered pizza instead of pasta at a pizza parlor, but regardless I awoke around 10 hours later at about 4:30am running to my toilet and continuing to throw up in the most miserable few minutes of my life, body broke out into a sweat, and 5 minutes later I'm back in bed. I awoke the next morning still feeling horrible the entire day, that I decide to take the food back to them and demand my money back as I do not pay for food that makes me sick!     I have not been sick since I was younger, and I am a light eater, and I literally did not eat anything the entire day except for a bagel in the morning which I always eat.. Naturally when I was throwing up the bagel was long past, and it was only my spaghetti.    Coming back to the place the owner happened to be there, and he tells me that his wife is a nurse and that it takes at least 24 hours to get food poisoning. I can tell you for a fact that is wrong, and this guy is ignorant. People can get food poisoning hours after eating it...Plus, I have a very fast metabolism, and my body processes things faster than normal.. 10 hours is plenty of time for food poisoning to set in. Naturally we get in a shouting match, and there are only about 7-8 people in the restaurant mostly employees and I wish I would of made a video of how bad he looked. I guess he is struggling or times are rough. I suspect that possibly the cook may have done something as well, but I cannot be sure... I am vegetarian, and asked what didn't have meat, and the cook wasn't even sure when asking the hostess over the phone, and it seemed like he was just a hater on vegetarians or something.      I WILL NEVER GO BACK, AND TELL EVERYONE I KNOW HOW HORRIBLE OF AN EXPERIENCE I HAD.    I still taste the Alfredo sauce in my throat with a mix of bile/th**w up. Absolutely disgusting, I've been sick all day like I said. BEWARE!!"
"I lived there for 8 months and had nothing but problems. The carpet was bad, the dish washer doesnt work and it always has water clogged and the maintenance guys never gave a permanant solution. The dish washer stopped working after every 6-7 days.  They also have problem with the internet. Even though we have 40 mbps of speed from quest( the only company the apartments support) the apartments only support 20mbps because of old wiring for the apartment. The gates were always open except for fridays ( wonder what kind of security policy it was). There were cockroaches all over the houses and bed bugs too.. The apartment office people were the most rude people I have ever seen. They also had wierd policies to get out of the lease and heavy fines and they never provide the right details to residents.its 60$ to pay the rent the next day after 1st and 15$ more to pay using a credit card. All that they want is the money and once you pay your rent they never care about any of the isssues. The rent is also very expensive for the crappy apartment full of issues. Never go with Quadrangles apartments, Beware!!"
"Gotta love a place that came up with the best team building idea ever!    Yeah.  you know what I'm talking about.  those ""mandatory fun"" things that companies make their employees suffer through to create ""espirit du corps"" and to have pictures of colleagues painting pottery together. freedom falling together, line dancing, anyway- you know what I'm talking about.  So imagine my surprise and delight when this year's corporate team building activity was a drink competition between the various teams as we had to create a new cocktail with the liquors  and mixers provided and then the chef and head bartender would judge the winning concoction!    Talk about fun!  First we're drinking for a couple of hours to try to see what we wanted to make, and then we not only get to taste our teams drink but the other team's drinks as well.  Clearly the best ""mandatory fun"" I've ever participated in.  And then we got to eat some of the specialty items off of the Tommy Bahama menu.  For appetizers- the coconut shrimp and goat cheese skewers were quite good.  for my entree, I had a  pounded chicken served with potatoes that was delicious and for dessert, the pina colada cake was a decadent indulgence.  The decor is beachy, you can buy a Magnum PI shirt on the main floor and many of the drinks come with flowers in them.  But say what you want cuz Tommy Bahama's is okay in my book.  Afterall- they let me concoct my own new drink . . .we named it the Western Sunset.  I'm guessing you'll see it on a menu there soon!"
"Guys, nothing negative to say about service, but the food selection is beyond poor. I guess I probably set my standards far up after staying at Aria hotel my last visit to Vegas. Aria has the best service and Buffett in Vegas. Not coming back to the Wynn."
"Waffles were good.  Chicken was good but not as good as at the sister restaurant, Mrs. White's.  Service wasn't very good.  Great cultural experience."
"What a gorgeous and fun store!  Beautiful cakes and cookies with an assortment of tempting gift items making it very easy to separate you from your cash.  Our server was very helpful and even warmed our cookies for us.  We had a white on white cupcake, a snickerdoodle and a white chocolate/raspberry cookie.  All looked delicious (albeit pricey) but were so dry that instructions for the Heimlich Maneuver should be posted on the wall.  What a disappointment!!  Does the owner or any of the help ever eat their product?  I would head right back to the kitchen and tweak my recipes so everything would taste at least half as good as it looked.  Sad to say but I doubt there will be many repeat customers.  Just a lot of ""one and done"" taste testers."
"Went here on Memorial Day weekend.... It was CROWDED. That was to be expected though, we were on the guest list and we waited in line for over an hour. It was around 11pm so maybe the line thinned out later in the night. I was super excited to go here because it was so anticipated by everyone in Vegas. I feel like I would have had a lot more fun if there wasn't a million people there... The dance floor was smaller than I imagined it to be, being the largest club in Vegas but I only was in the room Tiesto was dj-ing in. The other rooms might be bigger/less crowded. So I would say that my first impression is that it was okay, but ill probably wait a while to again so it's less crowded and I can actually get to the dance floor and actually make it to the bar without getting trampled. I also do want to come back to see Calvin Harris. The club is also a really far walk from the parking structure so be prepared to walk."
It's 1 pm on a Saturday and they are out everything! No ribs not pulled pork so chicken or hamburger boring very disappointing in sitting at the table with no food because of how slow they are! Never ever will go here again! Manager thought it was funny!
"I came here for the first time yesterday after being super disappointed with the nail salon next door a few weeks back. I was seated on time and the customer service was great. They were very nice. Loss of stars for massage chair (one of the worst I have ever sat in) and the price (over $80 with tip for gel mani and pedi with callus remover). Unfortunately there just isn't a nail salon in this immediate area that is very good. I will say that the nail tech next to me was doing some pretty intricate designs on a lady. Impressive, but I'm pretty simple."
Great service and terrific beer selection.   Food is average to good.  No wifi!!  Need to get it to compete.
"I made a yelp account just to write a bad review about this place.  I am not a food connoisseur by any standards.  I absolutely love Panda Express, Pei Wei, and even love most cheap, dirty, less than flavorful Chinese dives.    This place is just awful.  The Orange Chicken tastes bland, overcooked, and, despite feeling starved, has been thrown in the trash.  I thought that was as bad as it could get before I tried the Lo Mein.  It looks charred and dirty, and tastes like it had been half cooked in rotten month old oil.  My coworker's General Tso's Chicken does not look better and apparently doesn't taste it either.  What I love most is that I waited an hour and a half for the food and shelled out $23 between me and one co-worker (we didn't even order drinks...).  The gentleman on the phone barked orders at me to the point where I wasn't even mad, just confused.  Words seriously cannot describe the intense dissatisfaction I am feeling.  In all seriousness, I don't know how anybody in their right mind could EVER write anything better than a one star review about this place.  Get in your 200 degree car and drive down to Jack in the Box.  The risk of heat exhaustion is well worth the pain you'll save having to choke down this North Korean jail food."
"Edible, affordable, decent service. Brown rice and a source of protein. I'm not sure that I would come back here in the future, but in a pinch, it'll do."
Zero stars!!! To begin with you know customer service is the most important thing in a resort and this resort has no customer service!!! Second it is a waist of time to book a reservation because they don't give you what they promise! Third my swimming pool at home is bigger than the one they have here!! This resort treats their visitors like crap and end up ruining your vacation to Vegas!! The price is not worth the bad treatment!! Alot of people recomend this place cause they have no self worth and are blind to reality!!!!!!!!! Don't waist your time with this place they will only ruin your Vacation!! They lie and say that you can use the swimming pool at the cosmopolitan resort.  It is a lie.  The place smells and to get to the parking area is hard to find.  No valet service and parking lot is far away from the entrance.
"Love the food here! But definitely not professional when someone calls to order and the employees answer ""HELLO"" instead of "" Thank you for calling susnset pizzeria"" my immediate response was "" Is this sunset puzzeria????""..  Night staff needs to get trained on how to answer phones!"
Every time I visit my friends in Mesa I force them to take me to Tommy's.  They never disappointment me.  Love everything I drink and eat here.  I also love to shop downstairs.
"We actually came here twice, once for dinner, and again for lunch. We really liked dinner so we were actually hoping that lunch would something different and good too, but it was really the same food so the second time was a little disappointing, mostly because we wanted some new stuff. That being said, we did come a second time because we really liked their food and atmosphere, service is alright and there wasn't too much of a line either times that we went. So to the foods:  Peking duck has too much Hoisin so you should probably ask for it on the side if you want it. Crab legs were good, they're cut in half so it's easier to eat. Tuna ceviche was good the first time we went, though tasted like it'd been sitting out too long the second. Fried turkey was GOOOD. Like really. Go get it. Beef shanks was good according to the bf, I'm not much of a red meat person. Prime rib was also REALLY good according to the people we went with. Corn with lime chili was yummy but I really just like corn.   I don't remember what else but there's a whole room for desserts!! And an ice cream guy too. Lots of cookies and normal stuff though, nothing to rave about.  Oh and dinner was around 40 and lunch was 26 I think"
"I have been taking my rescue dog to Dr. Hechko and staff for a few years now and the care received is above and beyond. I had a bad experience with a prior vet and have become quite over protective with special girl. They are very understanding and patient with me and always take the time to answer my questions and reassure me. Whenever we go there we are greeted by a friendly staff and clean facility. It is one stop shopping-vet services, lab work, xrays, grooming and play area. They also hold special event a few times a year for the pets which is really a nice treat. The pet and the owner are treated with respect and appreciation and that is really what counts."
"I have been using Manning Sprinkler Services for 17 years. They are always timely, professional and efficient. It is easy to complain about bad service; there's plenty of it here in Phoenix.  Not enough people applaud good customer service. I highly recommend Manning Sprinkler Services."
"Yelp elite Vicky V has the truly amazing job if event organiser for this wonderful and cosy venue, tucked away on thistle street, close to where it crosses Frederick street, in Edinburgh's trendy new town.   Tonight's event was a brilliant drag themed, ceramic painting workshop. Part of a long goodbye to our CM Jody who will be crossing the pond in just four weeks (cue the violins!).  The venue, complete with disco ball lighting, and a play list that will keep you dancing until the wee hours, is also host to to weaving, silk knicker making, and resin worships, to name just a few. Check out their website and get booked in!"
"Blah, bland, flavorless pulled chicken. Needs bar b que sauce to make it edible. Brisket was probably boiled as well. Corn on the cob was mooshy. Mashed potatoes were of the instant flavor variety.. Service was friendly. Won't eat here again."
"At first glance, it looks like upscale, quality dining in the United terminal of McCarran.  Looks can be deceptive.  Really, Burke is greasy, overpriced, and one of the few food choices without having to endure a long haul down another terminal walkway.   The margherita pizza was tasty, but tasty didn't come without being mega greasy.  That pizza was the sole reason that I fell asleep on my noon flight after a night of 7 hours of slumber and an hourlong nap on my first connection.   Food coma much?"
"The food was good but after being at the Naples location there was no comparison. Naples has it hands down on the setup - with the fabulous live entertainment, larger patio area with an open access to the restaurant where the bar is just blows Scottsdale out of the water and I believe the food is one notch better as well."
"HIGH HEELS CHECKED, GUESTLIST CHECKED  We were told by the promotor to come STRICTLY at 930pm so the girls could get in for FREE and the guy need to pay $30-$50 because of MARTIN GARRIX special performance.   I told all of my friends to MAKE SURE everyone to come STRICTLY at 930pm. Little that I know that all of my friends had their own things to do in Vegas. Some were gambling, drinking and about to get into fight. Some were about to cry over the boyfriend. Some wanted to sleep in the car. And me? I just run to take shower at the hotel and dress up and then apparently get lost and couldn't make u-turn to MGM hotel (where Hakkasan is).  So basically,  we only have 10 minutes to arrive in Hakkasan! 1 friend hasn't changed dress yet because apparently her dress is in my car! Gosh! So, I pulled my car at 3D parking structure for her to jump in and changed at back seat. Then we had to run with our high heels to Hakkasan to catch that 930pm slot.  Sure enough, we run to the wrong direction which is Train Station (second floor of MGM) (?)   By the time we were arrived at guestlist area, it was 935pm and weird thing was we were the FIRST one in line! We were told that it's opened at 1030pm. So since we were the first guest, the guys get in for FREE too. Yay!!   Place is Moderately Big. 2 rooms (hip-hop and EDM). Smoking area next to hip-hop room. Drink is same as West Hollywood standard price.  People dress-up in here: suit and dress.   Much fancier than WeHo club, especially the bottle service,  instead of only LIGHTS, they pulled some stunts by marching bands, rhino girls, bathing robe girls, dragon cage and many more. Interesting!!!  Martin Garrix himself super cute and talented. They kept spraying us with cold gas and showering with many papers.   Super fun with great songs.  A night to remember."
"So my review is based on the service not the food! I would give a 4 based on food, our waitress was absolutely horrible. She never introduced herself to our table of 4 , did not check on our food , took our leftovers away (which we wanted) and threw them out, did not ask if we wanted desert , did not bring water promptly, had to ask for things multiple times , and even acting annoyed that she was waiting on my family.  On top of that she took forever to bring out check.   The food was very tasty , however I have not been to a restaurant with this bad of service in Scottsdale in a long time. Will not be returning."
"My first experience was probably the worst Starbucks experience I ever had. Not to mention I visit Starbucks every single day. It took them three times to get my drink correct and they made me feel like I was in trouble when I told them it was wrong. I paid for a Carmel drizzle and didn't receive one. Me and a few others were sitting waiting for our drinks and the woman working was rinsing the metal milk steamers and we all got splashed in the face with water. She just walked away and didn't even say sorry.  I hate giving low reviews but I am actually upset, that was terrible!  Visited again today and my Starbucks double shot was 100% milk, it was awful!"
"My stylist Daisy was absolutely the best ! She took the time to listen to what I wanted, and she made sure that we both were on the same page BEFORE she started anything. Her personality was so great, very down to earth and made me feel at ease . I read some reviews on her and trust me it's all true! Keep up the good work Daisy! Stylist like her are hard to find, go see her you won't regret it . Much love"
"My lease was up and needed help moving out kind of last minute. I found Dignity Moving on Facebook so I called them. I spoke to Daniel who gave me a reasonable price, and was flexible with the date. They were there on-time and moved quick and efficient! Really impressive men!! They stuck true to the price; I paid cash since they have a 5% processing fee for card transactions. Would definitely recommend!!"
"The lunch buffet was $26.99 and I feel for the price it was a good value, considering it was in the Wynn hotel/casino and considering prices for restaurants on the strip.  There was a huge spread of food and it was great.  The service was ok, albeit a bit slow.  The waitress was friendly, but we didn't see much of her throughout our meal."
We always get great service. Recently I needed my clothes cleansed asap and I was easily accommodated.  My clothes always look and smell great. I highly recommend Oxford Cleaners. Thank you for always providing exceptional service and quality.
"after reading the yelp reviews, my bf decided that we should all eat at wynn's buffet becas its the ""best buffet in vegas!!..according to yelp"" sigh.. the wait was pretty long (about 30 mins or more) and and prices were outrageous! im not sure if it was a holiday price or something but for 2 adults it was about $108 0_0. after paying that much i expected the food to be great but it was just ehh..ive had better at way lower prices.  majority of the foods had weird names, i guess theyre trying to be fancy? and not much of the food looks that appealing.  the taste of the food was just average and the service was average. for $108 a couple, the food shouldve been bomb. period."
Last evening June 10 th I  was a guest at the Beso  Steakhouse was visiting from out of town with some very special friends. I was there for work for a couple of days. This evening was put aside to share with friends and have a nice relaxing dining experience. This was not a memorable experience at all. First of all for all of us to decide on a restaurant with such high prices and great location you would think the meal would be outstanding at all. Our reservation was at 8 . we arrived on time and the restaurant was empty. About 5 tables were full. The decor nice facing the aria fountains. The music a bit loud. Well we started with a cocktail order from Paul. Nice guy friendly funny. Our drinks after flagging down someone came  to the table 40 minutes later with an apology 2 to 3 times. We ordered our meal and the food was OK. My halibut was awful. Crusted halibut as dry can be. Awful taste first bite. I had my boyfriend try it as well. It took some time before we could flag down our waiter Paul again. He seemed very flustered when I told him. Paul put another order in. The second order was worse than the first.raw and a pile of salt thrown on.this time the dish arrived wen my friends were already finished with their meal.then we were told a special desert was coming out. I had told our waiter it was my boyfriends birthday.ok now no surprise. The deserts looked amazing with no candle. I mentioned please bring a candle after the deserts arrived. Paul went back and said oh right oh right. He returned with 2 candles on a plate burning was like what the heck! The candles weren't even put into the desert! this experience was a joke but not a joke on our pocket book. After 300 dollars later .
"We were told by my best friends ""wife-to-be"", on his bachelor weekend to go here. And that's how my story begins. Let me also mention that this was hopefully a clear indication to my friend about how the rest of his life story begins as well.   So we got dressed after a long day at the Marquee Day club with some girlfriends from Santa Monica, who were in town for a bachelorette party. A great coincidence for us. Anyway, we were starving and could not wait to tear down some exquisite pieces of the finest animal flesh a bunch of cave men could inhale. We filled up 4 private taxi's and off we went.   The place is nicely dressed and that's about the extent of the good parts. The service was decent considering that the place wasn't even packed, the food was bland, and good drinks are everywhere nowadays. We drank, we ate, we laughed, looked cool, and left.   Beso's is not a place I would come back to again, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone for any reason, and I don't mean that in a mean way. Just as honest as possible. I actually will never brag nor mention having been there to anyone. The only reason I even considered writing about it is because, I may actually help someone save well earned cash.   There are a lot better places to eat at for atmosphere, and/or, for actual well prepared food in Vegas. At least for the money you will spend here.   3 stars is actually 2.5, and that's because we had a blast either way."
"Ran into a promoter who offered out group of girls a free bottle and table. Had to send a picture of ourselves to him in order to be confirmed for the table.   Arrived at about 10:30 pm. Was able to reach the promoter right away and he took is directly into our table in the hip hop area. The place filled up quick. Glad we had a table or there wouldn't be a place to dance. Its a big club but gets quite crowded.   Tried to go to the trance area upstairs where tiesto was playing, but it was way too crowded. Ended up finishing our bottle and back to the casino for gambling."
Shamika is amazing! I was so nervous to get my hair colored again. Over the years I've been pretty adventurous with color and my hair was so damaged because of it. So I hadn't colored my hair for over a year. I was getting bored with it but was so nervous. Shamika did such a great job! She took real good care of my hair and the color is phenomenal! I've never had better color before. I'll keep going back to her.
"Holy antiques--lots of 'em. In four different houses.  So much so that's it's a little overwhelming, but still an adventure at the same time. Heck, they even had some newer stuff!   This isn't the place to find something for a steal. I mean, there were a few things that were cheaper, but most everything I thought I could find for less at my go-to thrift spots. This is somewhere to find a true gem, though--just expect to pay full buck.   I also have a little problem with places like this due to sensory overload. There's so much cool stuff that it's hard to for that really special pick to jump out at you. I really couldn't decide what to buy and/or if it was worth it. Therefore, I left with nothing.   But, I think I should go back with a change of attitude and maybe a better idea what I am looking for. Until then, I can't wait to come back and scrounge threw these goodies again! It's a hike, but totally worth the drive to check it all out.  Note that they do fully follow their $10 minimum charge rule."
"This place is consistently busy.  We keep coming back because the soups are not laden with MSG.  The broth is not as flavourful as I would like it, though.  The portions and prices are reasonable for downtown pho and bun.  It's also seemingly cleaner than other Vietnamese restaurants.  The renos sure made a big difference."
"A real disappointment. The service was slow, our waiter was annoyingly arrogant, food was very average (tuna was accompanied with potatoes in a tomato purée and some kind of spice that didn't match very well) and it was over priced. Tacky decor too. Don't waste your time."
"If you're standards do not rise above that of a run down Holiday Inn this place would be fine. Unfortunately for the Jockey Club I have traveled extensively and stayed in some of the better hotels and resorts the world has to offer. For the record though, I have stayed in hotels in Europe/Italy that are held to an entirely different (lower) standard than the U.S. that I would happily stay in again before I spent another night at the Jockey Club.  My exact words to describe this hotel I could not post, lets just suffice it to say it's the first time I couldn't wait for my vacation to end.  I am a timeshare owner and traded an ocean front unit at a five star gold crown resort in Cabo San Lucas for the week I had at the Jockey Club, I received a second floor room with a view of the concrete wall of the Cosmopolitan and sewer pipes (along with the smell) coming from the first floor of the Jockey Club. I immediately contacted the front desk upon entering the room but was told there was nothing they could do for me. I spent two days trying to contact Lori Elie the ""resort manager"" but was consistently told she was out of the office. I finally left a voicemail for her explaining my complaints, I left her my room number and cell number but my call was never returned. There is no doubt I could have paid rack rates for the room I had and spent less money than it cost to pay the maintenance fee for the week I traded. This place is a dump....the smell of the ""mini market"" took me back to a mom and pop corner store in Mexico (which I love mind you....IN MEXICO!!) Unfortunately the prices (A six pack of Budweiser was $13) were enough to shock me back to reality and realize I was just in a dump in Vegas. The ""walkway to the strip"" is about 100 yards of a dark smelly alleyway that is used for delivery trucks (its also the main entrance to the Jockey Club) and apparently time share salesmen that are are ready and willing to take advantage of unhappy people leaving the Jockey Club. We were approached in the alley by a guy that worked for another timeshare hotel, apparently the catch phrase is...""how do you like the jockey club"" then when you begin to tell them they offer to put you up in their hotel for a mere ""90 minute presentation"" The concierge for the Jockey Club happened to walk out the door, noticed what was going on and a screaming and yelling match between the two ensued, apparently they are well aware of the inferiorities of the Jockey Club (JC) and threatened by the prospect of losing guests, we just walked away. We tried to go to the ""spa"" one day to try and maybe salvage something good from this place, we attempted to sit in the jacuzzi but the chlorine level was so high it immediately burned our eyes, we opened the door that encloses the jacuzzi to try to get some fresh air just so we could stay in the room but soon after getting in noticed our skin was either being bleached or chemically burned. (not sure which) We then went to the pool which was cold (mind you the JC is surrounded by tall buildings, or as they like to say ""nestled"" and barely see's the light of day. The liner of the pool was blue, but the bottom was brown, pretty sure it wasn't made that way, I have seen much nicer pools at a holiday inn. The ""view"" of the Bellagio they tout is only obtained from the upper floors on one side of course and I suspect the only ones remodeled and reserved only for those who are most likely to purchase a timeshare, otherwise you're view is of a wall or the ""walkway to the strip""...a dark alley. I'm guessing I got the room I got because I am already a timeshare owner and I declined to attend the ""owners meeting"" for those of you not familiar, that's where they try to get you to buy another timeshare or upgrade the one you have. The JC should have taken the offer from The Cosmopolitan so they could have torn it down and made better use of the property. If you're going to Vegas on a budget stay downtown at the Golden Nugget, I have stayed there a few times and it looks and feels like the Ritz Carlton compared to this place....really."
Honestly I wasn't expecting this place to have very good food but I was pleasantly surprised.  The hot bread they served came with a nice honey butter that I think had specks of nutmeg in it.  I loved it.    Ahi Tuna Tacos and a glass of mimosa to start off the day.  For lunch I had a steak salad that was prepared with just the right amount of dressing. The shiitake mushrooms were crunchy which made each bite an interesting one.  It was a lovely day and we sat out on the patio.    Bartender took great care of us.  Apparently there was a backup in the kitchen and he seemed to notice before we did.  Now that's what I call attentive.
"Review based on a COMP dinner: It was really nice inside the restaurant and the service was good. We were a party of 12 hungry girls going in and 12 girls still hungry when we left. Couldn't really expect to be full when the meal is free at a nice restuarant. The meal included guac and chips, tacos, and churros. The food was good but portions are very tiny, check pictures to see size. I would come back here when I have more money so I can actually try the food that is offered on the menu :)"
Nice place to grab a bite before your flight.
"This club had a great DJ for a Sunday the music mix had a little of everything that seemed to please everyone in the club including myself . We contacted a promoter out here so all four of us (2girls & 2guys ) got in for free !! They also had Promo for ladies to get two free greygoose drinks before midnight !! Thank goodness for that because the prices are true to Vegas lol , one sprite & a vodka cranberry cost $25 , 1 figi water was $10 and it was the mini bottle !! So if you have money to drop its a good club to visit after you see KA which I seen most do ! The restroom attendants where friendly and the bouncers didn't seem pushy but the bar tenders in my eyes felt they thought to highly of themselves ! I feel there is to many bouncers it's not like there was Celebrity there and they are all contracted so they are wasting that extra money for no reason and a lot of them didn't seem like they knew what to do , but than again they have like 8 entry's to the club so I doubt that helps ."
"I am originally from up north where the chinese food is typically much better so I may be different then someone from charlotte having chinese and never tasted anything better but this place is really bad. There entrees are pretty much unedible. The only things they have that are ok is there appetizer stuff. Basically anything pre made and fried like crab rangoons etc. However, even this stuff is sub par. I seriously do not recommend this place at all."
"Barro's is the best pizza in the valley, and a local chain that made good!  This is a newer and cleaner Barro's than i've been used to going to, so points for that.  The fake brick walls kind of close in on you, so I advise not to ingest any hallucinogens prior to your coming in."
"Staff here are very nice. I love that they dispense cutlery in a warm glass for sanitation. Their pho is good, but other foods are very questionable. The atmosphere is nice but then also plain and petite."
So ever since hakkasan was announced to open I had been anticipating on it being the best club Vegas has ever seen. I finally made it out last Sunday and I have to say it lived up to its expectations. Our host Ulysses was excellent and was the reason the whole night amazing. We were treated like VIP's from the beginning until   the club closed (which the girls didn't like). Everyone in our group agrees we will be back very soon. Only gripe we had was it was kind of dead but other than that it was excellent.
"wanted some good snacks went to beso for the appetizers and it was horrible. the strip steak taco were cold, the beans were cold,  we order the paella which looked like jalapeno popper the outside was warm but the center was cold. the octopus was marinated nicely, the server  hardly asked us if we were enjoying are meal spent most of his time hitting on the two ladies next to us. . .  i expected better for a place on the strip."
"We usually like Barros so I took my family over a couple of weeks ago for an evening meal.  My daughter is sensitive to gluten, so we ordered a gluten free pizza, regular pizza and wings.  Their regular pizza was good as always.  The gluten-free however, came out with the crust burned.  I tasted the edge of it and it tasted as burned as it looked.  I took it back and was told that's just the way it is with gluten-free.  Since I ordered meat on the pizza, they had to make sure it was cooked so the crust gets burned.  That's it - no offer to make it better, just go ahead and eat it.  So I wasn't happy about that, but to make matters a little more annoying, I could hear the teenage server talking to someone in the back (the cook I'm guessing) and making some smart-alec remark about my complaint. That's cool I guess, but FYI - it's a pretty small store and I can hear you out by the cash register Einstein.  The wings were OK, but very wet.  Oh, and they don't have any wet-wipes, so you just have to go through about 20 disintegrating napkins while eating your wet wings.  So, 4 stars overall for the pizza, minus 2 stars for the crappy service and smart-alec high school servers.  I'll just stick to Sardellas, who apparently have already taken the class on how to make gluten-free pizza."
"Fourth update... The shower was fixed and they left with a blue stain on our bathroom counter and sewage water in our bathroom.  Now our toilet is leaking.  In the year I have lived here I think this is the 11th maintenance issue we have had, not to mention the roaches infesting the place and such... Basically we pay about $1,100/month for unsanitary, unlivable conditions and I plan to bring it up to them ASAP, this place is run like a halfway house, it's despicable.    Third update... They sent the dry wall guy in before the plumber...so after an hour of him working he concluded he couldn't fix it because there was still a leak...uh-noduh!  So that night the plumber comes in at 8 pm until 9:30 pm... Then today the dry wall guy came back and started working. My favorite part was when he took his dirty rags and left them on our couch. Supposedly the painters will come tomorrow. We shall see. It's been 1 1/2 weeks, send help ;)  (Masking my rage with humor-it's a coping mechanism when you're paying $1,100/month for a cockroach infested, broken down apartment with horrid management)"
"They did great on my hair,  knew exactly wanted and was able to achieve the look I desired. I am definitely happy with the service provided"
This was close to our hotel in Henderson. Besides a small mixup on our order it was very good. We ordered 2 pizzas a chicken Cesar salad and a Philly cheese steak. The Philly was better than I was expecting. Pizzas were cooked well and had good flavor. Will try again I'm sure before we leave town.
Came to here to see Julie..one of my favorite bar tenders...unfortunately she had the day off..so Carl had helped us. He was great. Fun and full of energy and kept the drinks flowing... 3rd time around of having a great experience at Tommy Bahamas!!!!
"Wonderful venue for group dinner.  Started with a Mai Tai on the patio watching the sunset through the palms and listening to live music from the guitarist.  Next was coconut shrimp apps. Fantastic! Service never let either my water or wine glass go empty...and I really tried to challenge them with both!  Had Thai shrimp and scallops for main. Curry was very light, and made a perfect pairing with the seafood.  Some sort of tropical cake dessert...coconut and pineapple. Again light and refreshing."
"I loved the selection they carried and was beyond stoked on ordering from them. However, they mailed out my order to the incorrect address and didn't have any tracking to see where it ended up. When I contacted them about it, I was told they couldn't resend it or refund me until they got it back. I wouldn't know if they did or not cause of the lack of tracking, either way, it never got to me.  I understand their not wanting to lose money, but my purchase was only $50 and taking my word for it and replacing the items would have made me rave about the store even more. Working for a small business myself, I know the value of retaining a customer and making them hyped on wanting to go back over and over.   Maybe the package will show up, but it's been over 3 months so I doubt it. I recommend they start using tracking for all orders, worth it to keep their customers and their company more accountable.   Otherwise, their stuff is rad. Just bummed over the shipping to the U.S. experience."
"This place is quick.  The food is not as consistent as I'd like.  Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's so so.  I do wish the telephone operators to perk up a little bit, I mean- words are free - I'm not paying by the word so please use them freely and lead a friendly conversation as I'm ordering to give you my money  :-)"
"Your average bar and food destination.  Good service, but not too different (food and drink wise) from other places."
When this place first opened it was great.  Now it's like everything has been sitting in the case for a couple days and it's not as fresh.  They also have the same offerings all the time and there isn't anything new.
If I could choose zero stars I sure would. Came to move in & the whole kitchen was flooded with raw sewage. Drove here from California to move our son into an apt for school. No other apts available but the parking lot is empty. Do not recommend this place. Terrible service in leasing office as well.
"Ordered a crab meat with udon noodle in soup.  It's okay, but nothing special."
"THIS IS A REPLY TO PAT!!! You knew those purses were not real!! How can you call yourself a high end resale boutique and not know the difference between a real COACH bag and a fake one! If you post that they were real again I'm going to report you to the state consumer affairs,"
"A slightly more upscale Vietnamese Restaurant located at Jane and Wilson.  SLIGHTLY UPSCALE The patrons coming in wore $400 pair of jeans, business men in tidy suits, utensils giving to you in boiling hot water (we asian people like to know things are clean), walls were nicely decorated, and it was clean.  FOOD  The food was nothing special. Same typical vietnamese food.   I had #19 (seafood and assorted meat egg noodle) on the menu (see picture) since this place is famous for it.  The meat was actually very tasty. I believe it was ox liver? Usually though, i'm not a fan of liver.  The serving was large and I took about 1/2 home. (But then again, I only eat a small for pho)  My friend had #20, seafood egg noodle soup. He really liked it.   They gave us the traditional garnishes such as red hot chili peppers.  COSTS This place is a tad more expensive than the traditional Pho restaurants.  My meal and my friend's meal each cost $7.25.  I was a bit stunned about the price of the avocado shakes. They were $4 each and they came in such a small cup (took a peek at the neighbours table, so not sure what they tasted like).  SERVER The food took longer to get to us than at other pho places I've been to. It could perhaps be the they had to fry my little shrimp.  But the server had our menu, tea, and utensils as soon as we sat down.  She took our order quickly too.  The place is pretty good.  But I'm still not sure if the premium prices were completely justified at this Pho restaurant.  But then again, the prices are a lot less than if you were to go to most other type of restaurants so try this one out!"
"I hate to be a hater but this buffet doesn't live up to the hype.   The floor manager was kind enough to help flag down servers who were horribly inattentive. I would be empathetic if it was Sunday brunch but on a Tuesday night... they need to get it together.   All I really wanted was crab legs and champagne.   Of the four legs I piled on my plate, one was completely frozen! Not to mention that the butter was scalding hot. I suffered a first degree burn trying to pour some into a container. (Slightly exaggerated but they did start pouring butter from a different container after a number of complaints.)  Champagne was a great deal at $10 unlimited for pretty good bublly but having to flag down a server every time I needed a refill was annoying. Not once was I asked if I wanted more.   I moved on from crab to lamb chops and was pleasantly surprise. They were marinated and absolutely eat-until-you-puke delicious. I did get scolded by the chef when I accidently dropped two because they slipped out of the tongs. --Not sure what's up with the back sass but things would be better if they worked on that. Slippery food + smooth tongs = disaster.    Nothing else is worth mentioning.   I'm going to listen to Sal S. and try Bellagio."
"Well this place did not live up to the hype I've heard and read about.  The selection was ok and variety was not nearly as good as my top ranked caesars buffet.  They do however do a nice job of presentation, the layout and cleanliness is top notch."
"Stopped by  few weeks ago for the first time in years and I can say I wasn't disappointed. Spent a lot of time there in the past seeing bands perform upstairs. This last visit was also due to an event held upstairs; a fundraiser for refugees. The staff was so accommodating, the drinks were flowing and the food was as good as I remembered."
"For the price and the class of the hotel, this buffet was a bit of let-down. I didn't get the high class quality I had at the Bellagio or Cosmopolitan buffet.   They had crab legs, only cold ones, in a messy pile. I've had warm steamed ones at  much lower level buffet restaurants. Sushi seemed to have been refrigerated for a while. I didn't like the taste of coffee for some reasons, but I guess I'm just too picky.  Tables were crammed in. I felt like I was sitting at a food court, sort of.   Overall foods taste all good, but I give this buffet the same grade as Mirage's Cravings, which is much cheaper."
"Went here with a group of friends in November. One of the friends got some hookup so we didn't pay to get in and VIP line pass. So couldn't complain about paying a cover charge or waiting forever in a line. The club itself is pretty huge. We surveyed about 3 floors. The look was pretty cool throughout. The house DJ list is impressive too. Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Steve Aoki & Deadmau5. Each floor having its own decor, theme & DJs. Two serious downsides were that it was packed like a sardine can in there. Also the stairs are KILLER. There's only a few elevators so the main route of travel inside the club is taking flights of stairs. I can imagine it's even more a nightmare when one is drunk & wearing high heels. Frankly I'm shocked no ones gotten seriously hurt and/or sued Hakkasan for dangerous conditions. One person is our group did lose her purse. When she called the next day, fortunately they had it at the club intact. Apparently she had left it at one of the bars after ordering some drinks & the bartender saw it and turned it in. Like all clubs on the strip. It's no fun if you're not on the list and pay full price after waiting in a line for hours. Always a good idea to get some type of hookup or deal thru a club host or casino or such."
Took king size comforter to wash it.  Commercial washers did a great job.  They were working on new countertops and folding tables when In as there.  Like the large capacity washers even though they were $6.50 per wash.
"Visited on Wednesday. It was my 3rd visit and my partners 5th. We compared notes on our walk home and can't figure out why we keep going back. Each time we have taken home a variety of goods. Separately we've tried brownies, cookies, cupcakes, cakes pops and most recently shared a cake in a jar. For both of us the brownies and cookies lack flavor. The cupcakes are beautiful but I have yet to find one that taste as good as it looks. We have also received cupcakes that seemed hard on multiple occasions. The cake in a jar that we shared wasn't fresh at all. On the plus side - The cake pops were the most tasty treat I tried at the bakery. I've had better but out of my purchases they were the best. Each time we've visited we have had great customer service. The decor is super cute and the display cakes are gorgeous. But the main reason we would visit is to find something yummy and I don't feel like I can do that at this bakery."
Well what can I say that everyone in the world doesn't already know about Starbucks. If you thought you were going to get strong coffee for a strong price. Then guess what? Your right. The decor and coffee is the same as the other bazillion Starbucks. Yay corporate coffee!
"By far my favorite buffet in Vegas. Yes, the 2 hour wait was painful. Watching people get the delicious food while your tummy is empty could be a killer. This buffet can appeal to everyone with different preferences in food. Once we were seated, I went straight for the seafood station. King crab legs and shrimp were fresh and nicely prepared. Compared to the other three buffets we tried during the trip, Wynn is elegant, but worth every penny you pay. Dessert was a splurge when I already had food up to my throat. If it's your first trip to Vegas, make sure you give this place a try."
"So let's not go overboard but this is a fresher choice for food than most. It's a Mongolian Grill with more limited options.   I went for the island teriyaki bowl. Good portion. Fresh chicken. But a little too much of  pineapple which overwhelmed the dish. But I enjoyed having this option and its a good option in an airport.   But truth be told, I'd probably go for the BBQ next door if I only had one choice."
"We only came here for drinks, so I can't speak for the food. They have a lot of different options and the drinks are cheap. The location is also great being right down town.  For a cheap beer, I have no problem at all with this place. They do separate checks which is great."
"this wood shack has been in tempe for as long as i can remember and i've probably been.. two times, maybe three? for as much as everyone swears by these burgers, i thought they were just ok. it's served and order counter style, so it's very casual -and very busy at lunch time during the week. nothing in particular to complain about, just didn't wow me."
"Im kinda torn about the Wynn Buffet. The quality of all the food i tried was good. Everything was nice and fresh and tasty. However nothing really jumped at me as being ""WOW"".    King Crab - Maybe im spoiled by live King Crab, it didnt have the sweetness of live ones but its a buffet, quantity over quality  Roast Beef - Perfect Medium Rare, needed some salt though  Lamb - Same as the beef, needed salt  Sushi - Pass  Other Foods - Good, nothing really stood out though  Deserts - Too sweet for me  Service was good, refilled drinks quickly. The atmosphere was really nice and casual. There wasnt the usual buffet atmosphere. It was a calm dining experience.  However since im not really a buffet person, i'll come if people want to but I rather use that money on the buffet for a round of drinks!"
When in Vegas this is a must. We went when Lil Jon was the deejay he had the place lit. Great atmosphere and great music only complaint would be the drinks are a bit pricey but thats Vegas for you. I definitely recommend
"As did a lot of my fellow Yelpers, I checked out the reviews of this place - but we were already seated when I did because it was the nearest restaurant to our gate.  To be honest, the reviews I read had me a bit worried but I know that each patron has their own experience and every business can have its ""off"" days.  Today was not one of those, really.  We were flying through on New Year's Day and I actually felt bad for our server...because she was the only server.  But I tell you what, she did a great job considering how full the restaurant was!  Her name was, I think, Kanesha.    It's a seat-yourself establishment and they have these neat little transponders on the tables with 3 buttons:  request service, request check, or cancel request.  We pushed the request service button quite a few times, not actually sure if was working or not because no one was coming to our table.  But after we observed this nice lady run all over the place, we realized she was the only server working.  She came to our table and took our orders right away.  Given the stress she  had to be under, she was extremely pleasant and very efficient!  Our drinks came out very fast as did our food!  Which was a real surprise.  We probably sat down, ordered, and received our food in 30 minutes or less.  If I could give this restaurant a rating based on the service we received by Kanesha, it would have 5 stars!  Unfortunately, the food was mediocre.  I ordered the smoked turkey panini sans bacon, my mom and her husband ordered the margherita pizza and Caesar salad to split.  To be honest, I liked their pizza better than my sandwich.  I did not try their salad, however.  The best part of my sandwich was the panini - it was actually pretty delicious.    I've been a traveler all my life (since I was in diapers) so I've grown to learn that airport food is not always the best...especially considering they charge you an arm and a leg for the food.  Overall, the experience here wasn't bad.  The service was great, the food not so much."
Was told about this place when I worked in Tempe.  Everyone raved about it.  Went and felt like I was at a Fudruckers.   Was overall disappointed in my experience.  Burger was ok.  Maybe just an off day?
Order ahead or stop in be prepared to wait ... I go to a busy Starbucks downtown at lunchtime everyday and it is busier but they pump the drinks out faster. They need a separate line here for food and fraps. I never wait less that 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes for an iced tea. Nothing special with my drink. I hate this Starbucks. Expect to wait. They need hire more people.
"So here's the deal. Game 7 of the World Series in a Chicago bar and this place only has 1 bartender. She is doing the best she can, but really???!!! Food is good, but took forever.   Come on.  Get it together!"
"I went to Beso for my friend's bachelorette party with a group of ladies and we were told that dinner was complimentary and all we had to do is to leave tips for the server, which was $10/person.  I thought it was really nice of them to comp our dinner, especially with 9 ladies all together.  It all began with champagne.  When the first server (very nice) started to serve champagne to us, she had run out of it after 3 glasses.  She then opened another bottle and continued pouring.  Another female server rushed over and asked: why did you open another bottle for them and then whispered something to the first server.  5 minutes later, another server came to us and told us that our dinner included appetizer, tossed salad, steak, and a bed of mashed potatoes, which sounded amazing, right? Not even close.  We got  2 tiny servings of guacamole with a very light portion of tortilla chips, and I think the chef forgot to season it with, you know, salt, onion, and whatever recipe it calls for.  0 star.  The steak was a joke.  It had no flavor, overcooked, and lukewarm.  There were literally 8 pre-cut pieces of steak for 9 people, with a bed of mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes was the best part of the meal, but then again, all of us shared a one person meal.    I would have been fine to pay the $10 tips if the service was good, but we had to call 4 different servers to get some iced water, after we had already waited 10 minutes.  So we paid $90 for this crappy meal.  Was it worth it?  I'd rather give a homeless guy my $10 then spending it at Beso."
Probably the worst managed club of all times. Came out for opening weekend and the staff was more concerned on making sure girls couldn't sit then stepping in when a fight broke out. Also came to see deadmau5 preform and he didn't actually dj until 1:45 and we couldn't get a straight answer from any of the staff when he was going to start so we went to leave the club to sit down but were informed that there was no re-entry to the club. Don't waste your time or money on this club there are much better options out there.
"Joseph and Lynn were amazing. They were quick, efficient, careful AND had the best price. What can get better than that? I won't use anyone else."
"Dignity Moving was great. As soon as they got to my house they told me to put my feet up and relax, they had it. Daniel and Lyn were super nice and really professional. They did not stop moving once they started. Moving was seamless and I loved the overall experience. I would strongly recommend these guys.   Also, the prices are the best you will find. Awesome work for not much $$"
"My husband and I were in Vegas for an entire week to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary! My very generous in-laws booked The Jockey Club for our trip and we were curious to see what it was like, being advertised as ""snuggled between City Center and Bellagio"". Cozy and quaint, The Jockey Club certainly is.    We had two friends staying with us for half the trip and our one bedroom plus sofa bed gave us plenty of room. The front desk people were friendly and helpful, but avoid the puppet conning you across the hotel desk with ""free tickets"", night club passes and free buffets in exchange for 90 minutes of hard-pressure time share sales meetings. Not on my vacation time, buddy.   The elevators were padded, clearly indicating construction in process. No big worry. Our room was spacious, clean and welcoming. The decor, umm...like Town and Country magazine's ""Equestrian Love"" edition, circa 1987. Yeah. The kitchen was modern-ish, but the stove is electric and takes 'till kingdom come to heat anything.   The sheets and pillows were fresh and comfy. The walk-in closet was a plus. The bathroom was fine except for the hard water that stripped my hair and skin of any moisture my body could provide. My skin actually broke out from the water and a bottle of L'Occitaine Conditioner was my life saver.   Overall, the Jockey Club is a great place to stay if you have kids in tow, have a group of people or are just looking for a place to crash at night on the strip.  Be aware if you come with the intention of making any meals in the condo: The grocery store downstairs can be passed. Thay have Wal-Mart store brand pasta and sauce on the shelf. That bad.  The closest possible thing to ""DIY"" foodstuffs is Walgreens, where you can dish out $4 for a dozen eggs. Better off eating out hella lot or getting a cab to Smith's or Whole Foods."
"Well, I'm glad I was hungry when I got here. Nothing was bad, per se, but not a lot was great. My comparisons in terms of big-time buffets are the ones at the Grand Hyatt and Coex Intercontinental in Seoul. To start off with, even though we didn't really have a problem ourselves, the service seemed a bit spotty, with neighboring buffet-goers having great difficulty locating/flagging down anyone to take drink orders or bring back drinks that had been ordered some time ago. It seemed that there weren't enough servers, which is either an oversight or just plain not caring on the part of the management (I spied a self-important type in a suit walking around with an earpiece, seemingly oblivious to customer complaints). There was enough variety...seafood, Asian, Italian, American, etc. I actually thought the American dishes fared the best, such as the baby beets and prime rib. And maybe it's my sweet tooth, but dessert wasn't too bad, either. I enjoyed the shot glass-like portions of tiramusi and other desserts whose names I can't remember now.  I'll check out another place next time I'm in town."
"My wife and I celebrated our eleventh anniversary last night by going to Beso Steakhouse at the City Center. We hadn't been there before and wanted to try something different. Of course, being the signature restaurant for the hot and beautiful Eva Longoria, we had high hopes.  The reservation process was simple. We made the reservation online in about 1 minute and indicated on the reservation form that it was our anniversary.  While our high hopes weren't dashed, they were somewhat dampened. First, the restaurant is beautiful inside, tasteful, dark and understated decor. The servers prompt and attentive (almost too attentive at times) but we never had to look around wonder where they were. I'd give them good marks for service although when we arrived we were the earlier diners. The place did fill up quickly after we arrived, although I'm sure it had nothing to do with our being there.  We were given menus along with a drink menu and recommendations. We were also promptly brought small but delicious glasses of champagne with congratulations for our anniversary. Kudos for that touch.  We ordered drinks and the waiter said he would wait and bring those with our food since we were enjoying the champagne.  We took our time ordering, starting with a crab Louie salad which we shared. It was well prepared, delicious and adequate for the two of us to share. The greens were fresh and crisp and the asparagus spears steamed but still crisp.  Since we were in no rush, we ordered dinner after the salad was finished so that threw off their timing a little and it took awhile to get  there which was no problem for us. We ordered the 20 oz. filet mignon with butter steamed lobster and a side dish of macaroni and cheese.   Moments before the food arrived, our waiter brought the drinks we had ordered...for Kath a pineapple surprise. I think the surprise was that it was pink and didn't taste like pineapple but it was tasty and not too sweet. I had a margarita rocks with Herradura silver tequila that was wonderful.   The entree was well prepared and as ordered. The mac and cheese hot and tasty, not too creamy like some.  We were stuffed by the end of the entree but couldn't resist two cappuccino and what we expected was a small dessert. Surprisingly, the capps were served in over-sized cups with loads of foam rather than those dainty cups that I can never get my sausage fingers through. We ordered the pineapple upside down cake (any theme here) and it came out baked to order in a small iron cauldron which the waiter upended on a plate leaving a cake the size of a small derby. Two bites and we were done.  OK, great service, terrific food and not the usual 'pea-sized' portions of higher end restaurants. So why the three stars. OK, here's my thoughts on that. Dinner was about $200 with the tip...not unexpected, even though we split the salad, entree and dessert.   So for a good meal for two, you could expect to get closer to $350 or so, if you didn't split. For that price level, one would expect something truly special, something outstanding but it just was your average really good steakhouse and Vegas abounds with those sorts of places for less. Think Del Frisco's on Paradise.  So without a doubt, it was a wonderful and magical evening but more because I was sharing it with my wonderful wife of eleven years than any other reason."
If I was a tourist I could get into this but it's just not worth the trouble. The service usually leaves something to be desired and the food - while yummy - takes longer than necessary. It may be because they were busy every time I was there (3x) but my feeling is that they should accommodate the volume with more staff. If you go try the fish tacos. I hear they have good tropical/island themed drinks as well. It's also awkwardly attached to a Tommy Bahama store front. If you're in need of a Hawaiian shirt or khakis  after lunch you're in luck.
"We arrived to the Jockey Club after a 7 hour layover, very relieved to finally be in Vegas. We were told to check in at three different locations in the hotel by three different staff members before finally arriving to the security office who apparently handles the check ins. We finally got up to our ""penthouse"" and were very excited to kick off my 21st birthday weekend. When we arrived in the room the bed had clearly been slept in, there was trash strewn around the room, dirty towels laying around the bathroom, and dirty underwear in the garbage. When we called the front desk, they said housekeeping is not offered, but to call the number in the room and someone would come clean the room for us. Called that number only to be told the girl no longer cleans the penthouses. Called the owner who told us the room was not dirty, that his housekeeper had ""just"" cleaned the room, and then accused us of lying to get a refund. We were then told that a housekeeper would come to clean in ""a couple of hours,"" but that he wouldn't refund our money because he was ""already losing money on this room because of us."" At this point it was already almost 10 pm and we had decided to check into a real hotel. Not 10 minutes after we had left the hotel we were called and told the housekeeper ""cleaned"" the room and it was ready for us. We weren't taking any chances. Save your money and check into somewhere that doesn't treat their clientele like garbage. If zero stars would be an option, that's what I'd give them."
"So the food is ""the vig food""... very good!  The problem with this location (hopefully) is that it just opened.  The service was not very good.  What this place needs is a couple months to work out the kinks... then it will probably be as good as the others.  Now I see why the ratings are lower at this place."
"I needed a mover to do a swap of our business storerooms.  This had been done before with another company ~ but my executives thought the final price was rather high considering the simplicity of the move.  So, I did the Thumbtack thing and expressed the need to stay within our budget.  Daniel responded and after a detailed rundown on what exactly would be moved and the destination he gave me a quote, which was significantly lower than the other movers.  SUPER fast and professional and we will be using them for all our moving needs."
"We had another very enjoyable meal at Tommy Bahama's. There's such a wide selection on the menu (as well on the cocktail & wine menu) that there should be something for every palate. Not that I can seem to deviate from the Scallop Sliders. I always get them! This time, though, they were over-seasoned. The Black Sea Bass entree was excellent.  The ""Orange Curtain"" is a sweet n sour rum treat ~ a nice way to begin.   I want to make a special note that the hostess was exceptional. She truly embodied a ""welcoming"" attitude and gladly gave us a different table than the one originally selected. It set the tone for the whole meal. Our table service was friendly as well, but on the slow side.   The dessert servings are huge ~ note that you can get a ""half slice!"" Pina colada cake, I'm coming for you. Next time!  Geez! I almost forgot to add one tidbit important to some: it was VERY low-lit on the night we were there.  I don't mind it, but it was a struggle to read the menu. Check out the menu on line to help yourself out if this bugs you. I did have a nice photo opp with a backlit water out of it!"
"One word - ""quick"". This is a great place if you only have half an hour but you want something cheap, sit down, and it's not a sandwich.   I have to say, this is not the best place to hang out with friends, it's more like order, eat and leave asap when you are done. It is not too clean although I haven't had any problem yet. I'm sure the food is fresh given their insane amount of turnover everyday.  my favourites: 1. Their rice dish with pork chop, sunny side-up friend egg 2. Their rice noodle (bun) with pork chop  3. also, their smoothies are good too"
"Can we say Overpriced?? The Manager was beyond nice and comforting. Which wasn't a problem if  only the waitresses had the same attitude and  attentiveness as their manager things would have been a little more pleasant in my opinion.  I hate it when they only time they want to ask if someone wants a refill is my boyfriends alcoholic bevareges. It's like geeze people my amazing lemonade has been gone for over 30 minutes and you do not want to ask me if I would like more?! YES I WOULD HAVE. The food was severely minimal for the price. I had ordered the Thai shrimp and scallops with the coconut curry. Not bad. But not good enough for 26 dollars. I wish i had gotten their tiny filet instead.  Just disappointed just like I am sure the rest of our large party was.  It seems like they barely asked anyone at our table besides my boyfriend if they wanted more beverages. Which I really quite sad if you ask me. Because with as little food they give you, you would think people might like a refill on whatever it is that they ordered drink regardless if it had alcohol in it. I mean seriously its my hard to ask that question. Actually it's more polite and expected of a waitress especially with as big of a table bringing in the profit off of gratuity. Probably the reason they felt they didn't have to do much since they are getting tipped anyways so I'm sure they felt they didn't have to work for it. Sad. If I'm ever around the  area I know where not to come for food. An that would be this place."
"Just a casual afternoon out with my family, we decided to come to this place for some tasty Vietnamese food! I ordered a small pho and it was decent but wasn't the best pho I've ever had. They put to much noddles and it was to salty. The avocado milkshake is a must have, since they use fresh avocados! However,the service her was not amazing nor bad. There were only two people out in front to take care of the whole front! Twice I requested some spoons and both times they forgot to bring it to me. The service is really slow here so if you quick service this is not the place for you."
"ZERO STARS!! What a waste of time!!!! Thanks for making us pay for a babysitter since no children are allowed In a family tour. Complete lack of communication with their sales reps. Told us any bill with the same address on it would suffice for proof of residence. Denied my fiancé and I the tour and the vacation we were promised after letting us sit and wait on them for 30 minutes. Engaged, living together and share three children together. Still not enough to be qualified as ""co-habitants"". Then what is?!? They want health insurance with both names on it. Tell me what insurance through your job will cover your fiancé (not wife) as well? Glad that sales rep got her commission. She owes us $$$ for the babysitter."
I go to their location on Higley and Chandler Heights. They are so friendly and they do their job perfectly. My entire family gets their clothes dry cleaned here and we absolutely love it! They have our stuff ready as soon as we walk in through the door and always have next day pick up available which is so convenient!!!
"I've been coming here for years and they are the only place I would ever trust with my expensive clothes. I also always know that when I go there, I'm going to get my clothes back fast and that I am going to receive friendly service from the family that owns it. What more can you ask for?"
"Larry LoLo White has gotten a little too big for his britches! While it's wonderful that he has brought some glam to SoPho, let's get real... It's soul food! Valet parking imposed, no call-in to go orders, pricey food. They do have some of the best fried chicken, greens and banana pudding around though. Careful Larry, cons are beginning to outweigh the pros! Maybe a little soul searching?!"
Jessica didn't know what she was doing. My hair looks awful and I have a ton of bleeding of my colors. I went to another stylist to see and now I need corrective color.   Worst of all was she kept texting and face booking during my appointment. I felt very much like she was annoyed and I bothered her to be there.
"Holy crap, this buffet is great.  The food is so fresh, and there are so many choices.  I really stuffed myself silly here.  I just wanted to try a little bit of everything.  Their seafood were incredibly fresh and not too salty as some places like to make their crab legs.  My parents and I ate platefuls of full.  And then even had room for dessert.  The presentation of the entire place was gorgeous.  And the desserts looked so good, I just wanted to try them all.  This is one of the best buffets in Las Vegas, hands down."
"I love Vig, especially their nachos and half priced bottles of wine on Sundays. However, I sincerely dislike their indoor seating because this is where all the servers gather to chat, gab, and roll silverware. Management seriously needs to take control of the situation here because it makes me not want to go to Vig when I'd like to sit inside."
Do not go here. This buffet has gone down hill with quality since they first opened. Cooked Fish options were ice cold and our fried chicken was raw in the middle.. Management did not want to acknowledged our complaints and were just blatantly rude. Stay away you'll find better food elsewhere
"4.5 stars but I'll round up! :)  This is my second favorite buffet in Vegas (after Wicked Spoon). Again, the quality of the food you get here is totally worth the price! I especially love the sweet pea risotto and the crepe station :) YUM.  One trick is to come here during lunch and stay until dinner! That way, you get to try both lunch and dinner menu, but only paying the lunch price! However, you'll probably be wasting a lot of your time in Vegas here, but hey, it's worth it!"
"Fourth time here and must say very disappointed!! The service was horrible! Sergio was seen then not seen for ever and you could tell everyone was looking around and food was coming out late from the  kitchen !  We really like this place and the atmosphere is always great but this time could be our last ! Our food took longer than usual and even getting a refill on WATER was a chore!! Just a piece of advice is to not to try and reach over people while they are eating to remove plates . I am definitely one that likes my area to be clean but manners are also just as important!!  At the end when we were done eating we were asked if we wanted dessert and my son said he would like the churros and minutes/seconds later the bill and no dessert dropped of before I could get a word in ! At this point I was like forget it but then 7 minutes or so later Sergio grabs the check and says sorry ""wrong bill"" and then gives us the churros and a new bill ! It was not the wrong bill he just forgot about the dessert and was overwhelmed!!     We will see if we go back !!"
"This is my second time to see Danielle at Blush Salon. I should have given her a 5 star rating the first time so consider this a 10 star rating!  My Brazillian Blowout is awesome...still smooth and straight even in the 100% humidity of Kauai.  Danielle also does the best highlights I have ever had...when I ask for blonde, I get blonde!  I also need to mention my hair extensions..love them....Again...Danielle is the best!  If you are looking for color, extensions, or a blowout, I highly recommend Danielle at Blush Salon.  BTW...super nice salon...great décor and love the hair washing chairs...so comfy you could doze off before the conditioner goes on!"
I have been going to Blush since they have opened.  Love it there.  Melissa does my hair.  I am constantly getting compliments.  Loves it so much my Nana and Tia go here now.   My other Tia travels from out of state just to get a haircut here.  Love this place
"Lost count of how many times I've been here but whenever the craving strikes for Viet food, Golden Turtle answers the bell."
Me and my family have been coming here for 3 years and love love love this place. Always good food and the service is always fantastic. Every now and then we come on a Sunday and they mess up our order but I can let that go because that does happen from time to time but we know when certain people are there it does not happen.  We typically eat in and probably twice per month order delivery. Food is great every time! My only complaint is they need a larger dining area because they can get very busy :)
"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Me and my girlfriend went in there with our three children because the decor looked appealing. When we went in there the lady asked us if we wanted to decorate some cookies. We asked if we were just paying for the cookie and she said yes implying that it would be a nice low cost activity for us and the kids. We thought it was a great idea. We told her we were going to stop at the toy store next door and come back and decorate the cookies. When we came back the cookies were ready for us and she had mentioned that she was going to be giving us complimentary drinks to make our experience better. After about fifteen minutes of awkward and uncomfortable comments being made from the worker, we decided to be done. My oldest son even mentioned that the lady reminded him of an witch trying to lure people in to her building just like any wicked witch straight out of a fairy tale. Let me add that my girlfriend ordered dip n dots just to add another item to our total bill since she thought we were getting such a good deal. Well as my girlfriend went to pay the total came out to about 50.00 dollars which was completely unexpected as the worker continued to act as if they were doing this activity as an added benefit for the kids to have fun. My girlfriend turned to me about the high price but I had already left the store. We found this experience very offensive as we were told the only cost was going to be the price of the cookie and we were given the impression that it was a fun cheap thing for the kids. Never go to this place unless you want to be ripped off ton pay 50 bucks for two cookies."
"We go to this establishment at least once a week, the family gets different items, me, I ALWAYS get a calzone.  The service is always friendly, the prices are good, and the food is GREAT!  We have pretty much decided this is our place of choice for the weekly Italian get away."
"My overall review for the place is mixed. Many of what people say in previous reviews are the same things we deal with on a daily basis. The mowing/leafblowing before sunrise every thursday lol. The office lady's are pretty mean and I always feel like I'm bothering them. The gate's are so messed up here, and never on a set schedule. Overall not a bad place, didn't hate it didn't love it. Seems to be better then places back behind us lol."
"We come to Vegas every couple of years. In the past the Wynn Buffet was our absolute favorite...even eating here twice in one visit. We LOVE the hotel and almost always stay here so after a 5 year absence we couldn't wait to go back to the buffet. We went on a Tuesday at 5pm and there was no wait. I usually like to look over the options before diving in. The food looked ok...not like what we remembered. I started with a piece of blackened Salmon (super dry no flavor) beef slider (bun was dry, no sauce, meat was so dry you couldn't swallow it), pot sticker (ok) steamed meat bun (bland) spicy tuna hand roll (soggy and not spicy) and a piece of Italian sausage (ok). Boy, this was not what we remembered...no lamb, the crab legs looked like they were left overs off of a real crab, shrimp looked awful. Street taco station was again just ok. Nothing seemed to have any flavor and most everything was way overcooked. My husband had the prime rib and said that was good..why they get 2 stars not one. The muscles tasted like rubber. They added a Raman station...again completely without flavor. The rest of the selections just plain looked unappetizing and low end. This buffet is $40 per person. It at best is worth about $15-20...the high end if the food actually was cooked properly and had flavor. Will not go back."
"This review is for Andrea Abshere  You want a makeup artist who can take your description of what you're looking for in makeup and re-create it on your face, right? You want a makeup artist who is cool and fun and friendly while she does your makeup, right? Well, Andrea is both. I first met Andrea when I was in my friend's wedding two and a half years ago. When it was time for my own wedding, I knew that I wanted to use her. I spent some time picking out pictures of makeup that I liked and then I met with Andrea for a trial. She took those pictures and my skin tone and did my makeup so that it looks flawless and natural all at the same time! She really did make me look my best self. Andrea also does eyelash extensions so on the week of the wedding, I got eyelash extensions which were a lot of fun because that meant I didn't have to wear mascara or really much makeup on my honeymoon (they last two weeks!) I recommend Andrea because shes incredibly talented, she listens to the client, is incredibly kind and super fun to chat with!"
"Tons of buildings to explore jam packed with furniture. I agree with the other reviewers that prices can be high but that said, I have also got a good deal on some things there over the years. I bought an antique secretary desk for only $129 and my husband bought me a grandfather clock there for our anniversary one year. (He didn't tell me what he paid but he's not one to throw money away) They also have a building with new furniture and mattresses. We bought a new mattress there just a few months ago and got a steal because we could buy the floor model (it was wrapped in plastic so don't get too grossed out!) It is the best bed and we would have paid double for it elsewhere. I also love their ""junk"" room. I'm a teacher and can find fun things for my classroom here."
"Good option for airport food.  Freshly made and has veggie options.  Also the ability to get brown rice.  Overall, filling and potentially healthy if you order wisely!   One of my favorite quick options when flying through Charlotte."
Wide variety of dishes. Very friendly service. Love Vietnamese food. Best place in the area.  Pretty much the only place in the area that you can eat something healthy.
"Pretty much what you would expect from a Vegas buffet.  I would say that the dessert bar is the highlight, and sadly it wasn't the food.  The food wasn't bad, but Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon were just more creative and tasty with their dishes."
"The salon was nice and clean. I only went here after reading the great reviews. The person that usually cuts my hair at another salon was on maternity leave. I usually pay $16 for a great haircut and I paid $45 at this salon. The girl that cut my hair was friendly and really tried to get my cut right but after I left I noticed there were pieces that were uneven. I have an A-line Bob. I have a lot of hair and it's thick. In my experience, not many people know how to deal with it all."
"My two star review is based on the quality of the food, the service, and delivery time.   Food - I have only ordered their cheese pizzas. Being born and raised on the east coast, this is hands down the best pizza in Vegas. I can't speak on anything else off the menu. My two stars are for the pizza and the pizza alone.  The service - Horrible. No accountability and too many excuses when mistakes are made. It's just absolutely ridiculous.   Delivery time - DO NOT EVER have your pizza delivered from his location! You can always count on your pizza coming cold and AT LEAST a half hour late. There were a couple times that my husband and I accepted the pizza, sat down to eat and realized that it was freezing and would have to heat it up ourselves in the oven. Eventually after realizing that this location just was never going to get it right, we started picking the pizza up from the other location on horizon ridge.   So, today we decided to give this place a 5th or 6th chance. Can't remember how many times they've screwed up. BIG MISTAKE!! 25 minutes late and freezing cold. Good thing we learned our lesson and opened the box before handing the delivery guy the money and taking the pizza.  Do yourself a favor. Dine in or pick up from the horizon ridge store. Whoever manages this location needs to take some tips from the Horizon Ridge location because their phenomenal. I would love to meet the owner actually."
"Wow.  Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in my life.  Definitely the worst potuguese chicken I've ever had.   Where to start.  Chicken tasteless despite asking for spicy, no seasoning present whatsoever.  Potatoes weren't even cooked properly.  Salad no dressing.  No piri piri with chicken.  Hard skip guys.  I can't believe it was this bad."
"Quite simply, Daniel and his team are the best movers I've ever dealt with -- yes, ever! These guys are total pros: fabulous communication, on-time, friendly, lightning-fast and magicians at packing up a PODS nice and tight. I will definitely be using Dignity when I move into our new house!"
"This particular Arby's is just average....it has a nice staff....and the food is just average as well. Right now there is a promotion going on for there new chicken salad sandwich....and it is just average as well. If you like Roast beef.....and I don't....then this of course is the place for you. The deals they have on roast beef sandwiches are unmatched....but that is about all they can boast about. The curly fries are a must because the regular french fries are again just average. So  I guess I am saying if your looking for average food then come on over to this locale......if not move on but continue to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
"I've never been to this Barro's Pizza, but we order delivery from there all the time. I'm very happy with the delivery time frame and the quality of food when we order. Delicious!"
Chinese food good.I think they should just stick to Chinese food leave asian food alone. Do not Order Hibachi from this place didn't taste like it to me.
"I went here for dinner on a Sunday, $34.95 a person and well worth it! I am a lil' asian girl, but don't let the stature fool you, I ate my money's worth! They have unlimited Alaskan crab legs, and blue crab legs; They had veal; lamb chops; dim sum (which is actually REALLY well made).. Infact everything tasted delightful.  They don't have a salad bar; they have individually prepared specialty salads in small glass containers. They have a two-sided dessert area with everything from chocolate mousse, creme brulee, cream puffs, AND crepes they prepare to your liking. Cost of drinks is included, but you gotta tip the waitress at the end of it all."
"Worst massage experience EVER. Place is a mess, and disorganized. Doors from other rooms were open, for me to sneak a view of some extremely messy rooms!. Carpet hasn't been cleaned or vaccumed for years, i would say.. so if you have allergies, I would avoid this place, unless you want to take 4 Reactins prior to your appointment.  About the massage itself ( that is when I FINALLY got it, after the owner cancelled on me TWICE at the very last minute.. meaning.. within HOURS): It was good.. but reckon I had asked for a neck and shoulder massage.. and NOT a full body massage, with 5-10 minutes spent on my neck and shoulders  Disorganized, Frazzled. Why the hell am I paying so much for a bloody massage from a this place! Found the place raking rather high on the unprofessional side of things!.   I know it seems others have previously reviewed this place well.. however, i'd like to make you aware that NONE of these happy people described in the previous posts actually even WORK there anymore. It seems they have ALL gone elsewhere.. concidence? I think  not! Don't go. Titanic sunk pretty fast!"
"i paid $10 for a very small pulled pork bbq sandwich, small drink with a small side of mac and cheese and a small bread roll. Everything tasted like it came from a can, then stuck straight in the microwave..memphis bbq? that's an insult to memphis! not t mention my food was lukewarm at best. this place should be ashamed to serve such gross food for the money you pay!!!"
"I came with a party of 8 utilizing four travel zoo vouchers.   I must say-- after reading all the horror stories about the staff being rude and the food being less than par, I was a little worried. One of my girlfriends coordinated the dinner-- she told us she had been in constant contact with the restaurant, making reservations and providing the restaurant with our voucher information before hand.   Our reservation was for a Saturday Night at 6 p.m and we arrived at about 6:10. No problem-- we were welcomed kindly and seated promptly. Our server was Joseph. Surprise-- he was great! He explained to us all of the limitations to the Travel Zoo voucher upfront and in a respectful manner. He told us about all the food he enjoyed and answered our questions with ease. Here is what my boyfriend and I ate:  Bread Basket: Pretzel bread, chip, dinner rolls. The stand out bread here is the pretzel bread! All the bread was soft and warm.   Foie Gras to Share: Delicious! The toast, jelly and Foie Gras was such a delightful combination. The jelly really caught my taste buds off gaurd.  Tortilla Soup: When you ordre this, the soup is poured into your bowl at the table. It was very filling. The soup had just the right amount of spice and started to fill me up, so I didn't finish all of it so I could finish my dinner.  Crab Louie Salad: This is a simple salad with a hard boiled egg, crab meat and a tangy dressing. It was ok-- because it was a little more expensive we were given a smaller portion, which was fine by my boyfriend and I because we still had a porterhouse coming for an entree.   Porterhouse: My boyfriend and I ordered the porterhouse (for items above $55, there is an upcharge of $10-$20 for the larger steaks) which was delicious As expected, the bone was pretty heavy. I'd guess it was probably about 10-15 oz on its own. The meat was tender and cooked how we'd like it. But it was JUST meat-- no sides or anything. After the bread basket, Foie Gras and Tortilla Soup, this was all I probably could have ate anyway. Some of my friends got the petite filet-- if you ordered that, you got a side for free. I got to taste the Tuna Adobo-- that was surprisingly sweet and filling.   Dessert: Chocolate Kiss Brownie. It paired well with the ice cream, and the sauce was a treat. But mind you, it was just a brownie, nothing too flashy.   At the end, we were charged a 15% gratuity per pair and tax came out to around $6.75. We were also charged a $20.00 up charge for ordering the porterhouse.   Overall, I would do this again. Be concious of the fact that servers vary-- not everyone is snooty! Thanks Beso for a delicious and fun experience!"
"Very disappointed!  When we got there, it was warm and after we ordered, we were told that the air conditioning was not working.  Don't forget -- it was summertime in Vegas.  Okay -- we sat down under a ceiling fan, thinking we could weather the storm.  We didn't feel like pizza and my husband ordered chicken Parmesan and I order eggplant Parmesan.  We were served salads which were just ordinary.  Our main course arrived.  Personally, I don't care for it when eggplant or chicken is served on top of spaghetti, as opposed to it being next to one another.  This is how they both came out.  We were also given  what was a poor excuse for garlic bread.  In addition, the pasta was overcooked.  Once our dinners were brought to us, we never saw the server again, except from a distance!  I had to get up and get a straw myself.  Without the A/C it felt warmer and warmer.  About the same time we decided we couldn't stand the heat anymore, the cook walked out of the kitchen a few feet, poured himself a draft beer and stood there a minute  He took a few gulps and walked back into the kitchen area with his beer.  This was the straw that broke the camel's back.  It's no big surprise we will never go back.  Their prices reflected something decent but this place is just a joint.  Even their pizzas are expensive for what they are.    Oh, well.  To each his own!"
"2 hours linetime, low quality food, very limited number of dishes.  Dessert is awsome especially chees cake and creme brûlée."
"I agree with other Yelpers in the fact that I should have read reviews before buying anything. The shop is absolutely adorable and they do a good job of making their baked goods look good. However, the taste is just not there. I paid $8.95 for a slice of Oreo layer cake. The slice is huge, but for that price, I would have expected a moist and flavorful cake. It was dry and it doesn't have that cookies and cream taste. The frosting is just bland. I have paid less for better tasting cake. I'd recommend this place just to have a look, but don't buy the cake."
I've been going to Oxford Cleaners since 2006.  They make you feel like family when you arrive and treat you like they value your business.  I don't write Yelp reviews but have noticed a few negative reviews on here and feel that is a dirty way to try to gain business.  (other local dry cleaners) Oxford Cleaners are the best in south Chandler and if you want someone to treat you like family you need to use Oxford.
3/5! Good place to go with a large group of coworkers for lunch in the financial district! I recommend the bottom line Cobb salad. The sandwiches are large so can easily be shared.
"Went for brunch on a Sunday, ordered a Mimosa and Crab Cakes. Both were very good. The service was excellent, the waiter was very attentive. I would definitely recommend for a nice Sunday afternoon brunch place. They were fairly busy when I went as well, but still received excellent & quick service and delicious food."
"We celebrated a friend's birthday with dinner at Beso.  We wanted to dine at Lavo but was unable to get reservations so we decided on Beso because we knew that Eva Longoria owned it.  The food was great, the service was great but there was something missing.  I wasn't overly impressed with the location.  It's in the corner of the Crystals Shopping mall.  I thought it was an odd location choice for a restaurant/nightclub.  There are great floor to ceiling windows but the view is nothing to brag about.  Who wants to stare at a street/valet drop off while you eat a very expensive dinner.    The decor was ok but once again nothing to spectacular.    With so many interesting restaurant choices in Las Vegas I doubt I will try Beso again.  It didn't ""Wow"" me enough to return."
For such a highly rated spot I expected much more.. Service was average. I asked the waiter a few questions about some menu items and he didn't elaborate too much. My bone-in rib eye was just ok too. I ordered it medium but probably should have gone medium rare.  My mistake.  Sides were just  average too. For the price my tastebuds wishing I went to a different spot.
"Ordered 3 meals received 2 , delivery driver states I don't know what to tell you. Called into store was told I would be charged a second delivery fee for them to correct the mistake they made..... The food is good but the staff is incredibly rude I was eating here once a week for the past 2 years and will never return"
"I used to love the Wynn buffet, but over the years it went downhill so I stopped going. But last week, we decided to give it another try since we haven't gone in over two years and I really enjoyed it! We had a large party of 16 and luckily we went early so we didn't have to wait in a long line. They sat us in a side room with no other customers which was really nice.  We went on a Sunday night. The dinner buffet has an assortment of salads, bread and prosciutto, various pizzas, fish, a carving station, made to order street tacos, a ramen bar, dim sum, sushi, crab and assorted seafood. With so many choices, I could not try everything! I did really enjoy their prime rib. I was pleasantly surprised that the meat was so flavorful and tender. All my coworkers also really enjoyed everything they ate.   Like most buffets in Vegas, there is a huge dessert selection. Gelato, cupcakes, candied apples, a crepe station etc. Be sure to save room! A few of our coworkers got the bottomless drinks and enjoyed beer and sangria! I decided to stick with just enjoying the food. I'm so glad that the buffet at the Wynn is good again! It's pretty pricey, but worth it for the quality and assortment."
"My husband and I went for lunch and ordered the large pizza and half bucket of wings special. Diet dr pepper needed changed and they did it promptly and let me know when it was ready. Wings were great. A little more meat than some but sauce was perfect for size. Pizza was excellent. Toppings plentiful. We both were definitely full when we left, and still had enough leftovers for our family of 5 to have for dinner. Think we have found our pizza place!"
My boyfriend and I eat Thai quite often. This place was great ! Best Pad Thai we've both had in a long time. My bf enjoyed the rare beef ball pho however said the noodles could have been better. Spring rolls are delicious. Would definitely go back ! And the people who worked there were so kind and smiley :)
Worst Apartment I would say. Pathetic Management Infested and filthy apartments
"Came here for lunch today. Honestly, I wasn't that impressed. Its about $25 for lunch & we waited about 30 minutes. Our waitress was completely rude. She looked so bothered when we would ask her for refills. Our plates were barely getting taken away - the food selection is okay. I mean, they have a little bit of everything from everywhere but the TYPE of food was just okay. I mean yeah i'm sure dinner is better BUT its still LUNCH. LOL.  Probably won't come back - I'd like to try another place. Any recommendations on buffets?"
"Worst hair cut I've ever received, asked for a small trim on hair I've grown out for 6 months and they cut it down to a finger length. Didn't listen and didn't make a smooth fade.  Wouldn't recommend for anyone who needs a trim or any one who has longer then finger length hair or you'll be greatly disappointed in every way shape and form."
"Lovely laid back, but nice atmosphere. Surprisingly cheap lunch & happy hour.   When I'm not wanting meat or pasta this is one of my favorite places. Their grilled vegetables main course dish is spectacular.   The grilled artichoke has been a hit or miss before, but as long as your sipping their sangria you won't mind."
Contracted food poisoning Sunday night. Waiter said there were problems in the kitchen. Half of the kitchen was broken whatever that means. I ordered beef taquitos in the bar. Took 45 minutes to get. I would be careful here. I won't be going back.
"For airport breakfast when sleep was quite minimal, this wasn't too bad. Greasy food was available!  They actually make real eggs to order rather than some artificial scrambled eggs from a box. The bacon was almost crispy and the hashbrown was straight from the freezer to the fryer.   Still, needing some brekkie before a long day of foodless flying, it filled me up without negative consequences.  Who is this Burke guy anyway and why won't they let him out of the box already?"
"A staple restaurant for me! It hurts a little to add a staple restaurant to my list that's a chain, but I am NEVER disappointed. I usually start with a key lime martini or a glass of the Cohn Silver cab followed by coconut shrimp over a bungalow salad paired with soft plantains. Service is consistent and they have a great patio."
"I stopped by this restaurant while waiting for my flight back to NYC from Las Vegas.  I tried this restaurant because I am familiar with the David Burke restaurants in NYC and always enjoyed the food. I didn't go for the sit down service but instead I chose to get take out.  The service was prompt and courteous at the take out counter. I tried the pretzel Panini meal which I thought was pretty good but too much for me to eat in one sitting. The pretzel bun was warm and soft. The grilled chicken, bacon and provolone combination was delicious and filling but I didn't think my meal could compare with any meal that I've had at one of his restaurant in the past. The food was just OK but definitely didn't live up to what I have experience in the past from a David Burke restaurant. The only thing that remained consistent was the high price of my meal which David Burke restaurants are definitely known for."
Worst club ever... The personnel  and stuff beginning from the coat check till security people were rude and had no idea how to treat with guests!!!
"More like ""not-worthy"" piano moving. Owner is grumpy, bad service. Failed to deliver piano on scheduled date."
"I don't normally feel the need to write a review, but we stopped in to grab some ""memphis rub bbq"" the other day while passing through. Sounded good, slow-roasted memphis rub bbq, right??.  NOT.  This was without a doubt nothing more than boiled meat with regular bbq sauce on top. Bland, watery, stringy boiled meat. The entire family felt the same way. I think what bothers me the most is the very obvious lack of care and effort in making ""bbq"" and then charging $9 for a ""platter"" that consists of scant portions of ordinary potato salad (walmart or costco came to mind) and a few tablespoons of baked beans (which were the best part of the meal). I don't like being ripped off, and definitely felt this place is out to rip off people. NO effort whatsoever to try and make realy bbq.This is NOT slow roased ""memphis rub bbq"". It is boiled meat in water. Horrible."
"I went here based on the good reviews and I was so dissapointed! Being an ex Nyer I was dying to find a good deli .This is not it. Now, it is pretty inside with cool, faux, brick walls and an archway that reminds me of a cheesy Italian place back east so my heart went pitter patter when I saw it. I did not have an artisan sandwich nor did I see one on the menu. This place is under new ownership  so perhaps they changed the menu.I kept hearing about how big the sandwiches were but mine was not( 6inch hero roll more or less) . I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it  was not good at all. I ordered a side of potato salad and it tasted like a cheap grocery store brand. No way could it have been homemade. Oh well the search continues. ( Just wish Cassellas was closer to me) Perhaps I didn't order one of their speciality items. Help me out here and recommend a good sandwich here and I will go back and try it. No tuna please, yuk! This is the second time I have eaten here and both times the meal was not good."
"I stopped by the Pig-n-Whistle to grab a drink while waiting for my wife to finish up with her retail therapy. Her shopping pushed us into the lunch zone so I returned to order the Pig Plate for about $8. You get some pig with some BBQ sauce  plus two sides. The mashed potatoes were a little to runny or watery for my taste and really didn't taste too good. The beans were ok, I would rate them as average. The pork was good, but next time I'll tell them not to put the BBQ sauce on the meat. I really enjoyed the free refills on the soda."
I live in Los Angeles and frequently visit the local bars and clubs. I'm always greeted with hospitality and kindness by security. This was not the case for me last night at Hakkasan. The people were treated like cattle. I've never been more uncomfortable in a club. I left early and spent the rest of my time in the lobby being bombarded by drunk men. Horrible experience. Would not recommend the venue to anyone. First night in Vegas.. fail.
"NO, just NO....  a few words come to mind when i think hakkasan. 1)HakkaDONT 2)HakkaWack 3)HakkaStairs 4)HakkaPretentious 5)HakkaLines 6)HakkaWTF  TRUST ME, i'm an elite.  Don't come here.  that is all."
Extremely prompt with order times and food is great as always. Large portions on everything!
After a 1 star review on 12/8.I was contacted by the west coast regional manager who apologizes for our previous experience and asked us to try their Restaurant again.We returned on 12/12.The dinner was a 100% turnaround.We were waited on promptly and Bruce took great care of us and was very professional.The food was excellent( try the scallop sliders) and we very much enjoyed it.The managers Zane and Dana even stopped to make sure we were being taken care of.All of the other diners appeared to be enjoying the meals as well.This is a resturant that showed concern with a poor experience and was able to turn things around on our next trip  Thank you.
"Ok, so admittedly this night was a ""once in a lifetime"" thing for us.  We were eating at the restaurant and started chatting with the table next  to us. We all hit it off and they invited us to their table at the nightclub. It was right next to the DJ booth on the main floor, and we danced and drank all night! The staff was awesome, and the music was great. We will be back again, but probably not at a table. Unless we can find people to split with. Awesome night, great club!"
"I can think of better ways to spend $35 (lunch price + tax and tip) in Vegas (you can actually eat well for an entire day for that amount if you're willing to venture off the strip), but if having a buffet in a major hotel is part of the Vegas experience, this isn't a bad place to check it off your list.  Not everything is good,and actually, nothing I had was exceptional, but there was enough I did enjoy (such as the carving station meats, a couple of fish dishes, all the options at the Chinese station, one soup, a stew, a couple of breads, the ice cream, and a couple other desserts) that I felt I got my money's worth (and didn't actually eat again for another 24 hours)."
This is a gas station off of Wildhorse Pass and the interstate 10 in south Phoenix. It has an Arby's in it and it is a truck stop. It's pretty clean and has a wide selection of pumps to use as well as good merchandise selection inside. The Arby's is open 24 hours which helps if you work all night like I do and feel like subjecting yourself to eating Arby's.
"I'm a fan of The Vig, and per a friend's request I met her here to check out the new digs.  I think because they are new, they are working out the kinks but there is lots of promise.  So it's hard to notice this spot because as of yet, there is no signage. It's in a house.  I drove the street twice til I realized the house WAS The Vig. The indoors is the restaurant portion and the side of the house is the patio area.  There are grassy areas, which is a nice touch and they have a central bar with seating all around, tables and chairs throughout the courtyard, and a fireplace with Adirondack chairs/tables as well.  The tall fence blocks out the traffic and construction going on nearby.  The menu is slightly different than 'my' Vig, but is primarily very similar. The bar waitstaff was initially a little slow, although it did pick up and they were all very cordial and helpful.    I'll come back next time I'm downtown as I think if y ou're a downtown dweller this could turn out to be as great as the other Vigs."
As you see i dont go to anything but the best places life is too short to deal with subpar places.   That why I go to zeroes barbershop. Attention to detail is their philosophy you walk out feeling like a million dollars.   No matter who you see here you will always get the star treatment.
"This place kicks a$$ for lunch. 2 slices and a drink for $4 (approx). The slices have always been good and hot, and i have never had an old cold slice! Plenty of indoor seating.."
"Daniel and his team did an outstanding job moving my mother from Peoria to Sun City, AZ. The entire move was orchestrated from Florida and Daniel responded to  every email, text and phone call in a timely and professional manner. Daniel and his team arrived at the appointed time and even called to let me know he was on his way. My mother was extremely pleased with every aspect of the move. Everything was handled with loving care; nothing was broken or damaged. The cost of the move was very reasonable. Highly recommend Dignity Moving Company.."
"Heard the mac and cheese was out of this world, so I was super excited to finally check it out. While it was good, it wasn't better than a lot of other places. We shared the jalapeño artichoke dip, it was definitely edible, but again nothing I would go back for. I wasn't that much of a fan of the environment. The drinking was definitely not being monitored by bar and serving staff the way it should have been, saw a guy literally fall out on the ground from being drunk. Glad I had the experience so that I wouldn't wonder, but it's not really somewhere I'd go out of my way to go back to."
Shamika is my girl! She does FABULOUS blonde highlights. I recently moved and tried out a few people; when I found her I was like YESSS I'm done looking! Great color and great cut every time.
"Never would have visited this delightful local pizza spot if it weren't for meeting up to watch the MNF game with 49er fans and Yelp friend Judd L and his sweet wife Lynn.  If you're a longtime local you'll remember this place as the former home of Villa Pizza ..but it's different owners and family run business now.  I appreciate the varied menu items they have to offer and the prices are great deals.  The staff is friendly didn't have too long of a wait for ordering or waiting for our food. The place is clean and the tables were always bused right away.  For some reason it's emphasized that there is no table service. I found ordering at the counter a lot more efficient anyways for this type of joint.  The dining area is open and airy. Plenty of seating both booths and tables for larger parties and/or sport teams. The interior deco has a homey feel with cool Americana knicknacs on the shelves and photos hanging on the walls.    Tried their basic salad which was a pretty generous serving and perfect for a family of 4. Fresh,crisp and cold, that's good in my book. Spaghetti and Italian sausage was good too.  When dining w/hubby we got the Pizza/Wing deal which is perfect since I hardly have pizza when dining out.  I chose to have the wings and hubby had the pizza.  I took a bite from Mr. B's pizza, it's NY style, thin crisp crust, love the sauce! Tasted homemade, like they simmered the ingredients for a while.   My chicken wings obviously just came outta the fryer cause they were so hot. Wings were good, but not like my favorite garlic parm ones at another place. The homemade canoli here though was a really nice sweet treat!      Another big plus in my book was how family friendly this place is. The times I have been here the place was quite busy with families and sports teams coming and going, you get a sense the local neighborhood gathers here to watch sports on the TV too! So now be ready, it's going to be invaded with 49er fans! Woot!"
Went after a blue jay game.  Sat at the bar.  Girls were doing a shot of Jack Daniels twice.  You can tell that they were drunk. Not the best of service.  Food was great had the wings and fish tacos.
"i've eaten here for years, everything vietnamese on their menu is bang on  portions are good, service is good this place has character people of all color and all walks of life come here  5/5 stars"
