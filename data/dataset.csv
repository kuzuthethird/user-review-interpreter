"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. The location of this hotel and very decent price makes this an amazing deal. When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.  The hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.  I would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.",1,1
Location is everything and this hotel has it! The reception is inviting and open 24 hours. They are very helpful and have a lot of patience answering all my questions about where to go etc. there is also a lounge open 24 hours with snack-type food. Breakfast is continental-style so if you want heartier fare look elsewhere though you don't have to go far. The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs. The windows are double paned so the room is quiet plus i was on the 5th floor which helps. It's a bit pricey but still one of the best values i found!,1,1
"Beautiful space, great location, staff rock. Tiny room, but this was expected. Bathroom amazing. Walls, however, paper thin, which is why I can barely string a sentence together in this review.",1,1
This is a fairly new property I think. It is a German company and has most of the amenities you would want. It is priced on the budget minded side so it won't break your bank. Location is really good. Near the Royal Mile and Waverley station without being too noisy. Very easy to walk to everything we wanted to do. Has WiFi but we did have to re-log in every day.,1,1
"First time at this group of hotels. Pretty new, only one in UK, another to open in Edinburgh and one in London. Rooms not very big but great price and location for a weekend in Edinburgh. Rooms clean, comfortable, good shower and free wifi!",1,1
"Location location location!   Motel One is just right in the middle of everything. To one side you have the New town and the main trains station ( and right in front of the airport bus)  and on the other side the beautiful old town of Edinburg.   The room was small but clean and with all you need.  The bathroom was also small but nice and clean and the shower was big and good! Next to the bed there is a European plug (CC 7/7) so we actually didn't need to use our adapter.   The beed was to hard for my back and I prefer the bed more soft, but I will still come back to Edinburgh and Motel One.",1,1
"A hotel that has all the basics that you'd need - no additional fuss. For the price we paid, I'd say this place is actually pretty good value. The location is super central and it's easy to get to everywhere from here! It's also right next to the airport shuttle bus and train station, so transport is also easy.   The insides is a bit of a maze depending on where your room is located - you may have to go down to go up to go back down again to get to your room! But no bother, it's good for walking off the chips and sobering from your drinks.",1,1
"Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover.  Breakfast is ok, but not more.  Service is friendly.  No twin rooms available..",1,1
"I really do love the Germans. This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here.   Motel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately Â£69/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.  Location is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.  My room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days.   Random: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone. Well, you know, also the really good value and the pristine conditions. But definitely the hairdryer.",1,1
"Motel One sets the standard for budget hotels. I stayed at the Dusseldorf branch a while ago so when I saw one in Edinburgh, I knew this was the place to book. We managed to get a reservation during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and only booked a few weeks before. We did pay a premium over the normal rate but given the crowds in the city during this time, it was still a good deal compared to other hotels.  Staff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional. We received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus.  Free wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength.  The buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee.  If I am looking for a reasonable hotel in a city, Motel One will be by first choice.",1,1
"For being fairly ""fast"" food.. Pei Wei (pronounced pay way I confirmed haha) is pretty darn good. we got a few things to share. I had the Asian chicken salad and was impressed! There was a decent amount of chicken. Some more veggies would be nice, but overall pretty good. The steak teriyaki was great as well as the fried rice. Over all good was good! Nice, clean, and reasonable.",1,1
"I decided to try it out, I'm celiac and therefore can only eat gluten free... They have an easy to understand GF Menu with anything you can possibly want.  I placed my order online and picked the exact pickup time. I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami!  I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again! I did see a huge line at the store, so try doing an online order and pickup forsure!  p.s. they even include GF soy sauce!",1,1
"Super clean restaurant and friendly staff. FRESH food. Hasn't been sitting under heat lamps. NO MSG, this is the good stuff. I have to have the Kung Pao Chicken weekly.",1,1
"Found this the other night.  It is the PF Chang fast food option and it worked perfectly for us.  Limited menu, but lower prices. Very basic decor, but clean and fast seating.  Lettuce Wraps just as good as Chang's.  Very busy, especially the take out.  Glad to have it close",1,1
"This review is based upon consistency of flavor and great customer service.  We came and there was an unknown issue that required a 25 minute wait for food.  The employee notified us, and although hesitant, we decided to stay.  We have been here numerous times before in the past years so we are familiar with this location.  The employee was apologetic and gave us a free drink.  That was a simple gesture but rarely do you see decent customer service anymore.  We received our food and had an issue with an incorrect order.  It was explained and the issue was resolved quickly.  They gave us a free appetizer.  We do not expect perfection, nor free food.  This restaurant cares for customers and works to provide a positive experience.  We would return again because they have good food and they care.  That is a rarity in today's restaurant culture.  Kudos to the manager for creating this culture.  Ordered- fried rive and Tofu, edamame, won ton soup, dynamite chx, and Thai curry chx",1,1
I love this place i'd recommend it to anyone ! We always order it togo and it never disappoints! The food always taste fresh and is always ready on time! Definitely our favorite lunch spot !,1,1
"1st! Place is not closed. There was an issue with legal workers in the franchise chain. Now they are back! Food is one of the best! Especially their chicken mango! Daughter is a huge PF Chang fan, so she loves this place also! Her favorite is their Mongolian beef, and noodles! They are always coming up with something new, so you may have to try them more then a few times.",1,1
"As a vegetarian, it can difficult to find places with good options, but I love getting a tofu bowl at Pei Wei. The first time I had it, I had to double check because it looks and has a similar texture to meat, but it's great. I love going to Pei Wei",1,1
"I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs.  This is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much, especially since it's more of a counter service experience.",1,1
"Great fresh food and clean restaurant. Friendly and very accommodating staff. I'm a frequent visitor. This is a sister restaurant to PF Chang's, but without the formality or higher prices. Great place to eat if you want the same style foods as PF Chang's, but a more laid back environment without the need to dress up or spend more.",1,1
"The hubs and I dined at the Glendale location about two years ago. i guess we were hoping it was like PF Chang's....but unfortunately were dissapointed.  We discovered the Surprise location a couple weeks ago and decided that tonight we would grab a quick bite. The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my ""tried and true"" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken."" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!  Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...  As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days.   Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise! (or they have a patio you can dine from)",1,1
"I went to Surprise Pei Wei Restuarant tonight on Bell.  This was my first visit to a Pei Wei.  I was very impressed with the atmosphere, food and staff.  The chicken teriyaki with fried rice was DELICIOUS.  The spring rolls were delicious too!  Your Pei Wei location is my new fav restaurant..",1,1
I like Pei Wei overall and enjoy their varied menu selections.  The food is good and fresh.  Sometimes it's hard to find a place to sit though.,1,1
"The food is great and customer service is the best! The Dan Dan noodles are dynamite but they come standard pretty spicy...  I placed a pick up order by phone and asked for them to be mild, but they ended up being  spicy!  When I got home and tried to eat them they were too spicy.  I called in and spoke to the manager and he took care of it completely and replaced the order for me at no charge!",1,1
Always on point. I get the Carmel chicken.. The crab wontons are a guilt must have. And I love there  tea too. Ate her for two years and always pleased. Thx!,1,1
I love Pei Wei. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is chill. The restaurant was clean and staff friendly.,1,1
"Came here with my friend today cause we were starving and decide to go whichever next place we saw. And we were very surprised at how pretty the inside of the restaurant looked. The decor was amazing. I ordered the Japanese teryaki bowl vegetarian style and it was amazing. I loved the tofu and the brown rice and the veggies. My friend ordered the lo mein and she loved it. We didn't finish due to the fact that the portions are huge. (we didn't know it was a like share the bowl type of place, and when we figured it out we didn't do it because hers had meat). But overall this place was amazing. The employees are very very nice! And this place is vivid and just amazing. WAY better than panda express. I will definately come here again, and recomend it to everyone!!!",1,1
Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's.,1,1
The food was fantastic! I highly recommend  the lettuce wraps.,1,1
"Then we went to dinner at Pei Wei. Not bad for an Asian fusion place. Filled with senior citizens, but that's not all that surprising. I had the Mango Thai Shrimp, apparently, which was good. Right amount of spice in the dish. Not too heavy, either. Steve and Chris had their own plates as well, both of which looked appetizing. Not crazy about the moderate wait nor the fact that strangers came up to the table with unnecessary parenting advice for Steve and Chris.",1,1
"We use them to cater family get-togethers. Love the vegetarian dishes, especially the baked tofu- yum!  The Mongolian beef is a favorite with family.  When we dine in we always get the lettuce wrap.",1,1
I love their food. I have gone there multiple times and still think it's great. I especially love their soda machine.  The Mongolian Beef dish is my absolute favorite.,1,1
All around great flavor and portions. Perfect for take-out always consistent the fam eats here about three times a month never had a bad meal.,1,1
"The vegetarian options are pretty good, especially if you like tofu. The restaurant was out of napkins the last time I was there and the staff was friendly. I would recommend the take-out option versus dining in though.",1,1
"Pretty good food a chain. You do get a lot of food for the price. However, every time I have ordered online there has been a mistake. Sometimes they tell me they never even received my order when I received the confirmation email. Also, if you in during a busy time and have a teenage girl as a cashier, you're chances of having a pleasant experience with her are slim to none. This has happened to me multiple times with multiple different cashiers. I have spoken to the manager and he is always very apologetic, but I guess you just can't get stressed teenage girls to be nice to customers. I will continue to go here as the food is good for the price and they are relatively quick with preparation. Nice options if you're veggies as well.",1,1
I love the food and the containers it comes in. We eat there sometimes and also carry out. My favorite is ginger beef broccoli! Thank you for the emails especially. I really appreciate it,1,1
"Pei Wei has become a favorite ""take out"" spot for both myself and my girl friend.  We drive a little further than the local Taco Bell - KFC combination fast food stop, but to eat healthier it is certainly worth our time.   Yesterday, after our Silver Crafting Class, we drove the 2.4 miles and not only enjoyed a relaxing healthy lunch, but then purchased ""take home"" orders so we would have our evening meal in the refrigerator waiting.  (I brought my husband home an order of his favorite Kung Po Chicken with brown rice.)    If you haven't give Pei Wei a try, stop in some time. I believe you'll enjoy it -- that is, IF, you enjoy Asian dishes.",1,1
"It's just above average.  Portions are decent and cost was ok.  Got in and out fast by phoning our order in.  Good was ok, it didn't floor me but it didn't make me not want to there again.",1,1
I love the lettuce wraps here. They are simply the best.  I order carry out often from here. I occasionally dine in.  My problem with the dinning in is the seating. It is always difficult to find a seat.  The place really needs to expand.  If you have a party of more than 4 most days you can hang it up.  Other than the seating I like it. Large portions of rice and noodles.  A little stingy on the meat.,1,1
"Hot,vegan,carbo load  You name it and they have it Pricing is reasonable  and quality excellent  No disappointments here Five stars for the food  We try to stop by monthly",1,1
"I eat regularly (3-5 times a month) at Pei Wei, usually in Scottsdale or North Phoenix. My wife's doctor is across the street from this Pei Wei, so we have been stopping in when we go to her baby check ups. It is, without a doubt, the best Pei Wei I have eaten at. It is consistent, they don't get frustrated if you customize your order, and the cooks on always on point.   Wish this location was closer!",1,1
"This Pei Wei location has such kind, welcoming staff. They are so accommodating and hospitable. 5 stars, hands down.",1,1
"Pei Wei is a fast, easy, cheaper PF Chang's - and that's what makes it great! If you like the tofu dishes at PF Chang's, you'll love Pei Wei. The food here is great. The service is exceptional. And the portions are huge! I usually end up taking about half the food home with me. Also, compared to other lunch spots near by (like Paradise Bakery), it's really not all that busy. Of course, it's not authentic Asian food, but you shouldn't be expecting that when you come here anyway.",1,1
I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was great food for the price.  Quite impressed by the variety of options on the menu. Not sure if this location was the one I tried.,1,1
"Absolutely wonderful. This place is clean, the staff is wonderful and go out of their way to help you. They stay a step ahead of you and get what what you need.   The food is perfect! I have eaten here many many times and it has always been fresh, hot, and delicious! I highly recommend this place, 100%!",1,1
Service is a 4  . Very sloppy also the hot and sour soup aint that  bad if u add enough chile paste and salt and soy sauce the gentleman named pop he is the manager great service from him and this other lady did not get her name unfortunetly  I've changed my rating 2 times that's how impressed I am,1,1
We are from the Midwest and are visiting Phoenix on a vacation. We stopped in this place for some quick Asian food. What a great surprise! I had the Mongolian chicken and it was great. Very similar to PF Chang. You order at the counter and they bring the food. I wish we had one of these where I live.,1,1
Enjoyed the bright fun Mexican decor!  The food was delicious and reasonably priced!  And the margaritas were delicious!,1,1
I've been here at least 5 times now and each time is better than the last. I Iove what they have done to improve the building and add outdoor dining. Service is always good here and on par with other top places in Mentor. I really suggest the chicken soup on a cold day it's very yummy! Everything I've had on the menu has been great.,1,1
"Terrific service. The place was packed, but we were seated right away. Chips and salsa on the table as we were seated. Great food, big portions, fast service.",1,1
"Ate here for lunch on a Sunday.  Arrived around 12:30, and there were a decent number of customers seated.  Service was friendly and fast, food was excellent, and they have DRAFT BEER, including a couple of Mexican brews.  This location is the best Don Tequila I have been to.",1,1
Been dining here since it first opened. Wife is from tx so this is her taste of home. When tx folks come to visit they ask to go to Don's.  It's very good tex-mex.,1,1
"If you have a hankering for Mexican, head on over to don tequilas. Fast service and delicious food with generous portions. We ordered the Guadalajara special tamale and the pollo adobe and they were both delicious.",1,1
"I eat here all the time and most of the staff are from Guadalajara.... Food is definately ""americanized"" and by that i mean tamed down in heat and changed a little for what americans expect.... But when i order my racos de carne asada with lime and cilantro and onions.... All i get are big smiles and HOT sauce.... So if your in the mood for authentic hotmexican food.... Just let the waiter know.. Hell guide you to a great choice!",1,1
"Very good, reasonable priced . The Texas quesadilla with chicken,  Steak, shrimp, onion, peppers and cheese was large and very good They have Dos Equis on draft!",1,1
What a surprise!  The most amazing Mexican food I have ever tasted and I am a foodie. My husband and I ordered the table side guac.  Delicious!   Texas margaritas. Delicious!  Seafood burritos with fresh cilantro!  I will be salivating for them soon!  All of the food was so fresh!  You must try this place. We will try the Green Road location next as it is closer to our home.,1,1
"We came here for the first time to celebrate my birthday.  We ate a ton of fresh chips in advance of the meal, the salsa was pretty mild.  I had the Chori pollo, which is a burrito with chorizo and chicken with rice.  Man, it was amazing. Hot and spicy with peppers, I took some of the huge portion home and ate it the next day.    The service was seriously, amazingly fast for a group of 4, and they kept our drinks regularly filled.",1,1
"Yum!!! I love this place! Come almost every Friday. Try the Chicken Chili Verde, my first favorite dish. My new favorite, Burrito Chipotle!!!! So delicious! Don't forget the margaritas!! :)",1,1
"We've eaten here 2-3 times a month for the last few years. It's my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. I've never had a meal I didn't like! The menu is so huge and full of options, even your pickiest eaters should be able to find something they can enjoy.  I love how quickly the meals come out, which is especially nice when you're on your lunch hour. The portions are always great, and the staff treats us like family each time we stop in!",1,1
"Amazing Mexican place!! Very tasty and reasonably priced. We ordered Molacajete, seafood chimi and carne asada burrito. The best!! Molacajete is a must try! This is something new I have never tried before. Service is quick! Cute authentic decor.",1,1
"Service is great. Food is texmex and very good. I wish they offered black beans, I'm from California where black beans are popular. Margaritas are great, I got a buzz from two. The place was busy. Mexican families were here  and that's a plus.",1,1
"With everywhere else packed on a Friday night, we wondered in, not expecting much quite honestly.   We both ordered off the specials menu, and my husband barely managed to squeeze in his standard 'where's my burrito' before two large plates, overflowing with food, arrived in front of us.  The food itself was good. Mexican food can too easily be greasy, but this was not. The menu is nothing startling, but the classic mexican dishes were all on the mark. And there was enough left over for a second meal tomorrow.  Prices were very reasonable - our total bill, including tips, was less than $25.  Definitely planning another visit.",1,1
"On a recent trip to Kirtland, OH.  Decided to try even though the outside appearance was somewhat questionable.  But nice simple decor inside.  Friendly waitress who gave good tips from the menu.  We both had the Tres Amigos.  Nice chicken, steak, shrimp combo.",1,1
"If you blink. You will miss this little eatery, squished into the corner of a small strip mall in Mentor, Ohio.  I went with a friend of mine from the area, who was treated like a rock star when he arrived (well, he IS a rock star), and that's indicative of the casual and familial vibe at this restaurant.  I didn't take notes - too busy enjoying the company - but I'm pretty sure I got a burrito and it was delicious.  Margaritas were excellent (this much I do remember) and service was quick and pleasant.  Now that I know that this place exists, it gives me even more reason to travel to the northern tip of Ohio for good company and eats!",1,1
"Good food, great prices, large portions, fast, friendly service. What more can you ask for. We highly recommend you try it!",1,1
"Authentic. Delicious chips and salsa follow you to the table on arrival - food arrives on plates too hot to touch. We lived in the South West for 9 years and ate at many Mexican places ONCE, before calling DonnyTs our favorite. We have been enjoying perfect food here for 6 plus years. Very little turn over in wait or kitchen staff... consistent quality food and service.",1,1
"Why hello service. Don't let the lime green walls scare you, this place is all business. Seated immediately, the waiter came to the table immediately, and the food came almost immediately after we'd ordered. Boyfriend got a combo platter with an enchilada and taquito and devoured the whole thing. I got a carnitas dinner platter and I could only finish half since I filled up on chips and salsa and guacamole. It was so good!   The only disappointing part was the dessert. We ordered flan, and when it arrived it was covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce which I am not a fan of. The consistency was nubbly. Should've went with the churros.",1,1
"This is our go to Mexican restaurant. The staff is kind and courteous and Javier is an amazing gentleman. Always prompt , fresh and delicious. Their mango margaritas and dos Equis pair perfectly with our meals. Very family friendly and great atmosphere. Really a great place",1,1
"Food was AWESOME. The normal tacos are ... well ... normal and typical. My wife ordered the chicken fajitas and they were very good fajitas. I ordered the burrito durango which was a 12 inch shell STUFFED with chicken, steak, and huge shrimp! I asked for it spicy... and it actually came with pretty good heat. The burrito was outstanding, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. Overall, we'll probably be back.",1,1
Food is always great especially Tableside Gauc but today service was really slow because of kitchen. Waiter couldn't have been nicer,1,1
"We had a really good meal here, service was quick and accurate.  Food was definitely better than most Mexican places around.  Margaritas were very good.  Most of all, the place was very clean!  Would definitely go again!",1,1
"Went on a saturday night on the first night of summer, and had a party of 12.   We were sat almost immediately.  Went there because they had catered a party of a friend of mine.  Our server was professional, and bilingual.  But you could totally understand him and had a cool accent.  Americanized i suppose.  They do not use a POS system but use an old paper check system...so separate checks becomes an issue.  They put tons of chips and salsa in front of you...the chips are super crunch but almost no salt, and the salsa was bland for my taste.  I had the el paso speciai; beef tip burrito and chicken burrito w/ rice and beans.  All came out hot but a little watery.  Dunno where that came from.  But I did ask for lettuce/tomato set as it did not come with any in or on it.  Kids food came out fast, they did have the world cup and that seemed to distract the waiters...but as far as Mexican food goes it was pretty good for Mentor.",1,1
"Been here a couple times and so far every time we've gone the foods been great, the service has always been friendly and the portions are amazing!",1,1
Tacos al pastor--delish! Salsa and guacamole was very fresh! Refried beans were super good. Service was friendly and fast. Beer was cold and the bathroom was clean. What more can you ask for?,1,1
We've been going here several times a month ever since they opened. Some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever had at absolutely the LOWEST prices I have ever found for food this good. Waiters friendly and attentive. Nice decor. Nice new Bar.,1,1
"Love this place. I went there with me boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I am glad my colleagues suggested me this place. The food is really really good. They have a great cocktail list.   We shared the hot balls (delicious) and the rillettes (I loved it). Then, I had the beef tartare with the side of potatoes cooked in duck fat (awesome). To finish, I had the lemon pannacotta...this is by far one of the best dessert I've tried. I am not a dessert person and not a big fan of lemon but that dessert was just perfect!!   The service was slow so don't go there if you are in a rush! Our waiter was really nice  and even tried to speak in French as he noticed that we were speaking French.   I will definitely go back there...I am sad this place is kind of far from were I live!",1,1
"Had a lovely evening last night at Table 17.  Great selection of wine and the owner made an excellent suggestion of something we had never heard of before - bearing in mind both price point, meal choices and preferences (though overall it was a bit of a pricey list, only one bottle south of $50, just).    Lovely, vibrant atmosphere, the polenta was delicious as a starter (the chef tops it with a different finish every day - last night it was meatballs) - though the other ones we saw at other tables also looked sumptuous - and our meals/sides were excellent.  Also, the food prices  All in all a great evening  - could have happily ordered anything from the menu, and what we did order was delish.     Definitely will go back to work our way through the rest of the menu.",1,1
"I've been here for a few dinners and brunches, and it has been a pleasure every time.   The service has always been very attentive and helpful. For one of the dinners, our group had trouble deciding on dishes so our server suggested that we pick a price point and let the chef put together a menu. It was a really fantastic experience!",1,1
"Ok, full disclosure:  went here as a default because Ascari Enoteca was closed down due to a busted water pipe or something.   Food was AMAZING!  We ordered a bunch of appetizers and 3 mains, as well as dessert and cocktails......thought for sure we would get something that we did not like, but alas everything was delicious.  To quote an obnoxiously catchy song from The Lego Movie, ""Everything is awesome....""",1,1
"We had an exceptional experience at Table 17. Chef John prepared an incredible fois gras app, the squid ceviche did not disappoint... the Rainbow trout was melt in your mouth delicious and we ended our foodgasm with the dark chocolate tort.",1,1
"Found this place by chance and walked in for brunch on a Sunday. There was one table available luckily. There wasn't a lot on the menu, but all the items we ordered wew so fabulous!! And very out of the ordinary. Service was good too.  French toast with creme anglais, pastry shell with onions, pears etc... all fabulous. It's a delight for the senses, this place.",1,1
By far my favourite restaurant in the east end. Always great food and service - and a cool and inspired cocktail list. Great for any occasion!,1,1
"I booked the private room for a small wedding reception recently. We had 14 guests, the room was perfect. Booking was incredibly easy and they took care of everything professionally and quickly. We were even able to come in the night before and decorate.   The dinner was amazing. We had the family style menu, which included: kale citrus salad, buffalo mozzarella, hunters mash, green beans, polenta with lamb bolognese, braised lamb shank, short ribs... There was more, but you get it. Lots of food for every one, lots to choose from, and so amazingly delicious. Everyone stopped talking at one point, they we're too busy eating.  We had a cake of our own brought in, so we got to take the dessert from the menu home. It was amazing, so decadent.  It was a fantastic dinner at the end of a fantastic day. I don't think I could have picked a better place to host my wedding meal.  My favourite was the polenta bolognese. I could eat that for days.",1,1
"I had a nice time at Table 17.  It was busy when we got there. We had reservations but had to wait at the bar (no big deal) and the bartender (he's in his early 100s) was a riot.  I had the polenta to start. It was creamy and buttery, and the braised pork shoulder in white wine on top was oh-so-good.  I had the short ribs as my main. The meat was tender and moist and the root veggies were perfectly cooked.  We shared the hunters mash as a side - I was expecting more flavour.  Table 17 had a great vibe to it. The food was good. The servers were attentive. I'd definitely go back.",1,1
"We had the scotch egg and the tomato based eggs. Everything was delish! While I prefer to have my bread toasted I understand it's not the french way (and they would have accommodated if I asked!)  The potato rosti was totally worth breaking the diet for, and comes in 4 pieces and is easily shared!  The americano was outstanding they use amazing beans, and I wanted more. I had on of their $5 mimosas which is something that would keep me coming back weekly if I could !  The staff are all super lovely, and the ingredients were all do fresh (you can tell these things) A perfect brunch spot, no need to wait in line at the other two ""brunch hot spots"" in the area.   Highly recommend this spot!",1,1
my first time here. Very impressed. Food was very tasty. Our waiter recommended me the Trout and it was amazing. So fresh. It came with a side of vegetables and i got some steak fries with it as well.  The service was pretty spot on and we were always asked if  everything was o.k...which it was.,1,1
"Walked in on a cold saturday afternoon round 1330! waitress Helen received us very warmly and sat us at the best table for two by the window in the sun with view onto queen st east. We started with mimosas while studying the brunch menu. Helen was helpful, knowledgeable  and prompt. I ordered the seasonal scramble, which today was chorizo artisanal, and tarragon scrambled fluffyly together with country butter toast. Loved it. My girlfriend had the french toast, cinnamon creme anglaise and berries which she thought was pretty good. We then asked for a cheese plate which was only available for dinner. Helen accommodated us with it anyway: *Paillot de chevre *Mapledale 5 year cheddar *Ciel de charlevoix *Monforte toscano pecorino *Clandestin  Great little figs stuffed with walnuts dry crannies and almonds A good bottle of sancerre and ""Voila"" $118 for the both of us will come back, loved it!",1,1
"I've had the pleasure of dining at Table 17 on two occasions. One time we were a group of four and another time it was just me and my husband. The place is simple but beautiful - gorgeous reclaimed wood, candlelit tables and lush fabrics. It just feels good when you walk in. The staff on both visits were very friendly and attentive, and both times the meals were excellent. Their prix fixe meal is tremendous value for the quality of the food you get although just a heads up that some of the dishes are very rich, so go easy on the apps! (re: get yourself a nice salad if you order the short ribs or risotto). If you're feeling like a cocktail to start the meal (and who wouldn't?) I'd suggest the Bourbon sour. Yummy.",1,1
"I'm going to ignore the fact that the service was off and just chock that up to the fact that it was the poor girl's first week, so the cocktail spilled, the flatware dropped and the general feeling that the girl was nervous as all get out didn't really taint my evening because the food was excellent.   Our group started off with the polenta special, a strong recommendation from the friends that suggested Table 17. As I understand it, the polenta to start rotates nightly... maybe weekly? This particular night it was served with some seasoned pork and Parmesan cheese. Thumbs way up for the polenta, the pork on the other hand... eh. Didn't have a tremendous amount of flavor. But no worries. Our entrees were bomb. Fish, filet, sides I don't think you can go wrong, and I highly suggest grabbing things everyone will like because you'll want to start forking at your neighbor's! I was impressed this place had such a strong cocktail program, figured wine was where it's at, at a place like this.",1,1
"I love this place.  It's definitely a little pricey, so it's more of a special occasion place.  Love the dÃ©cor.  They have a gigantic table in the center of the restaurant where they slice your bread.  Kinda cool, but it takes up a lot of useful real estate.  Another 2 or 3 tables could potentially be in it's place.  The ""hot balls"" were highly recommended by a friend so we just had to order them.  I can't say I've ever had anything like them before.  There are 3 different types:  Arancino - mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - wildflower honey, and Arancino - spiced lamb stuffed risotto.  A little expensive for the size of these things, but delicious.  I went with the fish (trout) for my entrÃ©e.  It was very good.  Nothing special or unique to report.  I was very impressed with the service here.  I've recommended this restaurant to others, and they've loved it too.",1,1
"I came here for weekend brunch. We arrived around 11:30 and there was no wait, lots of free tables. It was packed by 12 or 12:30 though.   The place is cozy and inviting. It's nice enough for a romantic dinner (NB: Sunday and Monday nights they have a $32 three-course table d'hote, and bring your own wine) but relaxed enough for families with young kids. The chicken theme (in the logo, decor) reminded me of the old Bistro Bakery Thuet.   The brunch menu changes seasonally, so the current offerings are different from the menu on the website. I had the scrambled eggs -- smooth and fluffy with pecorino cheese and mixed peppers. It came with a green salad and warm baguette. It was filling without being too heavy or greasy. My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles. We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty. It's chunkier than the rosti at Le Petit Dejeuner, but not as thick as the rosti at Richtree/Movenpick. For drinks, I just had a glass of the freshly squeezed OJ. They do have $5 mimosas and caesars. DC had coffee, which was refilled diligently.   The whole meal for 2 people came to $40 including tax and tip. Pretty reasonable for a nice place and great food. Service was friendly and attentive.   Street parking on weekends is usually easy to find and $1.50 per hour.   I checked-in and unlocked and offer for $36 for a ""14 oz. (!!) Heritage Beef Ribeye with hen of the woods mushrooms and mint & orange gremolata"" for my next visit.",1,1
"I'll be frank: the only way we could afford this place was due to a gift certificate from a generous wedding guest. However, the food was right on the money. Good flavor; prompt service. If you have the money, go!",1,1
"We were here for brunch a few weeks back - delish !  Service was great, food was fantastic, and as a nice surprise we didn't have to wait all that long for a table.  And a good brunch can't just rely on its food for good reviews, so the answer is yes, the Ceasars were awesome.  We don't really live in the area but our visit here was really good so we'll be back.",1,1
"Had a very lovely meal here on Saturday. Came at 6:30 and it wasn't busy but filled up by the time we left. The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it's the food that counts! We had... Hot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished. Polenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously. Steak tartare w/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them!  Will I be back? Yes! None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid.",1,1
"One of my favourite restaurants in the neighbourhood. Food is consistent and the service impeccable.   The steak frites are the best in the city. Scallops, duck confit and short ribs are also regular favourites.",1,1
"Literally my FAVORITE new restaurant in the northern hemisphere. I've all but given up on Toronto until finding this gem through a friend in New York who raved about it.  Took my vegetarian children for dinner, and we had an absolutely outstanding experience.  Everything from the friendly and funny staff, to the custom vegetarian dinner that the teens devoured, was spectacular.  The highlights: Hot balls, Brussel Sprouts, Diver scallops, Tartare, and the pasta was so light and tender with incredible delicate flavors Kudos. We'll be back soon!",1,1
"The first time I came to Table 17 was a little over a year ago. I took my grandmother and my aunt out for dinner. The moment I came to this place I was very impressed.   Firstly, it was very conveniently located to us. Secondly, it has this very home-y feel and decor. Nothing felt overwhelming. We came on a Monday night. (To my knowledge Sunday and Monday nights Table17 offers prix fixe menu.) We all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. Their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can't help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I've asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil. :(   The only thing I found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences.   Overall, I definitely recommend this place. Especially their duck confit which is amazing!   -CL   PS they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them. :)",1,1
"Food: 9.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 9.5/10 Overall experience: 9/10  A lovely experience overall. Went and ordered: - foie gras appetizer - polenta (main #1) - pasta special  All the food was great. You could tell it had been prepared with great care and came out piping hot.  The service was also fantastic. The server was extremely helpful in selecting a wine, and providing recommendations on the menu. We didn't feel pressured at all during the meal to hurry up or order more AKA increase the bill amount.  THE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, and equally as wonderful service.",1,1
"We went on a Travelzoo coupon and we arrived early for our 7:30 reservation. No problem, here's your table. Our server was fantastic! I can't remember his name, unfortunately. He made excellent suggestions, was very helpful, knew all the dishes, and the ingredients. We had the Beef Carpaccio and Squid Ceviche in Gozpacho to start and were blown away by both!  My wife was really looking forward to the lamb shank, which was not on that days' menu, so our server suggested the Venison loin. My wife had never had venison, so it took a little convincing, but she loved it.  It was probably the best venison I've ever tasted. I had the polenta with the wild boar sugo. very good. We also ordered the Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes, which were fantastic.  The wine was very good, and dessert was excellent, Maple Panna Cotta and Sticky Toffee Pudding.  All in all an excellent dining experience.",1,1
"This hidden gem is wonderfully delicious. Ordered from appetizers to entrÃ©. Everything is great. Great service, great food, great environment. Can't complain about a thing here. Even their bathrooms are sparkly clean. Heard They're moving to another location soon or renovating. Better call ahead and ask. Duck confit and their pasta in beurre sauce is mind blowing. Worth a try If you're in the area. Something different for date night.",1,1
"We were back here this evening.  Delish!  I ordered the beef tartare - it was pretty tasty, large enough to share as beef tartare is both an acquired taste and fairly rich on it's own.  My main was the leg of lamb, it was a little well done for my liking, but the flavour was quite nice - the morel mushrooms were loaded with a burst of buttery flavour.    My bf started with scallops, they were quite large for scallops, and quite nice, and had a white fish, not trout, maybe halibut, that was also quite delish.  I love the decor, and upon reading other reviews am super sad that I missed out on a group on!  It was wonderful anyway, and I think a great place to dine.    We went for an early seating (a bit before 6), and I'm happy to report, that next time, I'll either go for another early seating or something later (after 9 in the evening), as it can get quite loud, and that makes it hard to hear your dining companion!",1,1
"Love this restaurant!!! Awesome brunch, $10 for anything on the menu. My hubby doesn't get super full off of the stuff, but I'm good with the amount. Awesome decor too!!",1,1
We went here for Mother's Day brunch.  I had a very good egg omelette with guacamole and my wife had the French toast. Very nice intimate setting and the menu has very nice choices.  We got our son a fresh berry yogurt which I ended up eating most of it because it was so good. My son was still quite happy regardless. We will definitely be back to claim our check in deal but that is not what would bring us back. The exciting dinner menu is why we will be back soon.,1,1
"We had a great time. Dinner for 4 - with a healthy amount of food (or unhealthy - depends on how you look at it).  The polenta had their ""reindeer sauce"" which consisted of venison, spices, and berries. Delicious.   Oysters were tasty, and the braised pork was unbelievably good. No idea what they used for aromatics - but there was a hint of fennel that was incredible.   $400 for 4 people and drinks. Not a value dinner, but enjoyable, and guarantees my return.   Oh. Peanut Butter Panna Cotta. Order it and thank me later. Servers were hilarious, attentive, and accommodating. I just can't see anything wrong with this place.",1,1
"I left Table 17 as pleased as could be last weekend- indulging in the very reasonably priced Sunday night table d'hÃ´te we enjoyed the scallops, salted cod, polenta, boar sausage, panna cotta and gingerbread cookies with eggnog (!) We were particularly wowed by the boar but the entire meal was fabulous.  As a big bonus the place is BYOB with no corkage fees for one or two bottles.  A couple other reviewers noted a lack of attentiveness on the part of the servers- I would contend that our experience was the complete opposite of this. The server was charming, present and exceedingly helpful. Maybe this can be racked up to visiting on an early December Sunday evening? In any case, it was exactly what I was hoping for and more.",1,1
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love that they aren't over-priced (not cheap either, mind you) and that they can usually manage to squeeze you in at the end of the service without a reservation (I'm a late eater.) The appetizers are where it is at here!",1,1
"Had dinner here once and it was ok, but the brunch was great. I had the Sloppy Giuseppe - Two sunny side eggs top a crispy, fried polenta cake, surrounded by a moat of Bolognese sauce. Awesome. I'll definitely be back for that alone.",1,1
"Is the food at Table 17 excellent? Yes.  Is that enough for me to give it five stars? No.  I've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.  Why? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.  The dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as ""Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue""?!   Again I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70.   Thankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can't see why I wouldn't return to Table 17, for a special occasion.   This restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself.",1,1
"Brunchy time and we have a winner.  To start, we got a seat right away on Sunday for brunch.  I highly suggest going around 11:30 as you just miss the 12pm rush.  It is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch.  For my meal, I had the french toast.  It was good - light and perfectly cooked.  The cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream.  There was an assortment of berries as well.  Their orange juice was freshly squeezed and we were in and out in under 45 minutes.   Definitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire!",1,1
"What an experience: from the shabby-chic decor, to the wonderful service, Table 17 was an all-around treat.   First off the ""hot balls"" ( I know, I know), were phenomenal: arancini stuffed with risotto, another with goat cheese, and finally the crab. Each came with their own dipping sauce: amaaazing.  For dinner, the lamb tenderloin with a parsnip puree was cooked to perfection, a friend ordered the steak frites (delish), the beef tartare was tender and spicy and you can't really go wrong with an arugula salad, which was fresh and tasty. The presentation of the halibut wrapped in ramps (mild leek), was a show-stopper (as was the pomegranate mojito).   Great place for a date, for a nice celebration, or just a nice culinary experience.",1,1
"Was here for my first time just last week. Loved it. It was highlighted by the Soft Shell Crab and the Hunter's Mash. Also tried my first pint of Chambly on a recommendation from the bartender. I will be hunting this beer down in other restaurants I visit.  Also, they are very quick to respond to any questions you have via Twitter.",1,1
"Bottom line: great food, cute place, fabulous dinner. Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation.  Went to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault.  Food: The server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.  To start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish.   For my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.  My date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did.   We contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.  Only main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.  Not sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.  Overall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend.",1,1
If you want to have a more quiet place to meet up with your spouses parents for the first time - that's the place to go on a Saturday morning. Make sure to come early as they don't accept reservations for less than groups of 6!!,1,1
"We really enjoyed this place.  Food and service was excellent.  Table 17 has different and unique things to try! I highly recommend the goat cheese balls, they were fantastic!!",1,1
"I went here for the brunch the other day in this little bistro-style restaurant in Leslieville and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.   The restaurant itself has a really cool decor - very minimal but rustic decor, brown paper tablecloths, quaint, romantic tables and nice, high ceilings. I couldn't get over how much personality the restaurant has, especially considering how new it is.   And obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty.   Maybe it's because it's new, but the service was the one thing that didn't make this a 5 star occasion. Our waitress was slow, took forever to take our order and then forgot what we wanted. But the food was so good that it didn't ruin the experience.",1,1
"Great decor, great food, great drinks. Food was really good, not a huge selection on the menu, but it was also a set menu for the night, so can't comment on the normal menu. Food was very tasty, and there was a very different selection of draft beer, all ones I hadn't heard of, but the one I tried was very good. Will definitly be going back!",1,1
"Stopped in right after lunch shift for a couple drinks. Bar tender was really helpful, friendly, and made for a great weekend afternoon drink. That said, they were definitely on the pricey end.",1,1
"I went here with a group of 4 late on a friday night at around 9:30 pm. We had a bottle of wine, foie gras, risotto, the ribeye, and a few other sides. Everything was perfect. Service was great. Prices were not cheap, but worth every bit. This is a place is good for 2 to 4 people who don't mind sharing some delicious plates and paying for quality.",1,1
"PEI oysters with the lime-tequila sauce were great.  The menu on the website was out of date, so the bearnaise I was expecting to have with my steak frites was not available. However, the chimichurri sauce that replaced it was very good.",1,1
"Rarely do I ever venture east of Yonge. It terrifies me. But when my BFF requested we go to Table 17 for her birthday, I put on my big girl pants and made my way to the East. Walking along queen, east of Broadview, I was amazed at how much has changed (I lived on Broadview and Dundas years ago and this was NOT the place to be).   Once we arrived at Table 17 I was really impressed with the overall vibe. Warm, inviting, with minimal segregation from the kitchen to the dining area (I love seeing who's making my meal!).   I had oysters to start and the beef tartare for my main. It was chalked full of flavour. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their dishes as well (Some fish, some pasta... no weak meal was served).   The server was wonderful. He had a great balance of being helpful and present at times and then absent when he wasn't needed.   Great venue... worth making the trek across the yonge street tracks.",1,1
"Had brunch again at Table 17 for a third time and each time it's been better and better.  Last time I had the daily quiche and it was good.  Today I have the Alsatian tart with salad and I enjoyed every bite of it.    I'm really shocked to read all the reviews about bad service.  Having been to this restaurant six or so times now, I have never once encountered any rudeness.  Maybe I've just lucked out.",1,1
"I am reluctant to write a review for Table 17 only because I want it to be Leslieville's best kept secret! I went for brunch with my husband and a friend. For Saturday brunch at prime brunching hour, we were quickly seated. The place wasn't full like all the surrounding places so not only were we served quickly, but we were also not rushed out the door. It made a great easy Saturday morning.   Serving staff were friendly and helpful. We loved that their bread comes from Bonjour Brioche, the best bakery east of the Don! My tart was so flaky and warm. Great sweet and savoury flavours in an appropriate portion for brunch. Everyone's plates were well-presented.   The decor had rustic charm and we didn't feel crammed in like many small brunch spots.   Our coffees and water were constantly refilled and I spent an easy afternoon sitting and catching up with friends. What more can you ask for to make an enjoyable and easy-going Saturday brunch?   I would definitely return to Table 17.",1,1
"The only downside about this place is that somehow I've only just discovered it!  My friend and I walked in around 11:00am on a Saturday after a workout. The restaurant was reasonably busy but there was no line-up - a welcome change for weekend brunch in Leslieville/Riverdale! The interior is dark wood/brick and quite cozy. Realistically, we were a little under-dressed for the occasion but they welcomed us in any event.  My friend had a dish (whose name escapes me) but consisted of eggs served on bolognese sauce on top of polenta. I had the quiche with a tomato salad. Both were really fantastic. Brunch entrees were reasonably priced at about $10.  During our meal we saw a server walk by wih an order of frites and quickly decided we had to order them. No regrets here - crispy, salty, and delicious! At $4, totally worth it.  I would absolutely return and recommend.",1,1
"Dropped in on a Sunday for Table 17's BYOW Table D'Hote.  There was a '96 Bourdeaux that just had to be drunk and so my friend and I spent a lovely Sunday evening dinner obliging.   Table D'hote gives you a  selection of pork belly, steak frites, trout and a vegetarian option with a selection of first courses and desserts to go with it.   Neither of our dishes disappointed.   What we got was high quality, well prepared bistro fare at a very reasonable price.  Service was efficient if not overly friendly.   I remain a fan of this cosy Queen East bistro and wouldn't think twice about many repeat visits.",1,1
"The fish croquette, pork belly and collard greens price fixe for $35 were to die for. Uncorking two bottles of Chateauneuf du Pape for free was simply priceless.  I am just not used to actually getting such value for money at restaurants in Toronto.",1,1
"Nice atmosphere with good food and attentive service.  The much-touted hot balls appetizers are a little over-rated: they are basically breaded, deep-fried balls of something with dipping sauce and were edible but nothing to write home about.  For entrees we had the delicious beef short ribs and black cod.  Both were cooked to perfection and in manageable portions (I often feel that mediocre fine-dining restaurants throw large portions at you to compensate for weak flavour).  $250 for 4 people with some booze.",1,1
"This was a nice little surprise.  My Friend and I were planning on going to The Comrade which is 4 units West of Table 17 but their food selection was limited.  The Comrade bartender recommend this place so we thought we'd give it a whirl.    There was a good feel to this two roomed restaurant, classy but not fancy.  There was a long wooden table in the middle of the 2nd room where the wait staff cut bread and got their serving supplies from which I thought was a nice touch.  The waitress we had was extremely helpful in her recommendations, both in food and drink and cute as could be.  I will return.",1,1
"Table 17 is a truly awesome restaurant and worth a visit. My girlfriend and I stumbled across it for brunch one weekend and were impressed. We then returned for Sunday dinner and realized they have no corkage fees that evening, what a nice surprise.  The people running this restaurant get it, down to every detail. The servers are very friendly and helpful. The decor is nice, nothing overdone, just comfortable and 'rustic chic' which fits the type of place they are and food they serve.   Speaking of food, it's the best part. I don't have a high end palate, but I can say that I enjoyed every dish and felt the pricing was fair. Servings were generous so you won't come away hungry.   Bravo guys. Bra-vo.",1,1
"We're regulars here. Delicious brunchs! Delicious dinners! Service is quick and helpful. Is a dressed-up/relaxed place. Bonjour Brioche have a line, come here!!!",1,1
"Appetizer: Hot Balls: Arancino - Mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - with wildflower honey, Arancino - Spiced lamb stuffed risotto with mint My friend asked me which one is which as she could not decipher. The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17.   Diver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce bÃ©arnaise & guanciale I liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the bÃ©arnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale.   EntrÃ©e:  Haddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish Perhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough.   Dessert:  Lemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom!   In the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease. We are definitely anomalies here. Table 17 had garnered a lot of loyal patrons over the years. I really wanted to fall in love with this cosy little restaurant!",1,1
"I am a fairly regular dinner guest at Table 17, and thought it was time to leave a review.  Among the cosy bistros popping up in Leslieville, Table 17 was among the first, and is among the best for its consistency in quality of food and service. I also really appreciate the Sunday & Monday BYOB nights, and wish other restaurants would take Table 17's lead on this generous offering.  I am always happy to see my favourite mains such as the braised beef short ribs and steak frites on the menu (and I happily order them over and over each visit - the fries appear to be crisply double fried in duck fat in traditional Belgian style. Yumm!)   That said, the menu does not seem to have changed very much over the years, and I almost wish they would take that risk and do a bit of a menu refresh. I still give it 4 stars because I go there when I crave my favourites. When I'm feeling adventurous, I just go a little further west on Queen to Ruby Watchco.",1,1
"Very good food and great atmosphere, friendly service. Bottom line: impossible to go wrong with a visit.",1,1
"Went to a Brunch party and it was so cool and awesome, the food and service where amazing and the stuff where so funny!!   Know I here is shut down and closed that's sad :(",1,1
"What a relaxed place to enjoy a nice dinner. Table 17 is intimate, split into two rooms.  The service is very personal but not invasive.  Tonight we got the right amount of attention without feeling rushed.   The menu is well edited with interesting selections. We choose the artichokes and  bocconcini as the starters followed by venison and steak tartare, with sides of amazing Brussels sprouts and frites. All excellent, but the venison was truly a standout.   I have been here a couple of times, but tonight was the best. Certainly will return.",1,1
"I think the main problem with this place is that it is too small to accommodate people who may want to hang out after dinner and have a few drinks. There is a bar, but it's small.   As for the food: quality ingredients, food cooked simply, and the right way. The trout was prepared perfectly. Overdone fish can be a problem, but not here.   The food was also not over-seasoned, which is one of my peeves with restaurant food in general. The flavors of the foods themselves are predominant here. Not that I don't enjoy spice, but there is a balance.  The duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan. I'm not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that's how subtle the flavors can be, but  I loved it. Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat. Would have bought a quart of the pickles if we had room in our luggage.   The duck-fatted mash was bit too heavy for me that night, but my fiance had no trouble finishing it off. They give you a good heaping pile.  The greens were perfect to me--again, very simply prepared.   The arugala salad had the perfect amount of dressing on it. A little too much goat cheese on it for me though, could have been balanced more in that way for me.   We might even go back before we leave Toronto  to try the Polenta, which unfortuntely they were out of.",1,1
"Table 17 is a quaint find in Leslieville village perfect for a good catch up with your girlfriends or a dinner date.  The restaurant is divided into two rooms - the first room you walk into features a long bar and some seating and the room towards the side which we get seated in, is simple, farmhouse chic.  The menu has amazing sharing plates and we do choose a couple to start with.  We were very impressed with the presentation of the polenta du jour dish.  This is a must at Table 17!  The fluffy, white polenta, dished out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by the chef who ladled a ""ragu"" of steaming lamb on top of it. There was chili and dried basil on little spoons for more flavour.  It was heart-warming, a generous portion - ideal for our group of 3.  The lamb ragu was flavourful and the polenta with some grated Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper was still light as air. As a note, Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees with decent prix fix menu on offer",1,1
"I had a groupon certificate for Table 17 and I'm not usually one to purchase groupons unless it's a place I really want to try or already like, We walked in without reservations, which I am also not prone to doing, but they had a small table available that was out of the way and quiet.  I've heard others complain about the service here. I found it to be fabulous, and I'm in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails. Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.  The hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.  Desserts looked fab, although we were too full, but I loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. Delicious.  Overall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!!  P.S. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this.",1,1
"Had dinner with some colleagues on Monday Dec 30, 13.  The food was ah-ma-zing!!  In addition it was BYOW night and no corkage fee - just some extra special icing on an already delicious cake!  You can't go wrong at table17.",1,1
Came for brunch with my wife and two young boys on a Saturday. We had the scotch eggs and Giuseppe eggs. They have $4 kids meals too. We got the French toast which was two slices with fruits. We also got a side of rosti. Everything was really delicious and unique. I've been searching for a great French toast and this one was right up at the top. Full of flavour but not too heavy. Prices were all pretty reasonable around $10-$12. We'll be coming back for sure!,1,1
What a great little restaurant in Leslieville.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service.  Not too expensive and the the variety on the menu was a nice change from many other restaurants in the city.   Call me a fan. I will definitely go back!,1,1
"I have only been for brunch but was impressed.  Very friendly staff.  Somewhat traditional French brunch menu, and well executed items.  They have some fun cocktails, and the ambiance is great.  The nature of the menu (not traditional brunch obviously) precipitates only infrequent visits (I'm and eggs benny guy on Sunday mornings) but when we go we love it.",1,1
"All hail the mighty Groupon, without which I never would have experienced this place. After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.  Service was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner. The food was excellent and I'm definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I'm totally bringing cash.",1,1
"We've been here for brunch a couple of times. Had the rosti both times, as well as the neapolitan eggs and the weekly scramble. Both times everything has been excellent and the service is great and friendly. Also entirely reasonably priced. Recommended.",1,1
"I've been to Table 17 twice, and since the first time I came here, I have been anticipating the next time I would reunite with the sticky toffee bread pudding! With a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, I knew I had to get in here for what I hoped to be a fantastic dinner.  The tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions I had (I always have questions!)  For our shared appie, we went with the Burrata because I have been looking for a good burrata dish since I moved back to TO and had not found it yet.- I tried one at Reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.  It happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.  On a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.  For dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.  I'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first. As someone who doesn't repeat restaurants often, I can vouch that this one will not disappoint.",1,1
I have been hear a couple of times and overall have enjoyed the food.  I had the trout as my main and it was very fresh and perfectly cooked.  It came with some pretty boring side vegetables but overall the meal was satisfying.  Its a little on the pricey side but our server was great and I enjoy the vibe.,1,1
"Quite a great meal. Came early and even though we booked using OpenTable and it was busy, we were allowed to sit.   Special was Foie gras and said yes before the words were out of the servers mouth. Shared tartare and it was glorious with a very large hint of moutarde, but U dug it. Shoulder of Ontario lamb was great with a hint of mint in the salsa verde. I'm not a dessert guy but the Gateau Elvis with chocolate, caramelized bananas and peanut butter was awshum.   Nice wine list. Will return soon.   Only thing hindering a 5-star is the fact that we had to top up our own wine a couple times.",1,1
My experience with Table 17 were excellent.  I do like the French Countryside deco giving the interior a homey and farmhouse vibe.  We were greeted warmly at the door and the service was really attentive for the whole evening.  We shared:  Lamb Polenta ($14) Duck Confit ($26) Vanilla poached rhubarb ($8)  Everything was well prepared with great care. I even enjoyed my Lamb Polenta and I am not a lamb or polenta lover!  The restaurant did get busy even on a weekday evening. I guess a lot of people were taking advantage of their prix menu $35 during Sunday and Monday with BYOW.  Will definitely return when I am in the neighbourhood.  PS: Thanks Amy L for the invitation,1,1
"wow this place is amazing for brunch, french style cuisine, free parking on side streets even on weekends! bonus! i didn't know there were coupons and deals at this place as I was reading the reviews but I would still pay full price to come here, gotta try dinner someday. good vibe here, good neighbourhood, good food! no line-ups for brunch either",1,1
"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday what a surprise! I had their fresh oysters which were incredible tasted like they were fresh out of the ocean. What I loved the most here was their own homemade olive oil, simply the best olive oil I have tried I can just sit there the whole day having their freshly baked baguettes dipping in their basalmic vinegar and olive oil.   Glad my girlfriend showed me this little place book a reservation today you wont regret it!",1,1
"I had the most wonderful experience at Table 17 recently. I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entrÃ©e. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays.   My boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup.   I ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.  Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon.   I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purÃ©e and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more.   For dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying.  Our other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with crÃ¨me anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious.   It was a delicious meal and a great experience altogether. I can't wait to go back.",1,1
"After trying to find a table at various downtown restaurants downtown and frowned upon for expecting to ""walk-in"" on a Saturday night we happened to find parking (another surprise for a Saturday night) right in front of Table 17 as if it was meant to be. We walked in expecting to be turned away, especially since it was quarter past 10pm,  and were graciously seated at a pretty table by the window. The atmosphere was perfect - mellow but happy crowd lingering over dessert, attentive hostesses dressed casual and candlelight in a rustic contemporary decor.  The menu isn't extensive but offers a good variety to please any dietary preferences. We ordered the soft shell crab to start and it was set on top of a green chutney which elevated the taste of the crab and was just delicious. I had the lemon caper pasta which was really good and my DH ordered the lamb which was falling-off-the-bone goodness on a plate. We finished with the toffee cake dessert and it is high on my list of favorite desserts. It was decadent, luscious and big enough to share (but who wants to!).  A great evening and I am glad we didn't get a table anywhere else - Table 17 rocks!",1,1
"My partner and I went to Table 17 for dinner while on a visit to Toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service.  Our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of Toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about Table 17. The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.  The menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrÃ©e, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  My partner had the steak frites for entrÃ©e, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.  The service was definitely a bright spot here. Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. There's one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they're good. If you care, that one is ...Table 23. ;)",1,1
"I've been a resident here for almost 3 years, and I've been pleased with my time here.  First off, location is great for Scottsdale within walking distance to Sandbar, California Pizza Kitchen, At One Yoga, and a gas station, and plenty of other options within driving distance.  Approximately 10 minutes to both Kierland Commons, North, and Scottsdale Fashion Square, South.    My specific apartment is on the 2nd (top) floor, and the high ceiling and sky light make the living room fill with natural light.   We pay an average price for the area, 1100/month, and that's after 2 years of raising it.  I have always, always, always felt safe there, which is important for a single woman in her 20's.  There are 3 pools on site too.    As far as office/management, Karen is firm and can come across as harsh, but she is just doing her job.  Maintenance is AMAZING - after several days of my key sticking in the lock I called maintenance and in less than 30 minutes I had someone come up, look at the problem, get a new lock part, and fix it!  Good service, helpful attitude.    Only negatives would be parking on the weekend and that they don't accept UPS packages anymore, so you have to go to the Post Office to get them.  Annoying.  It's also noisy on the occassional Friday or Saturday night - but never bad enough that I couldn't sleep.",1,1
"I don't expect much out of an apartment complex... lets be honest... we all had negative experiences that just make us hope for the essentials and that the staff will somewhat acknowledge your existence past routine notes taped to your door. That was my mentality before I moved into Acacia and I am SO GLAD that I live here!! It is amazing!   Between four years of college and four years of post college, I have lived in approximately 8 apt complexes in 3 states and Acacia Creek is the BEST overall!!! First and foremost, the staff and maintenance are just absolutely outstanding. If you have a request, they will tend to it immediately. They remember your name and call just to touch base and make sure things are okay. They are very respectful of your privacy and the grounds always stay clean and maintained. The complex is fairly quiet... and I don't even see my neighbors very often but it seems like more professional couples, young adults and singles... though there are some families with young children as well. There are 3 pools, and 1 is heated, a decent sized gym and lots of uncovered parking. (and a recycling bin!!!)   The location is great! It's just South of Scottsdale and Shea, on Gold Dust Avenue. Lots of things within walking distance grocery stores (Fresh and Easy, Safeway), bars and restaurants (Baja Bar, Eddies, Chop and Wok, Indulge Burger, Dennys, Oregenos), and two pharmacies. It's about 10 minutes to Old Town and Kierland Commons, approx 5-7 minutes to the 51 and 5-7 minutes to the 101.   The apts are nice. We live in a 2 bdrm/ 2 bath corner unit on the 2nd floor (top floor) with a fireplace and a HUGE patio (approx 7x15!). It has a nice skylight and an entire wall of windows. One design flaw I noticed is that there's only one AC vent in the living room area, while there are 3 in the master bedroom which is half the size. It does take a long time for the living room to cool down on the hot days (esp being a top floor, corner unit with lots of exposure to the afternoon sun). But the walls are 2 toned with a nice beige accent wall in every room, including the bathrooms. The master has a large walk in closet and lots of storage. There is also a full sized washer and dryer. The appliances are older Hotpoints, but they work well so no real complaints outside of aesthetic purposes.   Overall, if you are looking for an affordable option in the heart of Scottsdale, or you are new to the area and want somewhere safe and comfortable... DEFINITELY consider Acacia Creek.. you will not be disappointed!!",1,1
"Definitely high end, high dollar stores! More like a museum than anything else. But it's so beautiful to walk around and do a little window shopping! Stop by Christian Louboutin and admire the red bottoms. Right across the way they have a little wine shop/lounge area to take a load off and enjoy a flight of white or reds or both! I very much enjoyed cruising around the shops.",1,1
"Love walking through here. Pretty views and displays.  And of course, high end stores.  Good restaurants can be found in here too.",1,1
"This was the highlight of my stay in Vegas! I love shopping at high end places, for some reason it makes me really happy spending loads of money.  The mall itself is kind of small, but it is really pretty inside.  Some shops here include Fendi, Barney's New York, Cartier, Ralph Lauren (includes Black Label) and Michael Kors.. Among others!  All the stores are really nice with marble floors and such!  This is the best place to go besides Rodeo Drive and 5th Avenue in New York if you're looking for an upscale shopping experience!",1,1
"This is one of those great Las Vegas places for window shopping and people watching. I haven't bought anything here, but I've spent several hours exploring the shops.  Bauman Rare Books is one of those fantastic stores where you want to walk around with your hands tied behind your back because you don't want to touch anything and leave a print on anything.  What an interesting shop.  I also window shop and the tie shop and I smile when I think that I know longer have to wear a tie unless i want to.    Those are just two of the neat places in the Shoppes at the Palazzo.  I sometimes wonder how some stay in business because they're almost hiding in plain sight, but many people don't know the extent of the shoppes nor the different hallways that take you to different shops on different floors.",1,1
"If you had all the money in the world, this is shopping heaven. I was drooling all over. Christian Loubitin boutique? Barney's New York? ChloÃ©, Diane Von Furstenburg and Jimmy Choo all situated in one place! (They don't have a Chanel boutique but you will find one next door at the Wynn).  Basically, at The Palazzo, many of the stores have special collections you can't find anywhere else which is truly something ...  If you go in December, you will find some awesome deals. The shoes at Barneys were half off, and many of the stores had seasonal pieces at 40% off. If you are looking for high end fashion items, this is the place to go.  I'll def revisit when I come here, even for the sake of window shopping =)",1,1
Definitely an upscale shopping center. The shops/boutiques are definitely for the rich. =)  Great shopping experience.,1,1
"Because it's on the Strip, we don't get down to The Shoppes to often....however, when we make the trip, we're always happy that we did.  There is a nice selection of upscale shops.....Fendi, Billionaire, Burberry, Coach...and many more.  Those are a few of the shoppes The Better Half (TBH) and I like to browse.  While we're here, we always make sure to stop by the Double Helix Wine Bar to enjoy a glass of Wine while we're shopping.  Located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, it's away from the action of the Casino.  There's a good selection of restaurants on the 2nd floor as well.  Will I return?  You can count on it.",1,1
"I love the shops....perfect for window shopping, because most of the time I can't afford anything. Its usually never crowded, well whenever I've been there.   Once you walk into one of the stores you get greeted by wonderful sales people. They make you feel so welcome. Walk into one of the stores, look around and sip on champagne. I utterly love that.",1,1
High end stores; very nice area to walk around if you want to window shop or get out of the Vegas heat.,1,1
"The Shoppes at the Palazzo is one of the finest collections of luxury brands you will find one the strip.  The mix what you need and what you want is dangerous because you can spend a lot of time and money over there and that's exactly what they are going for.  Nestled above the Palazzo Casino floor it feels much more welcoming than the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian although you can't discount the difference in atmosphere being a good change of pace.  The Shoppes at the Palazzo is more of your ""traditional"" shopping setting.  This is a great place to go for shopping, dinning and just strolling around.  If you haven't stopped by I would make it a point to go.",1,1
"Smashed burgers done properly in the heart of Weston village. Very happy that we have a spot like this now in the area. All the right elements that make a great diner style smashed burger ( freshly ground steak on site, no fillers, execellent layer of crust on the patty, can't forgot to mention house cut fries ) . I opted for the signature z- burger ( double cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion strings,z-sauce)with an order of Greek fries( Caramelized feta,evoo, and what I think was tzatiki sauce, awesome) , my partner went for the sorry eh burger( bacon cheese burger, fried egg, tomato, onion string and z-sauce) with a classic poutine done right.  Definitely worth trying this place .",1,1
"The burgers here are the best burgers I have ever had, to top it off the service is even better. I was in the car waiting and the cook brought us the food when he didn't have to. Overall I will be coming here again!",1,1
"Great fresh burgers seared on a flat-top, and excellent fresh-cut fries and poutines, served up by an owner who cares.  Freshly-ground daily, a 4oz. scoop of AAA beef is dropped on the flat top then smashed flat and seared until it's nicely crusted, then served on a sesame seed bun.   The beef is juicy and flavourful, but not dripping with grease, like some places. Mark the owner tells me that he purposely set out to make decadent angus burgers, trying to keep it healthy, without sacrificing flavour.  Their poutine is huge, featuring thinner fresh cut potatoes, double-fried and topped with legit fresh white cheese curds and delicious beefy gravy.    *Don't forget to check-in to take advantage of the 15% discount special.  In a city where gourmet burger places are popping up every day, this is one of the good ones. Definitely check it out and help keep this place alive, we need to keep joints like this around and successful.",1,1
"Finally checked out this place yesterday after hearing great reviews about it... and it did not disappoint! My husband had the Z burger, I had the Heat burger and we shared the chef's poutine. Everything was amazing!!! Patty was very fresh and cooked to perfection and the toppings just topped it all off! The owner and his father were both so fantastic and went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying everything! The place is very clean and lots of room for seating. The mama in me also noticed a high chair which is very convenient for families with babies/toddlers :) Definitely check this place out! Nice to see some good spots being put in Weston... will definitely be back soon!!!",1,1
Excellent and friendly service and even better burgers! Tried the Z-burger and it well surpassed my expectations. Highly recommend Zeal Burger.,1,1
"Really good burger and fries. Always fresh, you can tsste the quality of the ingredients. Reasonably priced for what you get. Will be a regular customer.",1,1
"Love this place! Got their Signature burger, The Z Burger but the mini one! Their Z sauce is like a Big Mac sauce but way better!! I wish I lived right next to this place. Can't wait to try the Dunamis burger next!",1,1
"Had a Z burger with a fried egg and guac, one of the best burgers I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. The smell of those burgers on the flat top would make a vegetarian reconsider their dietary choices. I'm ecstatic that they opened a legit burger joint in the Weston and Lawrence area. I love the area, grew up there, so any new business, especially one of Zeal Burger's quality, is a welcome addition to the 'hood. Thumbs way up guys keep it up! You deserve every star. Believe the hype.",1,1
"Just had the zburger and poutine, if you want want a real filling homemade touch than this is the place. I definitely have a new hamburger stop, maybe I can can get a job there just to eat the food!!?  Cheers!",1,1
"This was an amazing experience. The server/cook is such a friendly and caring host. He consistently makes sure that his customers are enjoying the food. He also makes sure the food is nice a presentable and treats every order and burger with perfection. I've tried The Heat and it's a pretty solid burger. It's a nice mix of ingredients. The fries were also pretty good. The area is spacious, clean and well maintained.   I've never met someone who is so dedicated to perfection when it comes to serving food. I will most definitely be returning.",1,1
The dude here is the nicest guy. Knew everything about the food and made us feel welcome. Burgers were amazing and worth the extra money. Skip Harvey's for this.,1,1
"Tastiest burger I've ever had! I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed:)",1,1
"Honestly the best burger joint I've ever been too, hands down! I came here a couple months ago for the first time. I ordered the Sorry Eh burger and told them I prefer no egg and they were more then glad to leave it out. The feta poutine was amazing as was the Nutella milkshake! Very friendly owner and the other guy was as well! Keep up the good work and wish you all the best in the future!",1,1
This is by far one of the best burgers in the city.  I live in the area and been meaning to try these guys for a while now.  Finally went into grab their Zeal burger with bacon and cheese.  OMG!!!! This burger was juicy with tons of flavour and cooked to perfection.  That was yesterday and I went back in for another one today -had to it was too good.  Might even go back tomorrow for another!!! Very clean place and great service!! Highly recommend to any burger lover.   PS Ate it too fast to take any pics to post.,1,1
"I read all the reviews and decided to give this place a try. Absolutely the best hamburger I've had in a long long time. Love the fries and the feta, the beef is grilled with a nice crust. Very friendly guy behind the counter, he walked us through the menu and made some recommendations. I am so happy that this place is so close to home.",1,1
"Just had my first ever Zeal burger - I never did a review before but I felt like I had too here!  From the second I walked in with my guests, we were greeted with a great friendly smile!!!  The burgers were cooked in front of us and looked soooooo good!!!!  The fries are cooked to perfection and the burger is definitely memorable!!!!  100% recommendation!!!!!",1,1
This had to be one of the best burgers I've eaten in a long time! Everything was fresh and very tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I would definitely recommend this place to people.,1,1
"First time here since the Sang's Chinese restaurant at this location closed. Nice 50's decor in Coca-Cola red, white and black. Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which ""chips"" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he's trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don't like Nutella. Apparently they had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake yesterday but were sold out of it. I gotta try that!",1,1
"Burger patty is ground from AAA meat and made daily you can tell from the taste that it is fresh. Fries are not greasy. Burger was done right not overly seasoned or drowning in toppings. I can tell the cook/owner loves what he's doing as you can see and taste it in the food. Customer service was top notch, place is very clean. I live in Markham and will drive to this place again probably next weekend!!",1,1
"Wonderful service with a smile. The owner does everything himself (two thumbs up). One of the best best burgers in the city for sure. I wish they were open later though, just a thought.",1,1
"Excellent - so happy I discovered Zeal Burgers.  Much better than 5 guys or other places (and much more inexpensive - everything is included in combo!).  Meat is superb, bun is the freshest and fries are homemade, non-greasy.   The eating area is also extremely clean and cheerful. I don't live in the area, happened to discover it when I was visiting a friend but will certainly be travelling here all the time - certainly worth it.",1,1
"Fantastic burger! Definitely on par with five guys and I would say it's even better. The z burger had delicious onion straws and all the ingredients were fresh. The texture of the patties were unlike any place I've ever been to, a must try!  Also worth a mention, the fries are very tasty (not greasy like most places). I didn't get a chance to try the Z poutine but it sounds like perfection.",1,1
"So I was randomly in the area, I had some time to kill waiting for someone so Zeal  Burgers was in area,  claiming they were great gourment burger and after having the Z Burger I cant say I disagree  The Z burger was a double cheese burger, two fresh grilled 4 oz patties, topped with their onion ""stringer"" Which is their take on mix between fried onion and onion rings, so it still is deep fried but not as large as onion rings, which is tasty add with their z sauce it was an amazing burger",1,1
"Ordered the ""Sorry, Eh"" burger with fries and it was a really solid burger. It was cooked perfectly with a nice fried eggs and their signature Z sauce is a much improved version of the Big Mac sauce. Their fries were a little bit bland, but still acceptable. Although a bit pricy ($10-15 usd) I would highly recommend this place.",1,1
"Loved these burgers!  Fresh ingredients, flavours mesh perfectly for a mouthwatering experience.  My kids loved the fries and their cheeseburger. My husband devoured the spicy burger even though he ""wasn't hungry"" and I loved my feta.  We will go back often.  The owner is a great guy, made us feel really welcome as we had just moved to the city.",1,1
"Good food, good people, good prices. About 14$ for double patty and a couple extras and fries   The parking is a bit tricky if you don't wanna pay since the location is located on a main street",1,1
"My go to place to study!  They play great music at a volume where you can still hear yourself think.  It's almost never crowded, and the people that come there generally are reading or studying.  They have an amazing tea collection, with equally good food and even grilled cheese sandwiches (with the option to add tomato :) )  One of the walls has some cute benches that are padded, making it a perfect place to wrap your hands around your warm cup of tea and read a book.  I agree with Rachel C, I wish they had high tea, that would make it perfect!  The only drawback is that it's small, and there aren't a lot of places to sit.  If you are the mood to try a variety of tea, or just need a place to study/relax this is it!",1,1
"This place is ridiculously cute, colorful, and cozy, with a huge selection of loose leaf teas.  They offer teas by the pot only, except for iced teas (during warm months) which come by the cup.  They range from $3 to $4 per pot depending on how fancy the tea is.  The staff here has been friendly every time I've been.  They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask!  Last time, I was struggling between going for a fruity tea vs. a chocolatey tea, and the girl working suggested this chocolate peppermint tea blend that was not on the menu but that she had made for herself the other day.  I tried it, and it was AMAZING!  My experiences with the food here (from at least a year ago) have been great as well.  They have their own pastries as well as a selection from a nearby bakery.  Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.  One small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.  You can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing.  Newspapers and reading materials are usually available to pick up, and there are board games in the back.  This is a great place for a rainy (or cold) day!",1,1
"You can purchase from a huge variety of loose leaf teas. It's one of the few places I know that really pays attention to brew times and water temperature. The smoothies are fresh and taste very natural. If you order in, they'll give you your drink in a cup that looks smaller than if you order to-go. They have nice metal counters with lots of plug in places for your laptop. The benches aren't terribly comfortable, but the couches are. Plus, the people behind the counter are great!",1,1
"I dropped by Te Cafe a week ago with CM to check out their offerings. As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so.  When we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price.  While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free.  We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant.  Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well.  My favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table.  Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time!  We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won.  Yay!  While I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!",1,1
"Came on a weekday afternoon to study and it was a good environment to do so. I got salmon sushi for a great price, and the pots of tea with free refills are a great deal too. The employees are friendly and attentive. This place seemed like a nice casual place to spend a few hours studying, and I'd definitely recommend it to others.",1,1
Amazing people  Loveeee the owners. Best sushi in town best service and nothing beats their prices  Good for bubble tea lovers,1,1
"This place hasn't changed a bit. Still awesome tea, great service and friendly faces. Although, the owners have changed, Te Cafe remains the same.   So good to be back and sipping on my favorite iced lavender lemonade.",1,1
Mulled Apple Cider Tea. Deliciousness in a hot steaming cup.  Lots of space to lounge in. Friendly service.,1,1
First visit here the other evening and it turned out to be the perfect place to sit and relax after a long busy day at work.  I didn't even look over  the tea selections because this cafÃ© had me the minute I saw the featured drink listed on their outdoor sidewalk sign.  I thoroughly enjoyed sipping  my  hot cider tea drink on  the cozy corner seat near the window while reading and watching the world pass by.  Truly a good place to unwind and be refreshed.,1,1
"LOVED THIS PLACE.  It's like a coffee shop (/it is a coffee shop ha), but also has sushi. Good vibe and fairly quiet, which I always appreciate. There were about 5 other people working in here when my friend and I stopped in for lunch - and it's sad that this is rare - but everyone respected the fact that everyone else was working and stayed reasonably quiet.  The sushi rolls were good and priced well for sushi. They were a good size too, which meant I ate just the right amount of food for lunch by ordering one roll with a seaweed salad.  The best part for me was by far the service. Very friendly throughout my whole experience. As my friend and I were leaving, the people behind the counter even asked us if needed anything else. We said we were all good and they sent us off with a ""have a good day"" and a smile.",1,1
"Te Cafe has an extensive selection of teas including dozens of green and black teas as well as a few other variations; you can also order coffee, hot chocolate, and pastries. In terms of ambiance, it is one of the coziest establishments that I have been in making it an ideal place to read, study, or complete some work. It's also a nice venue to meet up with a friend for a pot of tea and some quiet conversation. There are also some board games (including Chess, Backgammon, and Dominoes among several others)",1,1
"I came here with a friend and her young child for my first visit.  What a nice and friendly place!  The staff was super sweet and helpful and suggested some different teas for my friend.  I ended up getting a white tea which was nice.    The cafe has both tables and comfortable side seating (long comfy bench).  I believe they also have a couple of comfy chairs.  In addition to the internet, they have made this a cozy place with games that customers can play with - both for adults and children!  My friend's child ahd the time of his life.    I'll definitely be going back!",1,1
"Went here with my girlfriend and really enjoyed this place. Great atmosphere. I'm not that into tea, but I had a couple cups from the pot my gf ordered and enjoyed it. We ordered 2 biscotti, a medium coffee and a pot of tea (which comes with a free refill) and it cost just over $7. The Barista was really nice and helpful.",1,1
"This is a cute little shop that you might miss if you're not paying attention. The person behind the counter was very helpful and the tea I ended up getting was very delicius. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, it's worth stopping in.",1,1
"Good tea, comfy chairs.  I hear the food is also good, but have not tried it.  Nice quiet place to relax.",1,1
"With wireless internet and a relaxing ambience, this was a place I was looking for during my two years in grad school.  Coffeehouses in Pittsburgh often were too loud and rickety uncomfortable chairs.  The owners are often attentive and bring a certain unique warmth to the place.  Sure, a large part of the cafe is devoted to them.  I loved coming here for an after-dinner conversation with a friend or for studying.  Normally I would order a pot of darjeeling or a green tea.  Great selection of teas.  Very attentive service.  They give you a timer to help you remember how long to steep the tea.  The cups are all selected for the particular type of tea being served.  When I was in the area, the cafe closed on Saturdays (being in Squirrel Hill), but I hear the hours may have changed.  Also, the owners seemed to have hired some of the younger crowd in the last few months which changed the pace somewhat.  Still, when I visit Pittsburgh, I will return to this place.",1,1
"I'm writing from Te Cafe right now.  I love this place and always made an effort to come here when I was visiting Pittsburgh from other locales.  It's sad that I don't come out here more often, now that I live here again...  Anyway, they have a fantastic beverage selection (not just tea), high-quality loose-leaf teas you can buy by the ounce, comfortable enough seating, free wifi, and friendly staff.  The music's a toss-up; right now, it's some pretty good oldish rock, but apparently there is ""wispy Lillith fair crap,"" sometimes?  On the bright side, if you show up on a bad day, it is definitely quiet enough to allow you to just listen to your own on headphones.  And the clientele is pretty varied, which I also rather like.",1,1
"Stopped by Te when I was in Pittsburgh and loved it.  Quaint little place in Squirrel Hill with a fantastic selection of loose teas.  The staff knows their teas and is friendly/helpful.  And the atmosphere is comfortable and neighborly.  If you're new to tea, this is a great place to get started and learn more.  And if you're a tea veteran, you'll be happy with the variety.  Cream Earl Grey is delicious, as well as peppermint rose.",1,1
"Te Cafe is going to be one of my favorite places in Squirrel Hill.  I feel it.  So here is the quick summary: -  Loose leaf teas served by the cup or pot at reasonable prices!  Cups of tea were around $2, and I got a pot of peaches and cream tea for $4.01 with tax.  The Cream Earl Grey is amazing as well!  There is also free hot water so you can keep going!  - If you are not a hot tea drinker, there is also iced tea, lemonade, and hot chocolate!  -They sell grilled cheese sandwiches with pesto for $4.50 ish.  I don't remember the exact price, but I remember that the pesto grilled cheese was amazing.  -This place gets packed with wifi hogs.  You've been warned.  I really like the vibe of this place.  It's a good place to catch up with a friend or study, and I like that it's on the quiet side of things.  They usually are out of most of the teas on the menu, but there are still at least 50 types.  I will definitely be returning here soon!",1,1
"Not as fancy as Dobra Tea across the street but it's a comfortable place to meet people work, study, read comma or relax. They have a great selection of Teas and coffee the staff is personable and if asked will give her a recommendation without a lecture about tea.",1,1
"Love how they serve their tea if you get a pot of tea. It's also a great study spot, especially since you can get sushi for lunch here. I usually get the spicy tuna roll, and it's a pretty large portion size. There are plenty of plugs and the wifi is usually pretty good too.",1,1
"Huge fan of Te!  Always a great experience every time I come.  The atmosphere is cozy, nice friendly staff who all know what they are talking about.  Not sure what to order? they will for sure help you out!  I'm a fan of Dragon Pearl Jasmine...yum!  Great place to read a book, do some work, or just hang out with friends.    They have awesome fruit smoothies, made with REAL fruit!  I've gotten them for breakfast a few times, also NYC famous H&H bagels, you cant go wrong grabbing something on the go here.  I get some tea to take home from time to time, there are tons to pick from its hard to choose!  Their daily teas are always changing and are a great way to try something you may not think you would have chosen yourself.  All in all I think Te is great, I don't how they do it but they do it well.",1,1
"Certainly up there as one of my favorite spots in town to study.  The overall ambiance is very conducive to being productive: comfortable chairs, good lighting, a great selection of music at the appropriate volume, and of course the warm tasty beverages that are an absolute steal.  This place has the most robust hot chocolate lineup I have ever seen, with the Mexican chocolate being my favorite.  Free wi-fi, with no necessary password, makes things all the more convenient.  I also love how this place caters to those who want to study/read.  Sure light conversation does occur, but I hope it stays that way such not to detract from the great study vibe this place engenders.",1,1
"Amazing place to read or just relax, lots of loose leaf teas to choose from. Some of their lower priced teas aren't thrilling (especially the greens) but you get what you pay for.   The only problem I see arising is, if you buy a pot which is the best deal, you get a neat tray that comes with a timer, a cup for drinking, and a cup to hold the used leaves. If you're drinking on your own or with a single friend, that's fine and dandy- but it's near impossible to have a proper meeting with three or more people without forcing everyone to use inefficient mugs instead. I might be mistaken but they really should have party tray type tea sets.   Still, 5 stars for sure. Excellent service, eclectic music (classical one day, indie the next), good ambiance, good price, decent hours (I wish they would open a bit earlier, but they close so late that it makes up for it), and some really amazing teas mixed in. Free wifi makes it even better.",1,1
"I'm a graduate student here in Pittsburgh, and this is one of two main places I go when I want to get work done. The tea selection is excellent, and the staff was excellent - everyone knows the teas very well.",1,1
"I only wish they offered sugar. However, good atmosphere. If you wanted to have a decent conversation with a friend of interest, this place is currently ideal. The Chai is amazing.",1,1
"A neighborhood gem.  Don't come here looking for lattes or other fancy coffee drinks, though - it's a TEA shop.  The sushi is pretty good by Pittsburgh standards (no offense, Pittsburgh, but sushi ain't your strong suit).  It's bright and sunny, which is a huge plus, but that means it can get a little warm; layer appropriately.",1,1
I love Te Cafe. I buy loose leaf tea here and also like to come in and occasionally drink a pot with a friend or my fiance. The atmosphere is great. I love it here.,1,1
"I have trouble ordering tea when I'm out because it's such a simple thing to make. I know there are a lot of nuances to the preparation, like everything else, that can give you a plethora of subtle variation that you wouldn't get if it was made incorrectly. However, I still can't stand paying for it.  However, Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it. It's the kind of stuff that, unless you were a tea connoisseur, you would never be tasting. Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane, to Japanese, to just plain odd. I've been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the ""Kokeicha"". It's a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes. I tried to order a tea by the name of ""gunpowder"" but they were sadly out of it. The man behind the counter informed me that the ""Kokeicha"" was very similar.  The tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own. Who would honestly buy 23 dollars worth of loose leaf tea that they've never tried? I'll leave it to the Te Cafe to let me sample them a pot at a time.  Every time I enter the cafe the staff are friendly, accommodating, and most of all informative. They know their way around tea so someone who is completely ignorant, as I am, can get a little guidance. It's a fun place to relax and enjoy a beverage you usually wouldn't; how often do you drink gunpowder at home?",1,1
"Great selection of fairly-priced teas. Good food, too. Could be bigger, but never had a problem finding a comfortable seat. Not much to say, check it out!",1,1
"This is my favorite cafe in Pittsburgh.  The ambiance is nice, somewhat modern and chill, but still comfortable.  There are board games available for playing, but most people seem to either be there with one or two other people to chat, or on their laptops making use of the wi-fi. The staff is very knowledgeable about different kinds of tea, and if you need help picking something, will ask you questions to figure something out - green or oolong?  floral or fruity? - and then bring out several teas for you to smell before choosing one.  My favorite so far is the silk oolong, which is a smooth and slightly creamy oolong tea.  I also really like the tea cups they use for Chinese teas.",1,1
"Te Cafe is one of my favorite spots in Sq. Hill! In the winter, the windows are usually nice and foggy, providing the coziest feel when you're settling in with a hot cup of tea. They also have a nice selection of pastries and sushi, so you can snack or have a tasty meal while you're there to compliment your drink. Their chai tea latte is deeeeelicious as well, highly recommended! Great prices, great service, great food & drink :)",1,1
"Really delicious tea and a good atmosphere. Everyone who works here are nice and helpful. I never feel rushed when I work on my computer. The owners are also great, and bring a nice sense of community to Squirrel Hill when you walk in.   I tried the Sushi here for the first time, and was surprised that they made it on site. You get a lot for $8-$9, and it tastes yummy. Would recommend.   The mulled tea is my favorite though. I'll miss it in the summer.",1,1
"Good selection of tea, plentiful seating, nice atmosphere. I had an iced hibiscus tea that was pretty great. I will definitely be returning.  Also, they have outdoor seating (though it's on the Murray Ave sidewalk and a little noisy) and a clean bathroom.",1,1
The best hidden gem sushi in pittsburgh! Great tea selection also.. highly recommend for delicious inexpensive delivery sushi,1,1
"Perhaps one of the best tea/cafe experiences in Pittsburgh. Hands down, this place is off the charts. The ambiance, employees, and tea are the best in Pittsburgh. Their selection of tea is impressively large. The cafe is also a great place to study.",1,1
"I can't think of a better to way to spend a lazy sunday afternoon than a pot of oolong, a copy of the sunday times, and just sitting back and relaxing at the Te Cafe.",1,1
I've come here twice and have to say their tea selection is fantastic. There are so many different kinds of teas and I appreciate the variety they offer in terms of food + ambiance + teas.   I would give this place 5 stars but I am not a fan of their bubble tea. They microwaved the boba (they pre-make it and then put it in the fridge) and the flavor didn't even taste like tea. It was $4 and I don't feel like it was worth it. I was hoping it would be better since they do specialize in tea but I do realize that doesn't necessarily mean their bubble tea would be good since in my opinion that is a whole different category.  I would come back strictly for their hot teas but definitely not the bubble tea.,1,1
"Every tea and tea-related concoction I have had here has been great. The atmosphere is bright and warm. They must have taken the other poster's music complaint into account, because I have heard a wide variety of great stuff every time I have been in there.  The staff is always super-friendly (without being annoying) and the clientele is usually a good mix of studying students/laptop users and people actually having conversations.  In short, good tea, good tea-related creations, good service, good music, good place to study or have a chat.",1,1
"Even if you're not in the mood for something from Te Cafe's diverse tea selection, there are plenty of other drinks that satisfy: tea lattes, lemonades (both plain and with unusual flavors like ginger, lemonade and hibiscus), hot chocolates and more.  The pleasant staff is knowledgeable about its teas and can offer great recommendations.  The loose leaf tea is also sold, and some of the more unusual tea blends can make neat gifts for people.  The atmosphere is calm enough that I can concentrate if I bring work to do.  It's also really helpful that in terms of food, Te Cafe offers more than sweets--while I loved baked goods, sometimes I need something more than sugar to fuel my noggin.  Grilled cheese sandwiches and vegetable soup are recent additions to the cafe's menu.  While the soup is clearly from the can, it and the grilled cheese are nourishing.  I definitely appreciate not having to pack up all my study materials and leave in search of a decent meal.    I really like the feeling of community that Te Cafe fosters with an area for posters and fliers for upcoming local events and work by local artists on the walls.  The cafe also hosts occasional poetry readings, but unfortunately I've never been able to attend one.",1,1
"This is my favorite place to go in Squirrel Hill. There's so many different drink and tea options, I have to keep going back to try everything! The atmosphere is really nice and chill too- perfect for reading, sketching, studying, etc. I only wish there were more pastry/dessert options, other than just tarts and biscotti. It may actually be a good thing (for my wallet) though... haha.",1,1
"Started going to the Te' when they first opened. The two ladies that run the place are very nice and good to talk to.  The teas are excellent! I have yet to find a better place to get good, loose leaf tea. The presentation is top notch and the variety is excellent.  The atmosphere of this little tea shop cannot be described. I would stop by towards the end of the day to finish up some work. The relaxed setting and fairly quiet place made it easy to focus and get things done.  I don't work in the area anymore, but I'll use any excuse to get back there.  Seriously, it is worth fighting to find a parking spot in Squirrel Hill for this place.",1,1
"They have outlets almost everywhere and the seats are extremely comfortable. I had a Kyoto Cherry Rose tea that was absolutely incredible. The staff really knows their tea, the presentation is wonderful, and the atmosphere is beyond pleasant. They also have a few board and card games. Go for work or a game night with friends!",1,1
"This place is super cute! I went here with my bestie (visiting from CBus) and she said it reminded her of Zen Cha, which I can see. You can order pots of tea, sushi, other drinks and real meals! We got a pot of their Apricot black tea to share. It had enough for about 2 refills and the set it came with was adorable! Taste was rich and fruity and made me want to go back for another flavor!  My friend got their sashimi bowl and it looked awesome! It made a nice, light lunch for her and the price wasn't outrageous. I see that they have crepes too so will definitely have to drag the hubs here to order all new stuff!  They also have some games in the back but I was happy just chatting with my friend in the laid back atmosphere.   Some other reviewers mentioned this but the smell of this place really wasn't appetizing--must be due to the combo of fish + tea? The owners were nice enough but they don't start selling their savory dishes until after a certain time which was not listed on the menus. So don't come here too early on the weekends!",1,1
"Delicious green tea latte and tea mulled apple cider. Cozy atmosphere, generally quiet, would recommend for reading or studying and enjoying good tea.",1,1
"I can't believe all this time I did not write a review for TÃ© Cafe. Since I came to Pittsburgh 4 years ago, this place has been my favorite location for some serious work. Hmmm, maybe I didn't write the review because subconsciously I wanted to keep this little gem all to myself.   They have an extended selection of teas though I usually just go for the easy option: the tea of the day. I've gotten their yerba mate every once in a while and I like that they tell you to properly time it at 5 minutes. Nowadays they make smoothies too though I personally haven't tried them (it's nice and quiet without the constant blender buzz). For snacks you can go with the grilled cheese sandwiches or some of the regular coffe shop sweets. Sometimes I complain about the lack of options in the snack department but I have to admit it seems wise to keep the food choices simple, after all you have more than 50 teas to chose from.  If you're looking for a mellow place to work (with comfy chairs) and few people mostly working at their computers or reading their ipads this is the place for you.   Side warning:  I love the comfy chair and I'll give you mean stares if you happen to occupy it :)",1,1
"I love this place, it's become my go-to take out sushi place. The owners are very friendly people, the atmosphere is charming and quiet, the tea is very delicious and varied, and the sushi is excellent at a cheap price. I come here at least once a week now.",1,1
"I love buying a pot of tea and studying here. It's always quiet, there's a ton of outlets, and you can always get free refills of hot water. It has a great, relaxing environment. Their lavender lemonade is great as is their plum berry white tea. I wish they had more room. The one thing they can definitely improve upon is their bathroom. The toilet is almost always broken and it never seems too clean.",1,1
"Not a tea drinker myself, but I stumble in here about three or four times a year to buy tea for my mom for various gifts. Every time I've been in, the staff's  been great with suggestions, samples, patience, etc. Went in again yesterday, and again...totally great. For being a clueless meathead, I was treated with no condescension, just the barista's enthusiasm for tea.    One of the good businesses in Squirrel Hill I'm happy to support.",1,1
"I recently  moved away from Pittsburgh, but this is one of the spots I miss the most. I spent many hours here working on my thesis, but also many hours here just hanging out with friends or reading a book. The people who work there are very friendly and very patient. When I first started stopping in, I knew very little about tea, and they always took the time to explain different properties of each type of tea and were able to make thoughtful suggestions for things they thought I should try based on my current mood and goals for the day.  One of the best parts of this place is the insane selection they have. I felt like there was always something new to try. I loved the hot cider in the winter.  The space was almost always neat and clean, including the bathroom. I enjoyed the little flowers they kept on the tables, and the music selection was what you would hope for in a cozy little tea shop. The atmosphere is inviting, and only rarely would it be too crowded to find a place to sit. The wi-fi was much more reliable than other places in the area.  I love this place! If I ever make it back to Pittsburgh, I'm going to make it a point to stop in. Keep up the great work!",1,1
"This is my favorite cafe in Pittsburgh. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, I prefer drinking tea or smoothies if I'm sitting at a cafe and Te Cafe is perfect for that. It's a very chilled out place, got big windows and all kinds of seating. It's not the fanciest cafe around, which is actually nice, because it has a very comfortable vibe to it. They have free and unlimited wifi. The ambience is great for doing your own thing, but I've also played board games there.  They have all kinds of teas there. They have specials every day in each variety, and they give you a pot of it, which is around 2-3 cups. You can also order a pot of any loose leaf tea on the menu. Or, you can buy loose leaf tea as well. My all-time favorite is the Panetonne. It's a black tea with vanilla and orange, and just the right amount of it too. I also really like their Green Tea smoothie, they make it with Maccha powder. They make grilled cheese sandwiches and have some biscottis and muffins.  Great place, check it out!",1,1
"That's my second time here, and I'm so happy that i've discovered that place! Very comfortable and relaxing atmoshere, delicious teas and huge variet varieties them! Friendly, always kind and heping stuff! That's one if my favorite places now!!!!",1,1
"Aw, I love it. It looks like a really great study area. I would come here to study. Also they give you a pot of tea with free hot water refills. That would be perfect for studying. Also, the guy working there was really helpful with suggestions. And the place inside is just super chill.",1,1
Can't vouch for the sushi as I only stopped by for a lunch time snack.  Tried the sandwich of the day which was a grilled cheese pannini and I have the iced chai latte.  Both were tasty and reasonably priced.  Staff was friendly and place was clean and comfortable.  If I was living in this area I could see myself coming in here on a pretty regular basis.,1,1
"With a calm, peaceful atmosphere, a very friendly and knowledgeable staff, and a wide selection of great quality products, I would definitely recommend this place.  Both the iced chai tea latte and the sparkling tea were excellent, and I'm sure that their other stuff is great too. I'm definitely going to have to make a point of coming back.",1,1
This is my 9 year olds review.     Hamburgers are great and the cheese curds are awesome.   There is a Great Lake View,1,1
Great scenery. Solid food. Great energy! A must in the summer!!,1,1
"Great volleyball courts! The sand is soft but at night, some of the lights will shine right in your face and obstruct your view while you're playing.  There is a hose and area to rinse off afterwards, by the dock facing the beautiful, glistening Lake Waubesa.  A cherry bomb will run you $7 and a Vodka 7 will run you about $5 or so.  Be careful when you order the pizza, you start with either a 12"" ($8.99) or 16"" ($10.99) cheese and each topping is $1.50! My friends and I weren't aware of that and got a little carried away when we got our tab for all the drinks, pizza and wings was just under $100!  On Monday nights they have a AYCE taco bar with ground beed and chicken, as well as assorted toppings. The pico de gallo was very fresh, the shredded romaine was crisp, and the salsa had a nice bite to it. Every time you were ready for more, just ask the nice bartender to give you more shells (corn hard shell or soft flour tortillas).",1,1
"Great food, great environment, low key, full bar plus a tiki bar in the summer! Best nachos I've ever had in my life. Seriously. Overall just a chill, consistently great place that in the summer is the place to be if you like the sun lake and boating. Been looking for a place like this",1,1
"Good food, drinks, and views.  Great place to come by boat in the summer!",1,1
"I'm very surprised to read all the negative reviews. We were made to feel very welcome as soon as we sat at the bar by Tim the bartender. He was unfailingly polite and friendly, as were the people who sat near us. It made me wish we had more time to hang out and soak up the lovely waterfront location.   Starving, we ordered a pizza and both enjoyed enjoyed the hell out of it. The toppings tasted very fresh and the crust had a slight flakiness to it. The only drawbacks I can think of are the plastic cups the beer is served in and that I'd love it if another taphandle were devoted to something a bit more local to Madison, like Ale Asylum, Karben4, or even Tyranena (from Lake Mills).  As we left Tim thanked us for stopping in and asked us to come back the next time we were nearby. I 100% plan to do so.",1,1
"A great neighborhood hangout with good food and great beer.  This is THE place to be on a summer night, and usually something fun happening on the ice in the winter.  The place is loaded with character(s) and is a true Wisconsin tavern on the lake.",1,1
"Today I had another session with Les.  I was having so much pain in my foot I thought I was going to have to give up dance.  Les did a combination of multiple modalities on me including lymphatic drainage, chiropractic massage, Russian massage to realign my leg and foot.  I was very relaxed and even when he had to use more pressure on the reflexology, it was fine.  He diagnosed that I had a tight inner thigh muscle and he got it to release.  Les is so experienced and can read your body and diagnose where your physical issues are.  I am telling all my friends about his work!",1,1
"Les is just incredible!!  I participate in a number of sports and work my muscles to the max.  A typical week includes 6 hours of high-intensity interval training as well as three to four 3-6 mile runs.  As a public speaker, I spend 8-hours per day standing on high heels.  Massage is not a ""luxury"" for me nor is it about relaxation - it is about allowing me to continue to do the things I love without pain.  Until I began going to Advanced Body Therapy, I did not think that was possible.  Les is fantastic in the office and encourages me to continue my active lifestyle by even showing me stretches I can do at home.",1,1
Les is the Masseuse Master. Had a Deep Tissue massage this morning and it was great!,1,1
Again.... Les has worked his magic on me.  Just 1 visit & already I have less pain & more mobility in my injured knee.,1,1
"A really good sandwich place. It's location is a little unusual but very convenient to the surrounding airport hotels. The turkey, avocado bot was great.",1,1
The food was definitely solid but what stood out the most for me was the friendly staff and the iced coffee they whipped up. Wish I had got their largest size. Highly recommended!,1,1
Great place to grab lunch. The location is a little hidden. It's in an office building. There is shaded outside seating. The food was fresh and my sandwich tasted great. My only complaint was that the potato salad had too much dill in it.,1,1
"What a find, right behind the Radisson, fresh cheap and delicious.  Friendly staff. Give it a try.",1,1
"I work in a office building right around the corner from them.  The place is small, but once you find it, you'll keep coming back.  Honest to God, the food is addictive.  My faves are the Italian Hoagie (reminds me of home back East) and the Chipotle Chicken sandwich.  And I also enjoy their flavored iced tea to go along with it.  Staff is friendly too which makes the experience even better!  I'm a fan!",1,1
"Only open for lunch spot, a nice little sandwich shop hidden behind the Radisson. I had the Grilled Fiesta Chicken Wrap and really enjoyed it. Pretty large sandwiches from what I can tell and looking forward to trying other options, as well. Being from out of town, you can tell it has its regulars and people really like this lunch place.",1,1
"After arriving at PHX airport we searched for a nearby lunch option and this was well reviewed.  It was a little difficult to find.  It's hidden in a larger building with very little signage.  Also the parking lot has signs about hotel guests only etc.. so that was a little unnerving.  They were closing soon when we came in, but we ordered a BLT and a southwest chicken panini.  Both were ready quickly and were very good.",1,1
"Happy to have found this place! Great food, decent prices, friendly staff. This makes me a more-than-once-a-week patron! And they will even accomodate an off-menu request as long as they have the ingredients. Thanks, Fred!",1,1
"I absolutely love this place! In fact, probably my favorite sandwich spot. A hidden gem. I eat here atlas once a week. I have yet to have one bad thing.  My favorite sandwiches are the Queen of Clubs ( like the King of clubs, but with only a double decker not a triple decker) and the tuna melt. The cobb and garden of eden salad are my favorites. Their sandwiches and salads are pretty big, so go with an appetite. Its a mom and pop sandwich shop, which I love. Try it out! You will not be disappointed!",1,1
"Tucked in behind the Radisson at the corner of an office park, this is a great alternative to the food in the local hotels.  I had the Cobb salad. Despite the generic iceberg lettuce it was enhanced with fresh spinach, avocado and egg and everything else was fresh. Good dressing and generous portions.  As others have said come before noon or after 1 o'clock if you don't want to wait in line. Three nice tables outside with a little lawn view.",1,1
"an excellent place for lunch, the food is great the service too! always friendly, never pushy, as one guy said, i like the 'tude of the lounge lady...i call it the the lunch lizard and its off the beaten path but you wont go wrong with thier specials or anything on the menu for that matter. the outside seating is nice, i try to eat here regularly...beats any chain sammich shop!",1,1
"i am not a fan of turkey so when i asked the sandwich guy for his recommendation, and he suggested the albuquerque turkey, i was unsure, nevetheless i went on to try it and boy! Was i glad? The sandwich comes with   fresh cole slawish salad, bacon cooked just right crisp and retaining its flavor, generous slice of turkey and to top it off chile mayo which is really what separates  this sandwich from the other diners... .all in all a great sandwich...made to perfection. I want to come here and try other items on the menu... They all look good....hopefully on my next trip to phoenix.",1,1
"Great service in a quick-bite-to-eat, make-your-own-sandwich spot. Most of the business probably wanders from those office buildings. People looked lost and in their own heads as they would methodically make their way. It is a sunny day at 74Â° but it's clear that's it's Friday at the office. Anyway back to the food- Choices for breads cheese meats veggies Chips and soda  Pretty standard with more selections available too  Sandwich was well prepared and tasted as expected.  Note: Almost gave them four stars because the cashier is a Colts fan but we all make choices and their good service and food shouldn't suffer from his choice to root for the Colts. I joke, I joke. Also, Go Patriots. :)",1,1
"Good food at a small lunch restaurant,  it is a good place to pick up lunch if in the area but it is not a destination lunch spot. More of a business man's quick stop.",1,1
I have been to the Lunch Lounge many times for lunch and love the chicken salad.  It is the best!  I also love the BLT's.  Today I stopped in for breakfast and had the breakfast panini sandwich and I am once again impressed.  Thank you Lunch Lounge!!!,1,1
I eat here at least once a week all of their sandwiches and salads are always fresh and delicious and every 9 salads or sandwiches you buy you get the 10th on FREE. Goodstuff! Glad it's near my work.,1,1
"Love this place.  Weekly specials are amazing.  Great, fast, and friendly service.  I'd highly recommend to anyone.",1,1
Today I had the hot pastrami with on the side. The sandwich and the slaw: EXCELLENT!  The staff is great. I'm flying today so I also purchased a pb&j on grain bread for later.   I'm sure it will be awesome too.,1,1
Excellent little hidden spot. Great menu with fair prices. Had the Breakfast burrito with a cup of coffee. Outstanding burrito! Loads of cheese & stuffings. The menu on yelp is a little outdated but the prices are more than reasonable. Definetly give this place a try.,1,1
"Great sandwich shop near several airport hotels. They also serve salads at lunchtime, and breakfast starting at 7:00 AM. Alas, wasn't in town long enough to sample the breakfast, but lunch was fantastic. Small but very popular at lunch when I was there",1,1
Had lunch here. Very close to work but only found out about it through yelp. My sandwich was delicious and the staff was super friendly.  I'll definitely be back.,1,1
"For a little sandwich shop in an office park, this place is great.   Delicious, big breakfast burrito.  No problem to substitute avocado for the meat. Hot tasty coffee. friendly staff. Outdoor seating option.  All for under $6.  So glad I didn't have the more expensive breakfast in my corporate airport hotel.",1,1
"I stumbled upon the Lunch Lounge while staying at the Aloft last week, and was thrilled that I did. It's kind of hidden from the street behind the Radisson on 44th St, but that didn't stop me from taking the short walk over from the hotel. Cute little place with great service and good eats! They have all kinds of sandwiches and salads, and couldn't decide what I wanted since the menu looked so good. They serve Boar's Head meats, which makes for an awesome sandwich. My friends who were staying with me raved about the food and said they wanted to come here for lunch again tomorrow. Only not so great thing was that they were out of the soup of the day, which we wanted to try, but since we did come about a half hour before they closed I could live with that. Wish we had more deli-type places like this in Milwaukee! Yummmmm!",1,1
What a find!  While staying at the Aloft in Phoenix for business we found this on a morning walk.     We had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast panini.  Both were excellent!  The burrito was so large we agreed that it could have fed us both.  The lunch menu looked great and I would like to try some of the sandwiches.  We are here for a few more days and will eat here on Monday.  If you are staying at a hotel in this area be sure to give it a try for a good quick breakfast or lunch.  You won't be disappointed.,1,1
Excellent sandwich luncheon spot!  The Albuquerque Turkey Panini is fantastic!  Green chili mayo?  Who knew?  I had to buy some to go!  Fresh vegetables and Boar's head meat. Warning if you order a cold sub sandwich the bread is a bit too much.  It's loaded with goodies but it's too much bread.,1,1
Great breakfast panini for $5. More affordable than a breakfast or brunch chain for sure. Nothing for breakfast is over $5 which makes this a spot I will recommend and more than likely come back to next trip. Iced coffee is only $1 till 11 and breakfast is served til 11.,1,1
Amazing lunch.  Fresh Boars Head meats. Fresh bread (marble rye is awesome) and tr staff is great.  One of the best sandwiches in the Phoenix area.  Don't miss this place. You won't be disappointed!,1,1
"Worth finding - a little awkward the first time, but I don't regret having to drive the block an extra time! The Italian sub was loaded with meat - just like back home (Boston) - salad was fresh, bread was fresh, meat was just YUMMY!! Nice surprise - we will all be back. BTW - lunch for 4 + drinks was $30.00 ... Great, clean, fresh and friendly!!",1,1
"Restaurant/Ambiance: Small cafe tucked away in a corporate office park. Has a Modern but relaxed cafe vibe inside. Has about 12 or so tables inside with 3 tables outside. Typical clients are business execs and tradespeople on lunch break. No issue getting a table or parking space. Little difficult to find though.  Food: Great selection of sandwiches. Quality meats and fresh veggies. I like the southwest chicken chipotle sandwich. Also excellent salad menu. They also have a great breakfast menu but I've never been there for breakfast.  Service: Fast service, able to move the lunch rush pretty well.  Overall: Great little lunch cafe!",1,1
"SImple to find and great custom made food. Sandwiches, Chips and Drink. No frills but delicious.",1,1
First time for breakfast. Waiting for someone at sky harbor. Breakfast burrito outstanding. A meal in a tortilla. Very tasty and really inexpensive. I'll be back!!,1,1
"Great little local place with tasty food.  Be diligent in finding it as it isn't obvious from the main street.  Minimal seating for eat-in so plan ahead.  Friendly staff, good prices.",1,1
"If you work in the area and have not been here, GO IMMEDIATELY!  I have worked across the street for 15 years and I am so thrilled to finally have good food in the area.  The Chicken Fiesta Wrap is my favorite (I CRAVE it) and the California Club is really good too (crispy bacon....yummmm). If you can get there before they run out of Tortilla Soup it is outstanding. The food is always consistent and they don't seem to cut corners. Reasonably priced for what you get and what's in the area. Fast service, wifi on site, nice staff...I seriously cannot say anything negative.  Thank you for saving our lunch dilemma in the area!",1,1
I picked this spot out because of Yelp. I was looking to walk from my hotel (Aloft) and it's just down the street. Pay attentuon to the signs. It's in the back of a building that blends in with the rest. I had a Cobb salad and it was fresh and ready in about 3 minutes. Seemed like good friendly sevice. Portion was perfect and prices were reasonable.,1,1
Awesome find! Stopped in for breakfast on the run and will probably come back for lunch. The guys are super nice... Coffee is amazing!,1,1
"It is hard to locate but just look for a small sign stating there are just hiding in the back! (: The set up is nice with an option to eat indoors/outdoors although I wouldn't recommend bringing large parties. Customer service was good and the food was delicious! I had to go with the BLT which, they did not shy away with the bacon. I wouldn't mind visiting back for lunch again.",1,1
Great little lunch spot!  Fresh food.  Something for everybody.  Long line at lunch though.  We had our food within 15/20 minutes from the line at the door.,1,1
"Was in Phoenix for business and discovered this friendly, wonderful  haunt  near the airport.  I had the best lunch ever -  a Southwestern chicken chipotle panini.  OMG!  The guy behind the counter turned out to be the owner, and himself grew up in a family owned East coast deli.    I had several expensive meals during my trip, but nothing was as tasty as my Lunch Lounge experience!  I made sure I had time for a breakfast stop on my way back to the airport., and was again wowed with a huge breakfast burrito, great latte and a smile - all for less than my daily NYC latte and muffin.    My  client has never been to The Lunch Lounge, so next time I am in town, we have a lunch date at the best undiscovered charming cafe in Phoenix!  I can't wait to share the secret!",1,1
Tasty and fast.  They primarily serve the corporate crowd so keep that in mind if you visit during prime lunch hours.,1,1
"I stopped in last Friday morning and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast burrito. The service was fast, and not only was the breakfast burrito reasonably priced, but it was also enormous.",1,1
Yum! Good food and they deliver on Amazon Restaurants! I will certainly be ordering again. I was particularly happy with the carb free option for breakfast. We had a happy breakfast crowd.,1,1
Awesome meal.  Very willing to make adjustments and recommendations. Would come back here in a heartbeat.,1,1
"This place is ridiculous! Wasn't expecting much from a deli sandwiched between office buildings, but wow! This place is just across the street from where I work and everyone is blown away by the food. The staff is super friendly and the food is really fresh. The owner took my order a few weeks back and recommended the Stromboli since I always ordered the Roast Beef Press (which is fantastic!). O. M. G... the Stromboli is the best sandwich I've ever had. Inside out sub roll, pesto, ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and cherry peppers - toasted on a panini press. Seriously? On my day off from work, I drove 30 minutes back there to take family there for lunch. If they served dinner, I'd have to think about moving closer.",1,1
"Just paid my first visit to this place and I will definitely be back.  I tried the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and my co-worker had the Hot Roast Beef Press.  Both were good choices, but seeing how happy she was with her choice I have to come back to try that one next.  Plenty of off-street parking.  I only wish this place was open on weekends (although given their location I can understand why they are not).  Maybe open a second location near the business park at University and Elwood (hint, hint)?  I'm pretty sure it would be a big hit.",1,1
"The Lunch Lounge is absolutely delicious and fresh! Everyone is always there with a smile on their faces serving up yummy sandwiches, wraps, and salads. I haven't had one thing on the menu that I have not enjoyed. It is the perfect mom n pop shop of a deli!",1,1
Really good sandwich. I love having my lunch here. I usually buy Veggie Sandwich and I ask them to grill it. Tastes really good and affordable too.,1,1
Hidden cafe with outside seating.    Don't let the name fool you...they also serve breakfast.   Great prices including my 1$ coffee!,1,1
"Needed to find a quick easily accessible place for my kids and myself to eat and this place was in walking distance right behind Radisson hotel where we're staying at. Was able to find something for all of us. Pb&j's for the kids and a hot pastrami for me. Both were delicious and the staff was friendly. Quick, easy and much healthier than the fast food chains. Would of course recommended and return to the lunch lounge. Might actually get me some coffee there tomorrow morning.",1,1
"This place is located in a prime spot for travelers as well as office workers.  The menu is a diverse and creative mix on standard lunch box fare.  Whether it is breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong with trying this place for a simple, but gourmet, breakfast sandwich or a dressed up salad for lunch.  I only gave them four stars for this type of venue because I felt they were a bit understaffed when I arrived around 10am. Don't hold this against them. It was a bit of a wait for a sandwich but the quality is well worth the wait. The dill on the breakfast sandwich was a nice touch.  The outdoor seating was nice on a cool morning.",1,1
"Ashley is a great photographer! She took my maternity photos and newborn photos of my daughter. The pictures came out amazing, she did such a great job. She was so much fun to work with and made you feel comfortable. I would definitely recommend her to anyone needing a photographer and will continue to use her in the future. :)",1,1
"Ashley shot our Christmas card and we had the best time with her, plus she's a complete professional! Our two dogs were there and she was so patient with them and also helpful when trying to get them to look at the camera. She came prepared, had different variations of props to best suit us and was truly a joy to work with. Since our shoot, we eloped and are now married but when we were shooting, I told her we had been engaged in April but never did an engagement shoot. After that, every single shot she took she made an effort to show off my ring! I am looking forward to working with Ashley again for our maternity and future family photo sessions! :) Thanks again for everything, Ashley!",1,1
"Ashley took newborn photos for my daughter. She was so detailed, warm & made it fun. Not to mention the pictures turned out beyond beautiful. I look at them often (years later) and tear up. Ashley really captured those moments you want to remember forever. We will absolutely be using her for future pictures.",1,1
"Great photographer who took beautiful pictures of my grandchildren. Attention to detail is impeccable, customer service is outstanding and the cost is comparable.",1,1
"Much better! I frequent the Charlotte area for work. I previously tried the Golden Crust and honestly I was not impressed. I just went  back this past Saturday not for any cooked food but for prepackaged goods. I shared my dissatisfaction with the manager and she shared things have changed for the better.  A new cook has been hired and she offered samples of oxtail which was tender, well-seasoned and delicious. She also shared a hot flaky fried dumpling, YUM! I'm pleased that the management and cook has changed they are now representing Caribbean food well.",1,1
"What I had was good .. jerk chicken combo with rice and cabbage and gravy on top , and a patty .. very tasty, will stop back 3.6 to 4",1,1
I was SO excited to see Golden Krust outside NY so I had to stop in while in the shopping center.  My curry goat was SO delicious and had all the right flavor and spice.  The flavors reminded me of the great food I used to get when I lived near a Jamaican area in Brooklyn!,1,1
"I've been going to Golden Krust since the franchise came to Charlotte. Food is always great. The prices are reasonable. Service is just OK. On busy nights like Friday and Saturday they have run out of certain items.  I don't know how authentic the food is but it is on par with other Caribbean spots in town. Over all, I do recommend Gold Krust to get your Caribbean fix.",1,1
"Golden Krust is a bakery first and their specialty is the patty, and other baked goods, they also serve Jamaican staples such as oxtails, fish, jerk chicken, and curry chicken with all the fixins(rice and peas, plantains, and veggies), Ting, and other Jamaican drinks. With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive!  Now, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust.......",1,1
"No frills, just good Caribbean curry to go. Goat curry lunch special is under $8.00 with tax. And they have other specials daily while they last. This is a franchise so like all franchises there are certain guarantees in terms of food style and quality and ingredients, but there's also a sense of family here which doesn't exist in all offbeat chain restaurants.",1,1
I am so glad that they got one of these stores here in Charlotte North Carolina I have been trying to find it I found you found Golden Krust Bakery you must eat their the best you're making pulled ever wish they had more big location that is just a little too far for me to get but I get there when I can try it you will love it Golden Krust the best ever,1,1
"If I could give this place 6 stars or more, I DEFINITELY WOULD! I always recommend this place to everyone. Outside of the place doesn't due justice to what deliciousness is served inside!",1,1
"Pretty good Caribbean Food, Nice location, and decent service. They use to be a lot better years ago. It's a little overpriced for the portions you get, but overall it's ok and I'll probably return",1,1
"Golden Krust really does live up to the name. I ordered Jerk Chicken with a shrimp Jamaican patty. The Jamaican patty had such a crispy, well put together crust. It was probably the best Jamaican patty I've ever had. If you're in the Charlotte area & you like Caribbean food, it's definitely a spot to look into.",1,1
"The food here is really good, if you are in the mood for Jamaican food this restaurant is great. The sell cakes and patties which are very good. They get a four star because their portions could be better for the price.",1,1
Delicious food!!! I have been coming to this Caribbean Restaurant since moving to Charlotte 6 years ago. I must admit there was a decline in the food quality about a year ago due to a change in chefs. I did stop coming during that time. I stopped in about a week ago to give it another try. I spoke to the owner and the pleasant staff and found out they have a new chef which they gave rave reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that the were indeed correct. I food was scrumptious  just as I remembered!! Keep up the good work!! I'll be back and I'm putting the word out.,1,1
"FOOD IS GREAT.  The service is average.  The prices are cheap so you tend to get idiots in there who have no manners.  I recommend, taking the food to go or sitting in the back.",1,1
"Tis De Place Mon!  First Off me Being from one of the best cities in the world. NYC i know good west indian food and this hit the nail on the head! Great to the point service, with hardy plates not for the quickly filled stomachs here! Try the cuury goat! and the beef patties!! and a DG Soda!   best in carribean food in charlotte, nc! This is truly the mirror image of true carribeen food! anything else is just a watered down xerox copy.  then even have the spice bread and pastries!  Best for lunch $5-6, and dinner $8-10.",1,1
"Love this place for spicy patties! The patties are worthy of 6 stars, the only reason I gave the 4 stars is because every time I visit the music is blaring and the air conditioning seems to be turned off or not working. They have a dining area, but I can't imagine eating here. And be prepared for a wait, if you have been to the Islands then you know the slower pace you have to get used to.   I have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite. And if you're looking for a cold bottle of Ting or a piece of rock cake, this is your place. Did I mention the spicy patties? Wow, they are delicious. Growing up in Miami, we had a favorite place to go for patties. Here in Charlotte, this is our favorite place. I usually pick up 6, and I'm sure they would hold up fine for a couple of days in the fridge. They never last that long.",1,1
If I could give this place 10 stars I would !!! I loved the food and the service was VERY FAST ! I loved everything and the small plate filled me up I couldn't even finish. The prices are GREAT and it's seasoned so amazing! I felt like I was on the islands. I would go back and take everyone in my family if I could I will definitely be returning my next trip to North Carolina. I loved it !,1,1
Is a small restaurant food is good! Also the owners are very friendly they make sure u are satisfied!,1,1
Best Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Meat is super soft and very tasty. Fried fish is delicious. Salsa is so yummy! Very friendly service.,1,1
"I  would've like to take a before picture when it looked all nice and pretty, but it was so delicious I just couldn't wait. I had the chicken chimichanga and my friend had of the chicken burrito supreme. I will never visit Robertos, Pepe's tacos, etc. again. #obsessed",1,1
"We had originally planned on eating at the Sinaloa food truck across the street, but they had a really long line, so we decided to give Mi Pueblo Taco Shop a try. Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign.   I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.  Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor.   Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred.   Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.",1,1
One of the few times I have given a business five stars. This restaurant has very good food everything on the menu is fresh and very very tasty. I've been to this restaurant probably 10 to 15 times and have never had a bad meal. Is the owner and staff of this restaurant are very nice and courteous and provide a good service and excellent food. I highly recommend this place for anything Mexican on their menu you will not be disappointed.,1,1
"Las Vegas does not have a lot of good Mexican food unfortunately. So, when we do find one, it's always pretty exciting. This place was good. Reminded me a little of Texas, in terms of quality.  Enchilada was very tasty, great sauce. Rice and beans were both delicious. Chile Relleno needed a tiny bit more flavor, but had plenty of cheese. Great little salsa bar. Had a bite of gf's Huevos Rancheros and we agreed that they were pretty awesome. We'll be back soon.",1,1
"Trying to curb my taco cravings, checked yelp for a taco spot not too far from the house, when I came across the review for Mi Pueblo Taco Shop and they have a perfect 5star rating. I haven't got my food yet, but the smell coming out the kitchen is amazing. It's a Friday night in Vegas, at a hole in the wall taco shop. The single file line is out the door.....Now that's a recipe for GREAT Mexican food",1,1
My daughter and I stopped in yesterday and truly enjoyed our meal. So much so we added an order to go. Just might have to give up my usual taco spot!!!! Food was great. My only critic no chips and salsa before the meal and only gives you a couple chips stuck in the great beans!!! Also might look into making up paper menus. Nothing to take home to read. The service impeccable. Will be back for sure.,1,1
"The carnitas sopÃ©s are the best! Carne Asada tacos are in second place...  I eat there at least twice a week, and it's fantastic every time!",1,1
"Talk about authentic Mexican food!! there i was in search of a new place to eat close to work. I was craving authentic tacos, as i reminisced on my favorite taco shop in san francisco.       First stop was Cardenas. It was closer to me but the lines were ridiculous and the environment chaotic. Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much.      As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly  and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again.",1,1
I stop by here on my way to ed fountain park when my son has soccer games.  I usually get tacos and tamales for the team and they love them more than pepes. Definitely a go to place for great Mexican food...cant wait to try other items.,1,1
Very clean and friendly service. I had the Carne asada torta and my friend had tacos overall fairly good.  For a quick bite not bad.,1,1
"I was surprised it was this good it was like a home cooked meal... I purchased one posole, 3 carne asada tacos, 5 fried fish tacos, a combination of carnitas, 1 chicken nugget plate, 2 orchatas and my total was $51 not bad at all.",1,1
Their food is delicious!!! I got Huevos Rancheros and my bf got menudo. He loved it! The lady at the register was friendly and super nice! The coffee is really good too!!,1,1
Great tacos de carne asada.  I really liked the salsa.  I added rice and bean and I am glad I did.  Delicious and very affordable.,1,1
"Wonderful divey taco shop with awesome Mexican food. Highly recommend the tacos dorados, cheese enchiladas and chips with the salsa bar. The flavors are amazing! They must do most of their business as take out since it is so small, but the eating area is clean and nice. Don't be swayed by the strip mall. Definitely worth a stop.",1,1
"I walked in my scrubs and the owner asked me how I found out about his place.  I told him Yelp and that I was in the area for a school assignment and lived across town.  He never heard of Yelp and didnt know that his place has a 5 star rating.  He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego.  If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that.  I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.  I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.  Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole.  The salsa was also fresh and tasty.",1,1
"THE MOST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN.  Do not sleep on this spot, if you are ever in Vegas definitely stop by... I cant think of my favorite dish because you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu; The menudo The cocteles, The enchiladas. Mm everything is bomb! and always great customer service and very clean nice little shop. Love it.",1,1
"Great place if you want some traditional fresh Mexican food ! The over ceviche which is one of my favorite dishes, to to be honest it's one of the best ones I had !",1,1
They have tamarindo! My girlfriend and I have been looking for weeks and finally found our new go to spot!  Thanks!,1,1
Craving for authentic Mexican Food and feeling adventurous and out of your comfort zone. Gotta try this humble and family operated place. Everything I had was simply delicious and would go out of my way to venture in this neighborhood for Tacos and Mexican food  The cashier/server was very friendly and asked if it was my first time here. She answered my questions and made me feel welcomed. I originally was going to order Tacos only but the enchilada combo grab my attention and got the combo with a single order of Carne Asada Taco on the side because I had to get a taco too.   When the order finally arrived at my table. I got the three different salsas that was available at the salsa bar. From the first bite of my taco and enchiladas 1-beef & 2-chicken combination along with the fresh salsas. Every bite was amazingly flavorful and authentic. The whole experience was great and felt like I was taking a short vacation in Mexico!,1,1
Man this place is bomb dot com -  Let me tell you when it comes to Mexican good I'm picky  there's so many spots here in vegas so when something really catches your taste buds then you know lol,1,1
We were in Vegas for a few days and after eating at a number of the expensive resort offerings we found this little diamond in the rough. This place ROCKS! Totally authentic mexican food. The tacos and flautas are legit and hit the spot dead on. We are mexican and we know our cuisine and you can't go wrong eating here. Just stop reading this review and try it. Like now.  Go!,1,1
"Yes its definitely a five star hidden gem. A great pit stop on the way to Moab. Everything was fresh right down to the rice. A nice older couple seem to run the restaurant. The prices are fair, it's probably not not in the best part of N. Vegas but worth trying out, we'll be back.",1,1
"MI Pueblo is the BEST TACO SHOP IN VEGAS. The owners are so sweet and kind. Their food is absolutely delicious. I have had every single meal available here, and I NEVER once had anything that was bland or stale. They Cook everything fresh, despite what others think. Even though I'm guessing those people have never seen the cooks in action. This place is 1 IN A MILLION! I've been going since they've opened in 2008. I have never regretted going there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE OWNERS! It's such a shame when people check in on here to get free food and THEN POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE FOOD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR LOL.  YOU WONT FIND MANY CLOSE TO HOME, DOWN TO EARTH AND DELICIOUS PLACES LIKE THIS.",1,1
I haven't eaten yet but if it tastes half as good as it smells I'll be happy. The staff was super friendly thumbs up!!,1,1
"By far the best burrito and salsa I have ever had. This place is way across town from where I live but i go there just to get my burritos, yes if I'm gonna go across town I better get two burritos to go.",1,1
"Legit food!! I had the chilaquiles with red sauce comes with eggs,  beans and the best rice I've had in a long time.. Definitely recommend this spot. They know how it's done",1,1
"Came here while visiting my friend in Vegas.  We wanted tacos and I'm picky about Mexican food.  This place totally hit the mark.  Not only was it delicious, the lady taking orders was super sweet and a really good salesperson.  I was debating on getting carne asada fries because i had already had fast food that day.  Here's how the convo went:  Her: do you eat them [carne asada fries] every day?   Me: well, no... Her: then they're not so bad then Me: good point  Salsa bar was on point and the spicy carrots and onions were crispy and super hot.  Yum.",1,1
"Once again. The good was hot and fresh tasty, the customer  service  is friendly  and personal. This what to expect from a family owned restaurant.   The burritos  are very nice sized /over sized for your $$ the torta  is good also,  all the food is good sized portions",1,1
"This place is special. All their food is made with the care you would expect at a family gathering. The hospitality is incredible. This is NOT your typical Mexican turn-and-burn kind of place. Every dish I've ordered thus far has been absolutely fantastic...Well assembled and delicious. Personally, I love the ""caldo de pollo"" (chicken soup). I could eat it every day! This establishment is a definite winner in my book!!",1,1
"Best fish tacos! I also like the Carne Asada fries. The first time I had a chicken chile verde burrito.  But once I tried the fish tacos, I was hooked! The other burritos are good, too. My husband loves the pickled/peppered veggies. He gets a bagful and eats them while we wait. Family owned and operated. Friendly, cheerful staff.",1,1
"The food is very tasty, generous portions.  Had the combo with cheese enchilada, Carne Asada taco and chili rellenol with rice and beans.  Hubs had the Carne Asada plate .",1,1
"I really enjoyed it here. The cheese enchiladas and carnitas taco were really good. The staff is very friendly, always nice to see positive happy people. I will be back for sure! give this place a try, you will enjoy it.",1,1
"I really liked the 'mom and pop' feel of this little Mexican restaurant, and the quality of the food was really good. Solid four stars. The complimentary chips and beans I got for my Yelp check-in were excellent. I upgraded to a larger size beans in order to share. You can tell these beans are the real thing.... slow cooked with love for the flavor and not smashed too much. Yum. My husband has the carne asada burrito, it was huge, their version came with rice and beans inside the burrito, a little different than other taco shops I have been to. I had the combination plate, Chicken Enchilada, Chiles Relleno, and Chicken Taco. This plate came with rice and beans. Everything was excellent, but the star of the show was the taco! My next visit I will definitely try some of the other tacos on the menu. The salsas in the salsa bar were amazing, I put it on everything!  So here is the bad news about this place........ the neighborhood! This shopping center and parking lot is scary! There are so many people loitering in front of the next door liquor store. I am glad I was with my husband, I really would not have felt safe coming here without him and coming here after dark.......",1,1
This place is great! The food is amazing. Had a plate of chilaquiles and my wife had the machaca. The portions were generous and tasty. I highly recommend this place if you you in the area and want great Authentic Mexican Food!,1,1
"Outstanding. Visiting Las Vegas and happened upon this place. Having been raised in San Antonio, I feel like I know great Mexican food. And we found it here. The food is very authentic because they know how to build the meal with a great foundation. The chips and homemade tortillas are to die for. We all had various tacos, chicken and asada. Their burritos are huge!  The best part of the meal was the carnitas nachos. Don't miss out on them. When I'm back in vegas again, a meal here will be on my itinerary.",1,1
"Dont sleep on this spot! Consistently great, authentic mexican food. We've tried many other places but continue to return here!",1,1
"Seemed questionable from the outside especially only the outside thou when u walk in the atmosphere changes the cashier / sever name is Sarah she was really helpful I been here twice now I've tried the cabesa tacos, the lague  tacos, fish tacos, the shrimp cocktail  and the carnitas torta with fries all of it was outstanding I am surprised on how good it was they have a large variety of menu options which in sure there all good the cabesa was tender and juicy the torrilla they use was thin and delicious tasted home made fish taco was fresh it was fried still good thou love how fresh the tomatoes where , shrimp was perfect and Devined  correctly had a good amount of avacodo too which I loved , the carnitas were tasteful and not overcooked lettuce was fresh and crunchy over all I would say they put a lot of love in there food which makes it super good new spot for my Mexican food cravings I highly recommend this place",1,1
"Amazing, fresh and inexpensive! First time here and I love it.",1,1
Was in town on a short layover and was looking for some real deal Mexican! This place was so good! The sopes were amazing!!!!!  Will definitely be back when in the area!,1,1
Only 1 review?? C'mon! This place has awesome food!! It's rough around the edges but don't let it fool you. Tacos! Burritos! 3 different soups!,1,1
"Mi Pueblo Taco Shop is a family owned treasure in Las Vegas , Nevada.  Owners Juanita and Manuel make homemade Mexican food in small batches and treat E everyone like family.  It is outstanding.  Paulette Motzko",1,1
"This place is great. I come here almost every day. Today I had a California burrito which was incredible. The fish tacos are always delicious. I really enjoy coming here, the staff is nice and it's always clean.",1,1
Finally found the BEST Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas!! The food is not only fresh but comes in large quantities! Will come back again and will recommend this place to my family and friends!!,1,1
"Bomb! Fresh ingredients!  Yummy to my tummy!  I would highly recommend this gem. This meal hit the spot, next time I'll try the enchiladas.....",1,1
"I will say our expectations were guarded when we pulled up, but step inside and receive a warm greeting and look at the menu, you know all will be good, and it was. The burrito was tasty and plentiful, ""sandwich"" with the fried pork, Pastor tortas, absolutely satisfying, simple and perfect. The hot salsas were fun and tasty. Enjoy",1,1
"Small mom and pop joint. Food is really good here and service is great, super friendly and welcoming.",1,1
Very good I recommend the fish tacos!!! And carne asada tacos! All with red salsa!! Bomb!!!,1,1
Love the place. Been going for years. The coffee is really good too. I always get the special meal and my wife the dosa. Both are great.,1,1
"I am a big Saravana Bhavan fan. Back home in India as well as here. new to Mississauga. food is good. enjoy the buffet specially. Thali with tiny cups and variety dishes is another favourite specially the vata kolambu. I love the cabbage curry too.  samabr vada is another favourite.  I was wondering about the tip money I left for the server. I did not see the server come back for it. but supervisor/manager lady took the money and went inside. I am wondering how much does the server get? I went twice after that day, but did not find the server who had served me. other restaursnts have a tip collection box and the money goes there.  I was charged extra for a coffee I did not drink I brought it to their notice and it was taken off without an apology.  well, I love the food, and I am willing to overlook these thing. D James,  Etobicoke",1,1
"Been in to eat and also have picked up takeout. Great menu, fair prices. Food was solid. I will return.",1,1
Absolutely love the food! Brought many people here for lunch and dinner and they also love the food. I highly recommend masala dosa and gun powder idlys.,1,1
"Ultimate south indian breakfast buffet! Totally satisfied with this place. The staff is friendly,the food is fresh, Dosas are crisp, chutneys are delicious and sambar is to die for! If you're planning to catch up the weekend buffet and don't want to wait then be there by 10.30 a.m.",1,1
Excellent for vegetarians and healthy food. Variety of dishes. If you want taste something different this is the place to go.,1,1
"For my money, Saravana Bhavan is just perfect. food for a great price.  Crispy, smooth dosas and bubbly, chewy uttapam.  The Sambar is just like Dosa in SF, packed full of leaves, seeds, and spices that hit your taste buds in all the right places!  The staff are super nice and kept making sure we were satisfied. ""More sambar, More Chutney?""  Yes, please!  After getting way more than 2 people could eat (come in groups) we packed it up and of course left with more sambar and more chutney.   Sat and Sun, the buffet offers all the south indian food you could eat, (AYCE) and desserts. Try just a bite of these super sugary, fried desserts and think about jogging back to downtown TO.",1,1
"Been to this location thrice at different times. The service has been pretty consistent - quick and efficient. I will not expect more from an Indian restaurant.  The food has been really good for the most part. Here are the things we've tried -  The vada sambar is top-class; fresh, hot, soft and super tasty. The bisibele bath is good with plenty of good flavour. The onion rava masala dosa is crisp and filling - the best I've had. One star off for the rava idli that lacked life... Otherwise you cannot go wrong with anything here!",1,1
"This is going to be a biased review because this chain is from my home city in South India.   Now that's out of the way, this is the best place to get authentic south indian food. If you are a newbie to the cuisine go on Sunday for the buffet when you can try a bit of everything   If you familiar with South Indian food, the mini Idlis, paper masala and the adai aviyal are something that you can always bet will be great.   It's a completely vegetarian joint, so meat eaters might be tad disappointed - the flavour will make up for it, trust me ;)   Enjoy.",1,1
The idlis are so good! The service is wonderful. Rava kesari is the best. Cheese Kara Masala Dosa is also a must try. The quality of food and the speed at which its served is amazing.,1,1
"I really love this place. The paper dosa is so crispy! The potato masala is very mild and the chutneys have varying degrees of spicyness. We also love their Rava Kichadi, Parotta's with potatoes and a delicious cauliflower dish. The Mini Tiffin is a great place to start and try a bit of everything. And don't forget to have some Rasmalai for dessert!  Enchanting!  The Rava Kesari is also delicious.",1,1
"I love the manager here, he knows us for a very long time. I like their food. The servers change so often that we don't like it but still they are much better than a lot of other restaurants.    Food - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5 Management - 5/5",1,1
"I tired their Special Thali today ( only thali on the menu ) and it was fantastic, it was a gloomy day and it was just pefect, 14 items all veggie, it took about 10 minutes to get my order ready, that is kind of odd I would say as they were not busy all all when I entered, that being said it was worth it..the food you could just tell was fresh and clean.  They also renovated, the place looks way better than before, they added some booths as well . so if you are in the mood for some spicy south indian cusine, give this place a try.   Please note: If you are trying south indian food for the first time, it is pretty spicy :)  thanks for reading   PS. the service is a bit  odd but not rude. so dont be surpised if you find your server to be a little odd :)",1,1
"Great Masala Dosa - the mustard seed flavour of the Masala is perfect. The Parotta was good but not excellent: a bit small and not quite the right flavour compared to other Parotta I have had. The Rasmalai dessert is fantastic - although the presentation is nothing like the menu picture (no saffron strands) and suffers as a result.  I will definitely come again if I am in the area. For those new to South Indian food, it would be a great introduction, but those who are picky may not like it as much.",1,1
Love the dosas here. The size of a dosa is smaller here but it is also cheaper. A great bang for your buck. Service is prompt and staff is friendly. The restaurant is usually packed and is also quite spacious,1,1
Somehow after we moved to Mississauga this Sarvana Bhawan was just a block from our new place so obviously we had to check it out.  Come from Madras (the birth place of this chain) I would say it's the same flavour and taste as back home.    It doesn't mean that's it's a great place to eat out south Indian food around here.  There are better options for sure. But if you are looking for good old Sarvana Bhawan taste this one pretty much nails it bang on.,1,1
Best south indian food in Toronto. Everything freshly prepared and I am surprised at all the negative reviews posted by some members. The service was slow but maybe due to the large number of people.,1,1
"Awesome authentic food and well priced Can be quite busy over the weekends Service can be slow, but the food more than makes up for it",1,1
"This place serves the pure vegetarian south Indian cuisine .. even though I am not a pure vegetarian, I do eat out at this restaurant sometimes when I am in a mood for a light meal .. the thing with this kinda food is that no matter how much you eat, it doesn't makes your stomach go rumbling or feel heavy .. so I guess I can go here once in a while .. The ambience isn't that great .. some of the tables are lined up in the middle of the path and I hate sitting in this area. The service is alright, not the fastest but reasonable . Everytime I've been here, I've noticed that the place is kinda crowded .. so there is a lot of noise but then if I choose to eat out then I should not complain about the noise I guess. Food is good if you are not looking for the typical spicy taste that Indian food is known for. Their spice level is pretty low.",1,1
"The food here makes me forget that I'm not eating meat. I'm a carnavore and make few eceptions about not having some meat on my plate, but I have to say I don't even miss it when I eat here. My wife and I have only ever gone for the buffet. I eat my vada with sambar,  my dosa with rice and tomato chutney, and my puri with potato or rice. It tastes amazing and I've never left without being so full that I'm uncomfortable, which is a good thing. The only reason I don't give them five stars is because they need to expand. It's always so busy that the service is close to chaos. But I'd much rather have great food and slow service than great service and terrible food. I recommend this place to any meat lover like myself to prove that the occasional meat free meal can be very enjoyable.",1,1
"The place for Dosa, in my books! This place has always provided the crowds with some great vegetarian food as well as my favourite, dosas! I am not much of a vegetarian, but i would go here for Dosas as well as other tasty dishes.  The service is good, not the best, but still good. The place is clean, and has the sink to wash your hands, without going to the washrooms...a must for your seasoned foodie.",1,1
"I love this place. The dosas are really good and portions are big. The place is very clean and service is the best I've had at an Indian restaurant. The waiters treat you like your at their home. Whenever I'm in town, I go here.",1,1
"It's been a while since i have been to sarvana bhavan and boy had i been missing out. I have been going to another very famous South Indian restaurant which has forgotten how to serve their guests lately and the staff seems to be very arrogant lately.  Sarvana wasn't too busy at the moment of our visit on Sunday night at 9 and the food was delivered quickly. The dosas were delicious and crispy and sambhar was hot and just as i hoped. Staff has always been extremely polite at this place and i really enjoyed going back to a place that gets it right.  Everybody in our group agreed that my favorite dish, paneer dosa, was the best they have ever tried.  Will be going back there soon and telling all my friends about it too.",1,1
"Overall:  Worth the trek to Mississauga.  Great value, great taste, great people.   Room: Not fancy, spacious, clean  Service: Friendly, even avuncular (more materteral), everyone's an auntie, and frankly a bit concerned that i wanted a second coffee   Menu: Thorough south indian menu, tough to decipher without guidance from someone who knows the cuisine  Presentation: Traditional south indian restaurant, paper dosas are intimidatingly big but that's why you get them   Taste:  Delivers on south indian vegetarian goodness.    Value: There's a reason this place is packed with Indians.  Tastes good and cheap!",1,1
"Love the food.. We order thali last time, my god there was so much to eat.. Every bit of dish tastes heavenly..",1,1
"Came here last Saturday with my dad for some dosa.  We were pleasantly surprised with the texture of breads, dosa and the complex flavours of the bateta and chutneys.  The masala tea was also very good.  The channa could use a little bit of work though.  I'll be back.",1,1
Just had a great meal at the newly renovated restaurant. Dark wood and comfortable banquets. The food was excellent as always. Idli were fluffy and the vada were nice and crispy. The cauliflower gravy that comes with paratha was delicious and the service was prompt and pleasant. The best South Indian in the GTA!,1,1
"Delicious inexpensive South Indian food. I had the cauliflower dosa, not often available. Accompanied by sambar and 3 chutneys it was delectably filling for only $8. The new renovation has made dining in very pleasant. If you're a fan of South Indian, don't miss it.",1,1
"Reasonably good food but again the downside with this place, just like most other Indian restaurants is the service. The servers are unsmiling but not as bad as in most other Indian places. Depending on the time of the day, be prepared to endure some heavily irritating and ill mannered crowd. The food is however quite delicious and very fresh. For this reason I will keep on going back.",1,1
"Went for Saturday dinner with 4 ppl.  Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Extremely clean!!!  Love the hand washing station!!!  Great service and fantastic food, however only gave 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons:  (1) waiter forgot to bring our lassi (yet it was charged on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed.. oh well, not too big a deal, it was an accident), and (2) the timing of bringing our dishes.  We ordered one appetizer to share, and four entrees.  One entree came first, several minutes later the appetizer came, and then several minutes later second entree, and several several minutes later the third entree, then much later the last entree came.  It wasn't ideal for us to be eating one at a time, lol.  This is a great restaurant to try if those two things don't bug you :)",1,1
"Consistent good quality, flavors and fast service. My favorite South Indian food option in GTA.",1,1
"Tasty food , nice clean place . prices little bit high for dosas but similar to some others in the area. Try some of the specialty dosas.",1,1
"Great place if you want to taste real South Indian food. Great customer service. The food was tasty, specially their Special Meal with different curries and rice. So far I have had very experience with this place after several visits.",1,1
"I've been to both the Scarborough and Mississauga locations and I prefer the Mississauga one because of cleanliness and also they have washroom and hand-washing area tucked away in the corner.   This time I ordered the paper dosa, sweet lassi and the special madras coffee.  The dosa and lassi were great.  The coffee was awesome! I'm not a coffee drinker but I liked that fact that it wasn't strong (they can make it strong if you want it that way) and I asked for sugar on the side. It comes in a cute little stainless cup in a small bowl and it has a lot of froth on top.  All in all a tasty meal.  At the end (where the cashier sits) I had some of the saunf (fennel) with candy...its good for digestion and its nice to eat something sweet (and free) at the end of the meal.",1,1
Saravana Bhawan has regained its touch after the last review though the Manager can certainly work on his attitude.,1,1
It's inside the mall and the food is awesome! Probably the best authentic Chinese dinner you can have on Christmas Eve in North Carolina. Just don't peek in the kitchen. You're all good.,1,1
A diamond in the rough... I get off the highway just to grab lunch from here. Remind me of the authentic Chinese take outs in NYC,1,1
"It helps to have someone understand the language while in the Hong Kong BBQ, but they do have english menus that you can use on the counter.  It is pretty cheap for some good food.  Just ignore the pig hanging from the ceiling if you find that gross and also ignore the food rating as I survived my visit and I am sure you will yours.  Just make sure to wipe down your silverware when you get them.  Personally I really liked the BBQ pork which you can see hanging with all the meat in little strips; which, they cut up and serve with rice is really good.",1,1
"This is as authentic as you're going to get.  I'll be straight up when I say that places like this can make me nervous.  The mall itself is sketchy...and it's in a sketchy part of town.  I make it this way every few weeks for some bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ at Le's, but came on a day that Le's was closed.  Dim sum?...or the place with ducks hanging in the window?  We opted for the ducks in the window and chose Hong Kong BBQ.  When you enter Hong Kong BBQ...you can tell there's going to be a communication issue.  There is literally...not a single thing resembling ""American"" in this restaurant.  I knew I was going to like this place.  I did my best not to look back at the kitchen.  We all know what that is going to look like...and I'd rather play dumb.  Dangit!  I looked.  The service was quick and the food was great!  We were even entertained with Chinese soccer on their small TV.  I'd recommend coming here if you're an adventurous person...otherwise...you'll never make it as far as the door...much less the table.",1,1
"Pretty run of the mill mom & pop shop, roast pork & bbq pork is sold at $9 a lb. and what can I say the bbq is pretty on par with what I can get in Boston both crispy and flavorful respectfully. Great to know I can find some comfort food in Charlotte.",1,1
This is definitely a hole in the wall place. I was actually picking up banh mi sandwiches and saw this place. The duck and pork were prepared as well as the places I go to in ATL. I will definitely be stopping by this place again when I'm in the area.,1,1
"If you need to buy a car, call Edit Omar!  There are so many sales people out there that don't listen to what you want. And I'm in sales! Edit took the time to go through all the features, specs and pricing. She even clued into the fact that it was me buying the car and handed me the keys for the test drive. (so many car salesmen just talk to the husband...hello, the car is for me..)  She even stayed late so I could pick up my car the day it was ready. ** note - the next guy up the food chain will try and sell you the Audi Care Package. Worth getting, but as I said before  he was again speaking to the wrong purchaser, so I opted to buy it from Edit the next day.  ;)",1,1
"Just bought a new A4 from Keif Grey. What a great atmosphere at the dealership, no pressure from Keif or Alexandra in finance and everyone else was very friendly also. Buying a car can be very intimidating and they took all that away.  Robin the sales manager also helped make my decision easy.  Would recommend them to anyone looking for a new or used Audi.   Thank you.",1,1
"The most professional, organized, and attentive Audi dealership I have stepped foot in. Great showroom and awesome downtown location. Great for test drives. Low pressure customer oriented approach",1,1
The food truck is a welcoming asset for a guest from out of town. The food truck is named fire*and*foraged and is amazing. The beer is also amazing. In my book this nanobrewery/food truck combo is definitely a double dividend!! The dark beers on nitro rock on the flavor profile!!,1,1
Just went here for lunch and it was really wonderful. We had the burger from Fire and Forage and the B.L.A.T.. Both REALLY good. Great atmosphere too,1,1
First time in Phoenix and went to Shop Beer Co on recommendation.  Great outdoor space. Cooled by misters and comfortable even when outside temps are 100+.  Great craft beer that is all brewed in house.  Great food truck out back that rotates.  Come by and check out if in Phoenix area.,1,1
"The Shop has pretty good beer and I like the fact that they have a few guest brews too.  The outdoor area is great and having a food truck on hand is always a nice touch in case you imbibe a little too much.    If you're looking for a day drinking spot, look no further.  This place is ideal.",1,1
Great selections of beer. You can get a crowler there and the food is mighty fine. I'll be back.,1,1
"First timer.  My wife heard about this place at the dentist in east Mesa this morning.  It's tucked away in Tempe off Rio Salado.  Great selection of craft beers, my first brew was The Nines.  Great Red Ale, very smooth even though it's IBU was 90.  My wife had the Coffee Brown Nitro which was awesome.  What a find after a root canal!",1,1
"This place is amazing. I tried the nines, coffee brown nitro, and (480) session pale ale. All are the perfect beer for whatever your feeling that night.   I made the mistake of grabbing food before heading over, the food truck looked legit.  5 stars. You need to come here if you're in Tempe.",1,1
"First and foremost, I seriously love this place!   First look:   The whole place has a very cool, very inviting vibe.  The decor (industrial, rustic wood mixed with some seriously cool and unique art) hangout areas (sweet beer garden), lighting that makes everyone look pretty/handsome (with or without beer goggles) and a window looking into the brewery operation.  These features make it a really special place.  Even the restrooms are rad. It looks like a lot of love went into every detail.  The Beer: This is a true tasting room.  I equate it to going to your favorite wine tasting room and enjoying the various types of wine, except it's delicious beer (obviously). (e.g.; the Nines, you gotta try the Nines!). What it is not is a pub or a sports bar with super loud people, Budweiser and NFL whistles blowing from 50 TV screens...which is refreshing.  I feel a person just starting to develop their beer palette would feel right at home bellying up to the bar along side a person with a honed, mature beer palette. It's a place to try and sample what suits your beerbuds best.  With tons of amazing beer options that have awesome names you know have a story behind them, you can't go wrong.  My husband tried the coffee brown ale and he loved it! Oh, and it looks like they offer special ""reserve"" and yummy flavored type brews each week as well.  Best to check out their Insta and Facebook pages for weekly beer offering updates.  The staff: Great staff,  knowledgeable, welcoming, efficient and accommodating.  Eager to make you feel right at home.  The food: I've eaten many burgers in my life, let me tell you.  Had the most delicious. burger. ever from the onsite food truck.  I think they are called, Fire and Forged.  Like the Shop, the food truck folks took great care to give me their best.  Quality beef cooked to medium rare perfection. Homemade pickles (homemade pickles people! Who does that!?!).  Real/non-iceberg lettuce.  Some seriously special sauce, too.  Paired wonderfully with the Nines! (See what I did there? )  Overall: Great night out with the Mr. Even bought a couple super softy shirts and of course bought a few cans of the Nines to take home to CA.  Do yourself (and your mouth) a favor and get over to the Shop.  They are doing some seriously good work there.  Wish we had one back home...",1,1
Great beer and venue.  Like how the beertender was mellow despite some Tempe bartender douchebag telling him he needed to speak louder and with more authority.  The pale ale is surprisingly more hopped and higher IBU than the IPA.  I enjoyed IT.  They have a food truck out back and a huge patio so could be a great place to bring dogs as well.,1,1
"The Shop is one of my go to jams for craft beers with a solid vibe. The staff is extremely knowledgeable/helpful and it shows in the beers they produce. They have a food truck in their patio area that has a constant presence; the chef consistently rotates the menu with all kinds of goodness that pairs fantastic with the brew. Must try beers when you go are Church Music & F.Y.I.T.M. ..... However, you can't go wrong in any selection you make. Might as well take a flight or two and experience for yourself. Cheers",1,1
"This place gets an A+ for style and beer.  The ceiling of this building is beautiful!  The taproom is super comfortable and the patio is spacious and clean.  They have a permanent food truck that turns out burgers and other beer friendly food.  I had the hoppy red and the 480 pale ale.  I was very hoppy, I mean happy, with both.",1,1
"There a a few times in life when we find a beer so expertly crafted we want to linger and savor the time and wisdom of our experience. This is one of those moments. My personal favorite  ""The Nines"" is an Ale with balanced fresh caramel elements to complement its Red identity.   The mellow yet vibrant atmosphere encourages your senses and stimulates your consciousness.   Enjoy!",1,1
"Awesome Brewery! I stumbled across this place on it's opening day, at least the opening to the public, and even that's kind of an opening. Today was friends and family day, and special invited people, but if the public showed up but let them in and give them a free beer! So, I showed up!... and who did I get to meet but Harry Mitchell, Kelli Butler, Dr. Eric Meyer, and a whole bunch of people who really love brewing craft beer. It was a great crowd, and excellent beer. There were two food trucks, one served poutine made Southwestern style, and instead of french fries, they sliced up tamales, and served the gravy and chilies on the top of that! By the way, that food truck was run by a guy named Craig. I had tried three of their beers the pale ale the IPA and the red and they were all excellent beers. I been to them before when they were cartel brewing and they were over in the old apartment building, and when they were in the coffee shop, but this venue is really nice and the the energy is palpable! I definitely will come back here, even when there are no political celebrities!",1,1
"Totally cool hangout! I found this place when I was out jogging around Tempe Town Lake. It's a quaint little house with a really cool patio. They have about six beers that they brew and another six to eight beers that they bring in. There's a food truck parked on site, I ordered the street tacos.  I love the inside as much as the outside. There are plenty of tables, high tops, low tops and  bar seating.  This place has a cool vibe. Staff is friendly. They were more than happy to give samples of their brews with no charge. That, in my opinion, is good business. I will definitely be back for another visit .....soon!  Loved it!",1,1
"The Shop is THE BEST LOCAL INDEPENDENT BEER in the Phoenix Metro Area! Check them out... clean chill tasting room, incredible staff, and outstanding Fire & Forged food truck in the beer garden... 5 STARS oh and of course GREAT BEER!",1,1
"Great little patio, good beer, one of my first picks for a spot to hang out and relax, now I just need to figure out what to do with my kids so I can do that more often.  There is a food truck always on site, so it is really just a kitchen in a box, I don't know why they took that route but I assume it is a permit based decision.   The nitro stout I had was everything one would expect it to be.",1,1
"Live right down the block and am a regular here. Good beer selection with friendly service who continuously checked up on us.  The food from the food truck served the basics: burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, but they're all well done and cheap. The times I come late from work, I walk over and have a great cheap meal with a pint.  Love this place.",1,1
"New to the neighborhood, and certainly a welcome addition. This place is worth taking the path off Mill. Great beer, staff and vibe. Do yourself a favor, and stop in savor the flavor. ""I just made that up"" :)",1,1
Great new place to have a some tasty microbrewery beer. Super friendly staff. 4-6 of their own beers available.  Food trucks on site if you get the munchies. Coffee Brown Nitro was my favorite.,1,1
"The Shop Beer Co. knows what they are doing! I went here last weekend with some friends, and had a wonderful experience. The staff was very friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was really great. There is a beer garden out back complete with a food truck and plenty of seating. I had their Sunset Daydream IPA & it was delicious! Very refreshing, summery with the right amount of hops. I will definitely be coming back, and would recommend this as a great spot to come with friends or to grab a quick beer after dinner!",1,1
I checked this brewery out with a groupon for 4 people. Beer and service was great! The location is weird since it's in a residential area but the place itself was very cool! Indoor and outdoor and the weather was just perfect for outdoor seating. We didn't try the food truck but it smelled delicious. I will definitely be going again and I suggest y'all try it! Groupon has a sweet deal for this brewery,1,1
"Keepin' it simple & all about the beer! Love the vibe. No TVs, no sports games blaring. Just drink some beers and talk to your friends! They had a few different IPAs on tap, of course I tried them all. We had just ate dinner elsewhere, so we skipped the food truck, but will definitely be back to try!! They're just getting started, and I'm excited to see what's next for this new spot!",1,1
"Had an awesome experience with my girlfriend over he weekend. The Church Music IPA and the ""Fight-Em"" DIPA were both ridiculously smooth. The food truck outside offered reasonable sandwiches to split and expedited service. I rate the whole experience as a 10 out of 10 and can't wait for my next trip back there. Additionally I purchased a t-shirt that fit perfectly and is quite comfortable.",1,1
"Always looking for new beers to try. Having ""the nines"". Great taste. Very friendly. Amazing atmosphere.",1,1
Ambience was great - small beer tap confusion on the second pour but overall great experience,1,1
"A little bit off the beaten path, but defiantly worth the trip. GREAT selection of beers. Cool little tasting room, and a food truck outside. I sampled plenty of beer, but didn't try any food, I will next time! What ever you guys are doing, KEEP IT UP!",1,1
There's a great Groupon out for the place. I would Highly recommend the restaurant to any locals in the area that enjoy a good beer,1,1
"Awesome beers, awesome tasting room, great service.  Met Dave and he got me all hot and bothered.",1,1
"Excellent beer. Best brewery we visited on our short trip to Phoenix. Their collaboration with Modern Times ""BINGO BANGO BONGO IPA"" was amazing. We didn't get a chance to try the food, but we will definitely be back next time we are in the area.",1,1
"The guys running this place are awesome. They are very knowledgeable and friendly, and have turned this into one of the best places in Tempe. I have been a few times and the first time I thought it was difficult to find coming from Mill and around the train tracks. This time I came right off Rio Salado and it was right there. Much easier coming from that side.   They have a great selection of beers, and always something new. The DIPA is a staple and one of the best in town. I had a couple of new IPAs this time (Church Music and Circus Bandit). Both were great. They also have crowlers available in the cooler. They do not have a food kitchen, but there is a food truck that stays there and serves excellent food. The inside bar is very nice with a lot of space, but for me the real highlight (at least for most of the year) is the patio. It is very large, has some trees, a portion of it is under a roof and makes for a great time. This past visit it was a perfect afternoon with good weather, a nice breeze, good music, and awesome beer. I could chill out there all evening.  Definitely one of my favorite breweries in Phoenix and it's run by great people. I will always support them and their beers.",1,1
"Great Beer, great atmosphere, great people!!! Yep the Cartel guys can't go wrong with good peeps and good beer!! Love the beer garden!",1,1
"This is a neat little brewery.  They currently have four of their own beers on tap.  I tried the Hoppy Red, the Sunset Daydream IPA and the Coffee Brown on nitro.  All three of them were pretty good.  The also have a nice food truck in the parking lot.  You order the food at the truck and then they find you and deliver it to where you're sitting inside.  The servers were all friendly and very knowledgeable about craft beer.",1,1
We love local beer and couldn't wait to pop in here.  Love it!!  Good selection of dark beers. The coffee brown nitro is my favorite. I think more breweries need to make dark beers. They are smoother and less hoppy.,1,1
"Great beer, great atmosphere with a really nice outdoor patio. We moved here recently from Chicago where food trucks are big at many tap rooms, none though serve food as good as what we enjoyed here from Fire & Foraged. Everything about this place is 5 stars.",1,1
"Bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable of their brews.  Beer is brewed to perfection. Clean and great prices. Food truck on property with a lunch box special that comes with food and a beer for $6, can't beat it! Food is awesome! Great place to have a beer with the people you love. Highly recommend trying it out. We will definitely be coming back!",1,1
"My friend told me about this place and it has easily become my new favorite local brewery. I usually come here on Wednesday's for their Randall (they infuse one of their beers with some other yummy ingredients)--I just recently had their pale ale with persimmons, dates and currants and it was so tasty! The food truck out back (Fire & Forged) cooks up some amazing, fresh food and switches up their menu frequently. The back patio is beautiful and dog-friendly. This place just kills it all around.",1,1
"Jason, Matt, Dyllon, and Dave. Great little venue! Beers are awesome and the mood is just right. If you are looking for that spot this is it. I wish you all the best and thanks for making my business a success with the local crafted beer from your brewery. I carry four of the six beers you craft and my customers up here love them. If you are ever in the neighborhood and looking for a great pairing of local crafted beers and true farm to table seafood and steaks then stop in and say hello! We are located at 32409 N Scottsdale rd. #107 Scottsdale Az. 85266. The Bourbon Cellar. We are in the Summit Plaza. CHEERS!",1,1
"Was in on Sunday evening. Very welcoming greeting from Brittany. Had a couple of samples. Brittany was very knowledgeable and got us just the beer we wanted. That FYITM is great. Craig at the food truck was super friendly as well. Food was awesome. Want that burger again already. The Shop has a great ambiance, better beer, and even better service. Cheers Brittany and The Shop.",1,1
"My wife found this place on Groupon and it was a great bang for your buck. Not to big of a selection on house beers, IPA'S & coffee. The place seemed a little quiet, I'm sure it was just the night of the week we went but still a great atmosphere. I would definitely go again.",1,1
"Hooray for The Shop Beer Co! They really have the small-neighborhood-brewery thing down pat. I had the pleasure of chatting with one of the brewers, Andy, at the Strong Beer Festival while sampling their limited edition releases specifically for said event. The beers I tried there were AMAZING! One was the FYITM another was a special FYITM [i think a fruity version], and something else I can't recall.   A week or so after, I host a Sunday Funday at The Shop for a large group of friends and luckily remembered to tell Andy about it at the Festival. He and his team were gracious enough to reserve space for our group. The weather didn't want to cooperate that Sunday but when I arrived it was fairly dead inside so I pushed together large floor tables in the corner with no problems. Andy did such a great job going over the beer list many times as people came in at varied times as well as keeping track of what we ordered and making sure the glasses did not run dry. I definitely recommend doing the flight - it's $8 for 4 samples which can be a mix from The Shop and/or some from their guest beers. If I have to pick just 2 beers from The Shop to drink, #1 is the Galactic Porter Patrol nitro, #2 is Circus Bandit.   I also recommend their food truck outside. While the guy/waiter wasn't the kindest, the food was fabulous. I really loved the chicken tacos I had. Other positives I noted were the hummus dip and burger. I believe the food menu changes often [don't quote me]. Their ordering system is kind of confusing because you have to order beer & food separately but they come out on one check. How they keep that organized, I would like to know.",1,1
"This place is AMAZING. My favorite things about it:  1. The beer (obviously). Bingo Bango Bongo is beyond superb, as is Church Music and of course the ol' standard, F.Y.I.T.M.  2. The music. Seriously, do you guys have a Pandora station? Whoever set that up has excellent taste and the music matches the atmosphere really well.  3. The service, both inside and at their partner food truck outside.   You can't beat this place for a relaxing Saturday afternoon hang out or great happy hour spot. Love The Shop!!",1,1
Great little brewery. I love places like this that are smaller and cozy. Nice wood inspired interior with exposed trusses and wooden bar tops. 15 beers on tap; 7 of their beers and 8 guest beers. I'll definitely be back.,1,1
Food is amazing and the people are really friendly! shop is tucked away so dont miss it,1,1
"Great service (Amanda) and solid but average beer. This place has potential, and they are clean with their styles if not adventurous. I look forward to what their future may hold.",1,1
"This is an awesome neighborhood brewery. It looks like someone's house with a food truck parked outside of it; apparently it was Mayor Mitchell's dad's home?   Anyway, they have their own selection of brews as well as some guest beers. So far my favorites have been the Coffee Brown Nitro and the Circus Bandit. Many of their beers are a bit too hoppy for my taste, but their porters have been great. Their guest beer selections are usually pretty solid picks as well.   Every Wednesday they do a special brew called ""The Randall"" that they infuse with their flavors of the week. Recently it was thin mints, once it was jalapenos and sometimes they serve it with an accompanying bite (once it was a donut). Follow them on Instagram for Randall announcements as well as updates about entertainment, sometimes they host bands on the patio.  They do have a food truck, Fire and Foraged, which is basically a permanent on-site fixture. They are super creative with their food and have one of the best burgers I've ever had. They source a lot of their food locally-greens from Rhiba Farms and meat from Doublecheck Ranch-and as much as I hate not being able to rely on my favorites, I like that I'm hardly eve disappointed when I try something new. I recently had a salad here with hummus on it and who knew that salad needed hummus?!   The space is cool-lots of patio seating, about 12 seats a the bar indoors and eight 4-tops. This could be a great option to buyout for a birthday party or small wedding reception to be honest; it has nice ambiance!  This is a nice reliable place, walking distance from my house that I can just have a beer, a snack and leave pretty happy about all of it.",1,1
"Despite how humble and unassuming their outside is, this is in the running for one of my favorite arizona breweries.   Beers I sampled:  The nines red: smokey but balanced all the way through.  Bingo bango boingo: top ten IPAs I've had in my life. Super hoppy without the bitter taste. Would love an IV drip of this... Desert pale: usually I cling to pales but this one was overshadowed by how amazing everything else was  But wait there's more!  Then we start talking to the owner of the food truck planted outside, Craig. Solid guy. Lots of experience in the Fox concepts and Vegas restaurants and we got to chat him up about his experience. Really great guy. We ended up getting the meat and cheese board and he knew everything  about where the meats were from, where the veggies came from, how they were pickled and everything. Can't speak highly enough of Craig or this place.",1,1
Came here on a Sunday afternoon. The vibe here is super cool and the atmosphere is inviting. This place is just getting started as it's only a few months old. I just wish we had pieces of paper to write our beer flight choices down.,1,1
Amazing beer garden! Fantastic beer - love the 480! Great staff! This is already my favorite hang out place!,1,1
"Grab a glass and hit the beer garden! This amazing brewery in Tempe has a unique hip vibe with laid back attitude. A place you can definitely taste one of a kind beer flavors as you kick back with friends. We happened to visit during non-peak hours and we're lucky enough to spread out at a picnic table outside. From the patio lights and graffiti art, to the food truck and viewable brewery, the backyard neighborhood personality shines through. Enjoyed the 'Church Music' and 'F.Y.I.T.M' brews. Definitely a place I'd like to hit up again!",1,1
This is such a great place! I love craft beer and I'm happy to support local businesses. This might be our regular spot in Tempe. It's better than going out to Mill Ave with all of those bud light beers.,1,1
What a great spot and atmosphere! Oh and their beer is some of the best AZ stuff around! Can't wait to day drink there.,1,1
the staff are friendly and the beers was good.  those who like old school strong ipa the FYITM was made for you. ask what it stands for.  I got a 32 oz can just for the name.  good beer overall. Alley enjoyed her time there.  everyone was friendly to her and the neighborhood had plenty of cats.,1,1
"Lots of hoppy IPA type of beers, friendly staff cool concept and always a different food truck",1,1
"Came here because they had a really good Groupon. Left extremely happy! The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of their beer. We had a couple flights, liked them all. Had a couple pints and left with a couple crowlers. They have a permanent food truck outside that had some great choices and the owner and head chef came around to check on his customers. Next time I'm back in town I'll definitely be back. Keep up the good work!",1,1
"This place is great. The ceilings! That patio!  Ahh, it has such perfect lighting. I tried the nines & a special beer infused with tequila in celebration of Mexican Independence Day. Both good beers. Would be a lovely spot for small events. Talented group of people brought this place to life!",1,1
Awesome and cool place. Service was good and the beer even better. I had a flight of 4 and the double IPA is simply great should have taken a crowler of it home. Will definitely be back!,1,1
"Love this place! All bartenders are amazing, service is great, has a very homey feeling and being able to hang out with the owners and brewers while you drink is exactly what you want out of a brewery! Amazing beer, especially the F.Y.I.T.M.! I recommend it to everyone I know! Added bonus....the food truck, fire and foraged is absolutely unbelievable! All local. All grass fed. Always on sight!",1,1
"Very nice!!! Great live music. Young people, truck food,  prices alright, good location.",1,1
"Small place with three solid dark beers on tap, in addition to the more usual ipas and wheats. Enjoyed our beers very much, the server was helpful and sweet, very pleased'",1,1
This place is amazing! I cannot recommend it enough from the staff to the food to their beers... I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could! We came here because of their awesome Groupon deal but we will definitely be back! They've only been open for 3 months but they are already doing a great job! If you're looking for a low key cool vibe type of place this is the place for you. It's really a hidden gem so hopefully it stays on the DL for awhile longer.,1,1
Great place to have a few beers. They have a awesome outside sitting area and with the weather now you can't beat it. The server takes her time and explains the beers to you and offers suggestions. Can't wait until I have time to go back again,1,1
"Incredible asian fusion, and an impressive sake list, if you like that sort of thing. Mmmmm... coconut-crusted mahi mahi.... Just start ordering and keep going until you are full.  But save room for the dessert sampler plate.",1,1
"I really love Kushi Bar, it's the kind of place that I wouldn't be embarrassed to take my old friends from Boston or New York to. The sweet potato fries are fantastic and the dipping sauce just adds fuel to my firey addiction to sriracha. For vegetarians, I recommend the house salad (kumquats!), kimchi tofu, mushrooms, curry veggie and rice bowl and wash it all down with the gin rickey.",1,1
"I'm a little wary of Asian fusion restaurants, and I wasn't sure quite what to expect from Muramoto, but my dining partners (a chef and a personal chef) and I were thoroughly pleased with our light dinner on Saturday evening.   We had two rolls, one eel and avocado and another tuna, avocado and some other stuff - both were fantastic. After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time.  Actually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu.   Contrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came.   BTW, make reservations. We weren't in a hurry, so we went and had a drink and came back, but the dining area is quite small, so if you have more than two people you'll definitely want to call ahead on a weekend evening.",1,1
"Muramoto is a paradise if you are a sake lover. Their collection is enormous and I believed the owner claimed Muramoto has the best collection in midwest. If you are a sake lover and haven't been there, what  are you waiting for? and if you don't usually drink sake, you should still try the sake out (especially the ones list under fragrant) and you might change your view about sake forever.  For the food Muramoto is Asian fusion in tapas style. Although each plate might be only around $10, most of them are not filling (rolls are the exceptions) and at the end combining your sake bill the check might cost as much as $100 per person.",1,1
"[NOTE:  this review is about Restaurant Muramoto, which used to be in the location currently occupied by Kushi Bar, but has since moved down the street 2 blocks.]  In a handful of visits since it opened a few years ago, I've found Muramoto to have generally outstanding food and often less-than-ideal service.  IMO, the former more than makes up for the latter, which is at its worst just a bit slow and unconcerned.  (Once, for example, we were two dishes into our meal before our first round of drinks arrived.)  But, ahh, the food.  This is probably the most creative food in Madison.  I describe it as pan-asian fusion in a tapas form factor.  There is some sushi, and some is even pretty good (I'm thinking of the signature duck mango avocado rolls).  That said, it's a mistake to think of Muramoto as a sushi place, though (there is a Muramoto sushi restaurant in the hilldale area ) -- my favorite dishes here have included the soy cod, a lamb curry, and a few amazing salads.  In my experience, the oft-changing menu contains little that isn't great -- an omnivore with an open-minded palate could safely close their eyes and just start pointing.  Come with an appetite and prepare to spend a bit of change (dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert will exceed $100), and avoid the tables in the front near the door on cold days.",1,1
"Wandered in here looking for the restaurant and they told me to go down the street.  They have some food, but it's not the same as the full restaurant.  However, their shochu drinks are more extensive at this location, so I had a shochu shiso mojito.  It was okay--not my favorite, but not bad either.  Maybe I should have tried a drink that wasn't trying to be another drink.    Anyway, the place is really nice, the bartenders are really nice.  Well worth a visit.",1,1
best meal i had since coming to Madison.(Been here 2 months) I would say that this place serves fusion Japanese Food. My recommendation is that this is the place to go with friends so that you can share dishes and try more stuff. Food quality is top notch and each dish really offers you a new experience. Only gripe about the place is that portions are SMALL and it's relatively pricey. expect to spend 20 plus per pax. A must try is their dessert sampler! Definitely going back : ),1,1
"Although I regularly miss Dog Eat Dog around noon every week day, I'm pleased that Muramoto replaced it and gave us a place to blow our cash on Sunday nights. The chef's tasting is key. And use the bathroom with the sink that makes you want to get out your GI Joes and Barbies and play in the bubbles all night.",1,1
"Who says the Midwest can't have tasty seafood?  Dim and intimate, Muramoto is easily one of my favorites places in Madison.  A varied menu with some fantastic Asian-inspired cuisine, this ain't your grandmother's Friday night fish fry.  Update:  swing by on Sunday night to try the blind chef's tasting.  4 courses ending in dessert for $30.  Never disappointing.",1,1
"I am infatuated with my new love, Muramoto. At first, I was highly doubtful the state of Wisconsin could feature decent sushi but boy oh boy was I wrong. Mad props incredibly for the fact that they feature a deeeelicious Philly role with salmon and cream cheese. Heavenly! I enjoy the fact that they serve their edamame with big grains of salt to give it an extra kick. And last but certainly not least, I could drink a million of the Russian teas (a smooth mixture of kahlua and green tea vodka, which I have never tried or seen before this restaurant introduced me to it!)   I end my Valentine to Muramoto with a shout out to its modern decor that made me feel like I was in big city again, and that it smells like fresh sushi on the inside, since most Japanese restaurants don't smell like anything! This is the first place of many in Madison that I have graced with 5 stars because I was that impressed!",1,1
"There were only a handful of rolls available at $10 each that are very fulfilling.  I would recommend the soft shell crab roll.  For some reason the Duck, Mango and Avocado roll made my stomach really queasy.  I didn't try the sake because it was a Monday night, but I would come back for the oyster shot!  A mixture of oyster, raw quail egg and spices it was something very unique!  I had two before my meal.  Slurrrrrp!",1,1
"Yep, I did it- 5 stars.  After a few missed attempts at going to muramoto, we finally made it in.  We tried some sake to start it off, and the Wakatake was superb- at the suggestion of the waiter. Next were the oyster/quail egg shots. What a nice melding of flavors. This was followed by the corn/lemongrass chowder- big disappointment, but I'll let it slide.  On to the main courses- started with the tuna/mayo roll. This was a quite a big portion and really was a great sushi roll for those that like the bells and whistles. The hangar steak was tasty. The bleu cheese sauce was just perfect and made the steak that much better. Could have used just a tad more crust on the meat. Finally, we had the miso black cod. This is how fish should taste. It melted in your mouth, and was salty, but in a great way.   TIP- go early or late (after 9) because they don't take reservations.",1,1
"Yum!  Muramoto is really the best place in Madison for Sushi.  Period.  The service is always great, not just that they are prompt and attentive, but they know the menu and the drink menu and can make intelligent recommendations that I am usually pleased with.  Muramoto's creative rolls are SO delicious, they are all different tasting and the only comparison to their taste comes from good sushi places in Chicago.  I get take out here at least once a week and dine here about once or twice a month.  If you want fantastic sushi at really a quite reasonable price, this is your place!",1,1
"Muramoto has moved into its new space and its all good (great space, expanded menu, same great staff)...but, I strangely miss the old space. Maybe some therapy for this reviewer.",1,1
"I will never look at sushi the same way again!  I am a huge sushi addict, and this is above and beyond the best place to get your ""fix"" in Madison.  It even beats the places in DC that I've tried, and they do a cool new take on  rolls.  Everything was fantastic, my date and I ate 'til we were stuffed...then had dessert on top of that (a delicious creme brulee).  At $10 a roll, these are more than worth the price..they are huge and come with their own individual sauces...no wasabi or soy needed.  We had a saki flight...not my thing, but good to try once I guess.  Service was great and I love the atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back!",1,1
"The food here is amazing.  Kushi is like Japanese tapas - all small plate dishes here.  I went here on a date and enjoyed everything we ordered.  It was pretty deserted on a Tuesday night, but I've seen more people there on the weekend.  The ambiance is loungy - and pretty dark, so it gives off a romantic vibe.  A bit expensive, but worth it.",1,1
"Muramoto is a very good restaurant if you enjoy a limited selection of very good things.  The duck roll is outstanding as are the oyster shots, which are my favorite way to start dinner.  Criticism-wise, there is a bit of a problem with seating in the wintertime, as there is quite a draft coming in from the door if you sit too close to it.  Moreover, you cannot make reservations at Muramoto.  This means of course that you cannot request a table further away from the door if you want to in advance (first come first serve).  Service is just fine, ambiance is lovely.  Come with a date, not your kids and definitely not in your red UW sweatshirt.  Dress to impress; this is a spot for grownups only.  !!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!  Downtown Muramoto has moved to an new location, which is interestingly just down the road from their old location.  This solves the drafty chill issue, there are LOTS more seats, and you can now make rezzos.  On the downswing, it's missing something of its original, uniquely Madisonian charm.  It now has vaulted ceilings, adequate lighting, and at least one waitress of questionable moral character.  Plus they have an additional location by the Hilldale Mall which is yet another step down.  I think what I'm saying is that Muramoto sold out to the man and is now no longer actually hip or trendy.  But honestly, it's still quite nice and the food is very good.  The new Hilldale location does not have the oyster shots, but they do have a delicious octopus salad which knocks me sockies off.  You might as well keep going.",1,1
"Graduated in 2012, school was ok. Nothing really hard even though I took honor classes and one Peggy Pane class. Some of the teachers are cool though such as Ms. Gazier. Take her if you take honors chem. There's also Mr. Barkdoll. He's always funny and makes math really fun. Another teacher would be Mr. Bailey. Very easy going guy and an easy A if you show some effort and not be obnoxious. Some of the stuff isn't mandatory, such as Pep rallys, just sleep in and go to class 15 minutes before the pep rally ends. Basically, just enjoy high school on how easy and how little responsibilities you have before going to college.",1,1
"Has the only Peggy Payne Academy in the world that I know of, which is amazing!",1,1
"Good football team, wish they could be as good as the 5A schools but beggers can't be choosers. Best baseball team I have ever seen.  Once a charger, always a charger!",1,1
"First time to come here and I liked the full package... Service, manicure, variety of colors and the place is clean and has a great ambience. Definitely a favorite! ;)",1,1
I love this place! Kenny is awesome! The owner is super cool and friendly. I have been coming here for 4 years and I would never go anywhere else. It's nice and clean and bright and open. I have been getting my nails done for 18 years and this is by far the best nail salon I have been to.,1,1
First time at this place and they just got a loyal customer. Service was amazing and the spa pedicure was the best I've had in years! The gels nails were also great and a great hand/arm massage to come with. The price wasn't bad either!!! I am definitely coming back!!!,1,1
"I love this nail shop and I am very, very particular. It's super clean, with disposal liners in the pedi chairs. The decor is very cute. They have coffee and water for clients. They're a a wide variety of colors and brands of polish. Love Teresa's work and Tina gives great pedis too. They ensure their customers are happy.",1,1
This place is so clean. They engage you and talk directly to you and no cross talking. The owner runs a tight ship and you can tell. I really like coming here and always leave satisfied. They do such a good job. A spa pedi is only 22 and its amazing. Go here!,1,1
"Awesome experience, Brenda took her time and did a great job. Salon was clean, prices were reasonable.",1,1
This Salon is beautiful.. Very clean..people are friendly... Diana Hackett is amazing....great nails ..great Pedis',1,1
"Came here yesterday for a gel mani and pedi . Clean salon and disposable liners in foot tubs Appreciated that they soaked my acrylic off instead of trying to ""pop"" them off . Tina did both my hands and feet and both are completely on point . Not to mention she took extra care and detail , plus the massage was amazing . I like that they offer a menu of ad ons for their pedicures as well , I love options . I will be back to this salon and will book an appointment with Tina again . Thanks Guys !",1,1
"love this nail salon. i read the reviews on yelp and decided to try.  each experience has been positive, i've been going every 2-3 weeks since march.  i generally get a pedicure and gel manicure.  I haven't had the same technician twice but i always walk out happy with my nails and toes and get loads of compliments.    the have great selection of gel/ shellac/ gelish polishes, can almost always find colors that match the regular polish near perfectly. prices are good, they have different pedicure choices you can add on and different types of pedicures to encompass all their different services.   go during the week!  their weekends are insanely busy, you will have to wait and your services are good, but much better during the week.  that being said they like to take their time during the week.  sometimes its helpful to let them know you have a bit of a time crunch.  (my last gel manicure and pedicure i was there for just over 90 minutes)  i appreciated the time and enjoyed the break, but i know sometimes that much time is too much to spare.",1,1
Very impressed... Hannah did a great job.  I love the disposable liners for pedicures.  The only drawback was that I had to wait about 35 minutes for the appointment I made in advance.. But I would certainly recommend!,1,1
Had an absolutely wonderful experience here this past weekend! Steven was in town and did not nails with a gel manicure. He did a great job and took his time.. I did not feel rushed one bit. This will be my new favorite place to go.,1,1
Steven is the best here. He listens and does what you ask. No sharp square nails here. He does a great French pedicure. The price is great can't beat it.,1,1
"I'm only in Phoenix visiting, and this salon is by far one of the best I have seen. I wish I lived here so I could come get my nails done here more often. They have complimentary coffee and tea at the entrance :) They have great service too! Ask for Kim or Steven to do your nails!",1,1
Awesome price of $25 for a gel mani. Lots of OPI gel colors too! Everyone is really nice and takes their time. My favorite place :),1,1
Salon is trendy and certainly FANCY! Pedicure includes a wonderful and lengthy foot and leg massage. Hundreds of nail polish color options and competitive pricing. I'll be back!,1,1
"I recently moved to this salon after 5 years somewhere else that was close by. This salon is great. Great prices, very clean and great service. The techs dont sit on their phone the entire time you are there :) I will be ditching the other salon and using this place from now on! Great find. Highly recommend!",1,1
"Still getting great service several years later! I've never have a bad experience here, even when they are packed with customers. To those that are especially particular or love a more pampering experience and for the tech to take more time with them, try going during the week and during the day. If you like extra pampering, why would you go at the busiest time? It's common sense to go when they don't have a lot of other people to distract them and common sense to not go at the end of the day when they are exhausted and ready to go home, especially if you are a walk-in. That is with ANY business.   Their busy time, btw, is weekends, especially late in the day.",1,1
"I love this place! They give great services for the price. I got a mani and a pedi there and they were by far the cheapest, and the cleanest!! They take care of their clients. The best part, is they rememer you! it had been a while since I went there and they mentioned that to me. I will definately be going back there!",1,1
"First time at Fancy today. Walk-in appointment and I got sat immediately with Ha. She was very good! Very clean and quick technique. The salon is very nice and welcoming...they offer coffee, water, etc. I recently moved to the area and will definitely be back!!",1,1
"I often travel to Phoenix, but I've never been able to find a great nail salon that's the trifecta: clean, reasonably priced, and does great shellac...until now.   I called to check to see if I could come in without an appointment and was able to get in right away. I was greeted by the salon owner, who removed my old shellac and then prepped my nails. His next appointment arrived, so he sent me over to HaLee, who did my nails. She was awesome - precision shellac, super-nice, and very quick!   The salon is very clean and tastefully decorated. The cost of the manicure was very reasonable, considering what nearby salons were trying to charge.   I'll definitely visit again! Very happy.",1,1
"Im a regular at fancy nails, I just love their staff and service.  They just moved the salon a few doors down to a bigger spot, which has better air ventilation(no nail odor).  I usually come with a big party because they have plenty of room to accommodate us all.  I get SNS and a pedicure which last me about three weeks.  Highly recommend this salon.",1,1
Best Salon ever! I'm so sad to be moving soon and I will miss David and Steven terribly.,1,1
"Since I moved to Phoenix, I've happily driven 18 miles (one way) to have my nails done here.  Definitely the cleanest nail salon I've ever seen.  I like that they use disposable liners in the pedicure tubs.  Amazing colors of gel and regular polish.  Friendly and detailed staff.  Wish I could give 10 stars.  Very reasonably priced.",1,1
"Been coming to Fancy Nails for a few months. The place is very nice offering a number of features that give it an edge-nice decor, curtains separating some of the pedi chairs, a Keurig machine with coffee. Pedicures are relaxing and thorough. Very skilled nail technicians with both gel and acrylic. Got a nice bottle of lotion as a thank you Christmas gift last month. My new nail place!",1,1
Best & cleanest nail shop in Northeast Phoenix!  David & his nail techs have the latest colors!  Try the mood gel polish!  Changes color in cold or with water!  They have liners in tubs and keep everything very clean!  You will love it here! Thanks David & awesome nail techs!,1,1
"Fancy Nails is a great place to go when you are in a rush and need your nails done.  Firstly when you walk in they assist you right away, and soon enough your in your seat.  Let's say you got gels they would check every coat before putting it in the light. And they turn out perfect!  They also have a great coffee machine and water.  The people are super nice and great at what they do. It is also a very clean shop which has super comfy chairs washed supplies and the nicest polishes. So be sure to go to Fancy Nails, the nicest and neatest nail salon on earth!",1,1
Overall great experience Everytime I have been in here. Weekends get slammed so if you want a longer massage and more time spent then you need to go in during the week. Very consistent in here as far as cleanliness and service. Always a great idea to call ahead and let them know you are coming to make sure there isn't a wait.,1,1
"I've been here four times and each time was relaxing. Its quiet, does great work, and I'm going back again next weekend.",1,1
Holly is amazing I've been seeing her for years. She always helps me with my ingrown toe nail and she does an amazing massage. She cares with much detail. Best massage chairs in town. Great owner. This is my monthly stop !! :),1,1
"I'm normally not a girly girl so nail salons don't really interests me but I was on vacation with my chica and decided what the hell, why not? So this review is from not your typical girl who gets their nails done routinely. I probably do it once every few years lol. Upon arrival, this nail salon looks very fancy and clean. Their tools I think are packaged and their prices are pretty standard. This place is also the 1st time in my life to get my nails done by a guy 0.0 I think the techs there are nice and friendly and they explained to me any questions I had like what is difference between gel manicure and regular ones. I believe there is a pretty big selection of colors to choose. Since I'm not an expert, check out my pics and see for yourself! :)  Also, they provide free coffee and candy. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because my legs became a mosquito buffet but it's not their fault and it's pretty cool there with ceiling fans turned on.",1,1
"Very nice girls, clean salon and quick service.  If you pay with cash, you get a 5% discount. If you pay with debit, you can't add a tip to the charge, so be sure to bring cash.   I counted 17 people working today, very busy on the weekend, I dropped in with no appointment and got right in, 1 hour later, fresh mani/pedi in Lincoln Park After Dark (my favorite color).  Go here!",1,1
"Went on a whim while running errands and I was helped right away. The salon was very clean and the chairs comfy. The staff was friendly and though it was busy it was fairly quiet so I felt I could relax. basic mani/pedi for $34, not too bad! Will be visiting again!",1,1
"This place is absolutely FANTASTIC!!  I did not have an appointment, but they got me in right away.  I had a full mani-pedi and an absolutely thrilled with the results.  I believe it was Jessica and David who helped me and they were both friendly as can be.  Hannah also was great.  I definitely recommend this place!!",1,1
"Love this salon. Kim is very friendly and did a really nice job on my mani and pedi. The owner runs a very tight ship and not very many people are talking, it's very quiet, the staff are very attentive and it's very relaxing. The place is very very clean. I will make this my nail salon now, it's reasonable, friendly, clean and relaxing, what more could you want?",1,1
"Lovely ambiance Attentive staff Reasonable prices They use disposable liners for their foot spas, which lessen the risk of catching bacterial infection. Everyone is great, my favorite is Lynn. She is super talented!",1,1
"Needed a new nail place closer to my house so went here on a whim. I went on a wed afternoon so was pretty quiet and they were able to get me in right away. Pedicure was very nice, massage was long, they offered me a bottle of water, normal prices, clean place, and friendly staff. My only complaint was they didn't have me sit under the lamp to dry so after I got home I noticed one if my toes was smeared. Luckily I brought my own polish so I could touch it up. I will be going here again.",1,1
Just found this little gem!   We both had fabulous paraffin spa pedicures with hot stone massage. Very nice!!!  Hanna did a fabulous job on my powder mani!   Everyone was super personable and the shop is beautiful and spotlessly clean... they are opening the new shop in four weeks and the pictures David showed us are OVER THE TOP!!!  We will definitely be back... this is our new spot!,1,1
"Love this nail salon! They are clean, friendly and my mani/pedis always look awesome. I even took my 5 year old niece last time and they were so great with her!  Don't forget to bring cash!",1,1
"I've been going to Fancy Nails since I moved to PHX in July of last year based on the Yelp* reviews and have never been disappointed.  This is the first salon I have been to in a long time where I don't have a specific technician work on my nails.  Every person in the salon does a great job.  I am fortunate to be out of work before 3pm during the week so I can get to Fancy Nails by about 3:15...I've never had to wait for a service when I arrive around that time.  I have been on weekends and it does get busy, so I'd recommend you make an appointment.  The salon stocks OPI shellac/gel polish in addition to some other brands I don't recognize. A gel manicure costs $25. For all of my pedicure people, Fancy Nails uses disposable pedi tub inserts so no worries about someone else's foot funk touching your tootsies (big plus)!  They have a few options for pedicures, so ask to see the menu before you start.  They also offer waxing services and tanning as well but I can't comment on them since I've never used them. The salon is clean, well stocked, and everyone is always professional and courteous.  There are plenty of other nail salons closer to where I live but I choose to come to Fancy Nails.  They're everything I was looking for in a nail salon!",1,1
Thank you yelpers!! I found also found this place to be awesome!! Clean and lots of gel colors and glitter to choose from. Ill be back there for sure!!,1,1
This was my 1st time at Fancy. I took a chance coming in on a friday w/o an appt but was greeted and seated right away. I met Hannah and she did a gel manicure. Very sweet and friendly. She was quick and did a great job. Another girl did my pedi and I was happy with that as well. The place was nice looking and clean and I liked the service. Prices were fair and I will def be back!,1,1
Best nail salon I've been to in the Valley. I never have to wait. I don't ask for anyone in particular because every person who has done my nails has been fabulous. The polish lasts for longer than any salon I've been to. Love this place!!,1,1
"This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech.  They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!",1,1
Got a fill here about three weeks ago and my nails still look great!! Hannah did a great job and I will be back for sure!!!,1,1
"This place is worth every penny, everyone is friendly and professional and they do great work every time, consistency is everything! I live an hour from this place and it always puts a smile on my face walking out.",1,1
Amazing place downtown Oakville that makes you feel very welcome and has a downtown Toronto feel.  It's open a bit later than other places in Oakville therefore it's great for the night owl crowd. I've been there at least 3 times and there is usually some party going on.  Later in the evening they play music and have the most interesting Japanese Anime or Sumo wrestling on a big screen.   The food is authentic and high quality.  Their rolls are amazing.   But what makes this restaurant such a hit is the personal staff and bartenders who make everyone feel like a regular.  They greet everyone in Japanese.  I'll be back!,1,1
"What a gem! I'm so happy I wandered into FIn!   Since moving to Oakville I've been searching for as many Toronto-esque restaurants as possible so i can get my fill! I've found a few great places there, but no food (especially Asian) has actually been that great - until Fin!   I went here on a Sunday evening, and was concerned it wouldn't be open, but it was until 10 PM. We were greeted in Japanese and seated immediately by our extremely friendly and attentive server.   Food is a bit on the pricey side, but without there being much competition in terms of Izakaya in Oakville, I wasn't surprised, and it didn't break the bank.   Personal favorites were the selection of fish for three (see picture, so beautiful!) and the Eastern Style Caesar (who wouldn't love a drink with a crab leg in it!).  Overall i was super impressed with the quality and variety of food, as well as the service. I couldn't recommend Fin enough to those starved for a bit of Asian food in Oakville!  Disclaimer: If you're from Toronto and eat Izakaya all the time, this might be a touch pricey for you!",1,1
"Exceeded expectations. Ate early around 6.15 pm so was fairly quiet...2 others. Strangely asked if we had reservations...interesting!  Sauvignon Blanc from Chile was good and can be recommended. Cucumber Addiction tasty, avocado tempura very good, sashimi 3 kinds flawless, fresh raspberry point fresh oysters excellent value at $1.50 each. Shichimi duck salad also very good.  At $76 before HST & tip about right for the quality. Pleasant staff....will go again!",1,1
"Fairly new establishment on the Lakeshore strip in downtown Oakville.  A good thing to see with all the For Lease signs that have been cropping up lately.  If someone could translate what is yelled at patrons once they enter, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'll assume it is a greeting.  The friendly staff that helped us explained that the general restaurant experience is that of arriving, eating and then leaving to go enjoy something else, somewhere else.  The Izakaya experience is designed for you to eat, drink, socialize, etc. all under one roof.  Hence the loud and sometimes frantic atmosphere.  Pretty much a tapas menu.  After perusing the Sake menu, my wife and I settled on some Sapporo, mine in the bath-sized glass.  It wasn't that the Sake menu wasn't impressive, but my wife doesn't love it, I have limited experience with the Gekkeikan brand and I just wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a 3 oz, $15-30 sake that I may or may not like.  Maybe if I'd have been encouraged or had some sort of crash course I would have considered.  Any way, food:  In absence of a bread basket, you are given what is called thin spaghetti, coated in salt and flavoured with a spicy curry.  A little strange a different as it is like eating spicy uncooked spaghetti.    Started with the Cucumber Addiction - sliced pickled cucumber with sesame seed and oil.  A great clean-tasting starter.  All orders come out fast and furious, but staggered so as not to bung up the table too much.  The Pork Rib Kakuni was really good.  3 fall off the bone pork ribs that are slow braised and served on mashed potato with a spicy mustard for more flavour.  This was really tasty and a good portion of meat for only 3 pork ribs.  The Soy Bean Cream Crab Croquette is a mouthful.  Resembling arancini balls, but stuffed with crab, there 3 little guys are filling and have more substance to them than your average crab dish.  The Tuna Carpaccio is delicious with a savoury mixture coating the fish.  A little tricky to pick up with the chop sticks, as it is chopped rather finely, but worth the effort.  The Deep Fried Prawns are quite massive and heavy on the garlic, but the spicy sauce make 'em quite a lovely plate and pretty to look at once delivered.  As the evening progresses, more and more residents of Oakville filter in.  There is a lot of bumping and jockeying for room in this narrow little space.  Conversations can be heard from basically every table.  The fake-chested table were amazed when Barbie's shorter sister came in, no less than one month after giving birth and back to her fighting weight.  A quick cat walk, a twirl and they're sat beside us.  Yaaaaay.  This is where service fell apart.  We had one more order coming and we were contemplating another round of drinks and possibly dessert.  But with all the air-kissing going on and the place getting louder and packed, the person taking our orders came back to our table after 15-20 minutes, stating that he'd forgotten to enter our last dish.  Another 20 minutes later and the special of the night Cod we'd ordered arrived.  It was incredible and naturally buttery.  Any aggressive thoughts were forgotten instantaneously.   Food for Thought:  if you come for the special catches of the day, come early.  4 of the 6 fish specials were sold out by 7:30.  And the Blowtorch Mackerel?  It may be delicious but smells of burnt arm hair.  Maybe its just me and my wacky palette.  Hopefully the ""trendiness"" wears off in the passing months.  The food is quite good and staff are helpful, sincere and very knowledgeable with the menu.  It is the clientelle that I could do without.",1,1
Demi Colored my Hair yesterday and WOW! It's just what i wanted. I have been looking to do a soft ombre and she did it to perfection. I was bleach blond when i came in and left with a more natural looking blond!,1,1
Finally a person who can cut my hair the way I like it.  Anthony cut my hair and Demi did my color ...  always comes out perfect!!  I would recommend Theory Hair Design to anyone looking for a great cut.  Thanks!!!,1,1
"I've been seeing Anthony for 12 years or so and have followed him and Demi from Toni and Guy to here. I can't say enough about their skills - they're the only people I trust with my hair. I have dark brown hair that many people have failed to lighten to blonde without it turning a hideous shade of orange and/or getting severely damaged. Demi has not only saved my hair from damage, but always takes my hair to the perfect shade of blonde. Before seeing them, I was told by someone at Regis that it wasn't possible for me to be blonde. Here I am, 12 years later, blonder than ever  Thank you Demi and Anthony for saving my hair. They're an amazing team!",1,1
Amazing team!   Great hair by Demi and Anthony .  I would Highly recommend for great color and cut...,1,1
"My fiance and I really liked this place. Huge step up from Stonepepper Grill. Our server was very attentive and the food was quick and on point. Tried the bruschetta, chicken parm and cajun salmon. Every dish was good and the chicken parm was better than many spots in the area. The one negative was the hostesses attitudes. They seemed stressed and frustrated that they were busy at 7pm in a Friday night which should make them happy, right?",1,1
"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably.  I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back.  Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews.  A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92!  Well with it.",1,1
"Came here trying a new place. Literally! Just opened two days ago and well worth it! Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess, and we're told we could even have a seat in the bar. Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes.  We ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there.  The bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+ The salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B Next our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a ""back-of-the-throat"" heat which is perfect. So: ""A"" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying!  Overall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference.  I highly recommend coming here to try it out! Great ambience and extensive menu.",1,1
"We loved our experience here tonight.  Kim was our waitress and she was great.  Our children have an allergenic disease and are very limited in what they can eat.  I also have Celiac's disease, so no gluten for me.  Our meals came out just right, they made special accommodations for the kids and even had gluten free breadsticks they could eat.  You have now become one of our new favorite restaurants.",1,1
"Great food!  Thoroughly impressed with bolognese, manicotti, and veal.  Meatballs were soft and plenty of flavor. Sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but still good. Service needs tightened up, but they're still new.",1,1
"I don't understand the 2 star reviews. Lunch today was very good, especially the thin crust pizza and the wedding soup was superb.",1,1
"We had a great experience for dinner a few days ago! The service was wonderful and our server was very knowlegeable about the menu. I am gluten free and my daughter is egg and dairy free and she was able to guide us to the best choices. The kitchen appears to be careful about food allergies and cross contaimination. From our zucchini appitizer, family style salad, entrees and wine, everything was beautifully presented and tasted great. The courses were well paced and we had plenty of time to enjoy the warm,remodeled space with tables with white tableclothes. We will be back!",1,1
"You're not going to find Nihari and Biryani at this spot. It's American food made with a ""desi"" twist.   Stepping into this place, it's an enigma wrapped in an enigma. Sholay isn't heavily advertised in your face so you don't know what to expect.   The restaurant name brings memories of the legendary movie and elite characters. Come on. Don't tell me you can't hear Amjad Khan's voice :)   Enough of me being Basanti . The place has: a large poster of Shah Rukh Khan, a pic of the Dalai Lama , and generic scenery pics. As you walk in you are promptly greeted by two American white people. The instinct as a desi is to run away but please resist this urge.   You find out the staff, are owners and chefs who love desi food. The ""white dude"" who is their head chef, couldn't be more ""desi"" when it comes to spices and food.   Loved the chicken wings and chicken kabob here.   Only con: they are only open till 7pm.",1,1
"Not sure why my lamb kabob meal took so long to be ready, but I overheard something about the rice still cooking, and this was at peak lunch hour (noon)! My only complaint (almost 20 minutes for one to-go order with only 2 or 3 other customers at the time) was the waiting, but the employees were nice and made sure to let me know that I wasn't forgotten.  The shish kabobs were tender and savory, and their balsamic vinaigrette for my salad was the best I've ever had!!!  The saffron rice was also delicious even though it appeared to be the item that was delaying my order.   I should've called ahead, but next time, I want to try their lamb burgers...  Limited menu but top quality ingredients, yummm!  3/12/14 I returned there after work to pick up my lamb burger and side salad to go.  The ground lamb meat was indeed tasty, but I was disappointed by the smallish size compared to the bun.  I'll stick with the kabobs and rice in the future.  I was told by the nice man behind the counter that they'll be expanding the Indian portion of the menu in a few months so here's hoping they add samosas!",1,1
"Their burgers are so juicy and flavorful. Also greatly priced, and did I mention the burgers! I only tried a beef burger but the chicken looked so good! Te service was great with friendly staff. Definitely must try again!",1,1
"Fresh food... exotic flavors.  Their tag line says it all!  I ordered the beef kabob on the recommendation of Phil, the owner, and I was not disappointed at all.  The halal meat was moist and spiced just right... absolutely delicious!  The basmati rice was also spiced in a subtle way that complemented the meat.  He brought me a sample of the rice pudding, and it was very good, along with the mango yogurt smoothie, which would be a refreshing drink come the hot days of summer.  I cannot wait to go back and try some of the other items that other Yelpers have raved about!",1,1
"The friendliest worker ever works here. I think he is the owner, or just a very friendly man. Every time my boyfriend and I come here we get free stuff. Last time it was dessert, the other time it was mango lassi. The food is good and decent pricing. Sure, it's not the most glamorous presentations, but it is good for someone who is very hungry.  This place just opened up like a 3 months ago, so they are pretty eager to get customers in.",1,1
"Absolutely #Loving this place is. Scottish Mussels w/garlic, shallots, cream wow! Pan fried cod w/ asparagus, languostinemushroom sauce on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes #ToDieFor #KidFriendly - so welcoming to kids even later night! Ps side salad so fresh and tasty lots of feta and the mushroom pate appetizer #FAbulous",1,1
"Popped in to meet a friend for lunch.  Looked very ordinary on the outside, but the food was top notch.   My husband had the best steak he's had this trip here.  Cooked perfectly and delicious!!  I had a seafood curry that was also fantastic. Friendly, helpful waitstaff.  Great experience.",1,1
"Mouth is watering at the thought, this was the best meal I have had in a very long time, staff were pleasant enough. Muscles were huge, so tasty and very well cooked, the basket of bread was replaced a few times. Will be back soon :)",1,1
"This place is really good, but a little pricy I think. Although they do have some drink specials and a pot of mussels for about 13-15 pounds. But once you start ordering appetizers or any of the other entrees, it can get pretty pricey pretty fast. I didn't think the mussels were anything out of the ordinary really -- and I was surprised to find cilantro all over mine (usually it's parsley when you order a shallot, butter, and white wine sauce). This wasn't on the menu so I had to try and pick the cilantro out. The one must-order here though I would say is the grilled scallops with butter appetizer. It's juicy, buttery, slightly sweet scallops on the shell -- and probably my favorite thing here.",1,1
"I ordered mussels with ginger/lime sauce and they were the best I have ever eaten. For Â£12.50, the portion was huge (may be 30 or more) and the sauce was more like soup at the bottom. It was spicy and delicious.",1,1
"it's been a while since I've posted anything to yelp - but I noticed a distinct lack of available info during my travels to Scotland and Ireland, so here goes  This place is located at the (end of the) Grassmarket in Edinburgh - from what the guide books tell me, it would have had a great view of all the hangings (puir man got hangit) that took place there. The inside is modest but nice and aside from the somewhat crabbit (maybe German?) bartender, the service was just fine.  We split a bucket of mussels (shallot cream white wine sauce) and I had an 8oz ribeye - the husband had something weird like pasta.  The mussels were the best I've had in my life, truly amazing, and the steak, skinny little thing that it was, was delicious also.  The quality of the local beef and seafood spoke volumes - no extravagant preparations or sauces required.  Highly recommend.",1,1
"I went to The Mussel and Steak Bar after a date at the nearby BrewDog. The date was going well (oh la la) so he suggested stopping by this place for dinner. It was a Friday around 730 and we didn't have reservations, but we were able to be seated for a table for two. The manager was cheeky and ribbed my date a little bit for pretending to look in the reservation book to pretend to be someone else, which was very amusing. We were able to sit upstairs and I thought the place had lovely ambience.   We started with some fried goat cheese balls and garlic grilled mussels. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of mussels but I thought ""When in Rome!"" and tried them. They were really tasty, but I'm not sure garlic was the best date choice! Anyway, for my main I had a special fried plaice with black pudding mash that was extremely tasty. My date had a steak that he enjoyed. Topped off with a nice glass of house white and I was a happy camper. I will definitely come back to The Mussel and Steak for another nice dinner in the future when I'm in the area, which of course I will be because I do love BrewDog...",1,1
"We had a light dinner here, it was fantastic! Fresh seafood at it's finest. Started out with Arran Smoked Salmon with Potato Scones, CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che and Chives, the salmon was so fresh, it melted in your mouth. We also split a kg of the Scottish Mussels, we chose Shallots, White Wine, Garlic & Cream sauce, don't forget to order some bread to dip into the pot and soak up the goodness. This was probably one of the best mussels pots I've had.   Call and make a reservation if you can, we waited 45 minutes for a table (we went over to the Bow Bar to pass the time). If you can, sit outside, great people watching, right in the heart of Grassmarket.",1,1
"The best surf and turf I have ever had.   I stumbled upon this place by accident during a day trip to Edinburgh. It was during Scotland's unexpected (and sorely missed) heatwave so we sat outside - a rare treat in our climate. We were the first diners when we sat down but by the time we left the place was full and there was a great vibe.   Now to the food. Me and my dad both opted for the same thing - the surf and turf. This consists of a Rib Eye Steak served with half a kilogram of mussels cooked in your choice of sauce, crevettes and squid rings. Being a big fan of Asian flavours I opted for the chilli, ginger and lime sauce. We also ordered some buttered new potatoes on the side to add some carbohydrate to all the protein.  When the dish arrived it was amazing. Perfectly cooked steak (medium-rare for me) sitting on a mountain of seafood - not many things could look so appealing. All the seafood was full of flavour, the sauce had just enough heat and the Corona with lime just added to an amazing meal.  Next time I'm in Edinburgh I will definitely be making a return here (I hope the heatwave will too).",1,1
I went there for a casual lunch date with my SO. It is lovely. They have a pretty reasonable lunch and even dinner deal if you want to fine dine on a budget.   I had the steak and it was great! So good and nicely flavored and cooked just right. The mussels are great! They have a Thai inspired flavor which is not bad if you want something different.   I do recommend getting the French fries fries in beef jus. It's good and so much better than their plain potatoes.,1,1
"I'd recommend any seafood lover to go to the Mussels and Steaks Bar.  Excellent food, great service and located in a bustling part of town. The decor is basic but the great tasting fresh food and friendly service more then made up for it.    All the food was fresh, vibrant and flavorful.  Our group tried the seafood platter, the special lobster dish, curry mussels and the surf and turf combinations.  No one had a complaint about any of the dishes.  The best part was the double fried chips in drippings.",1,1
"This is a gem in an otherwise touristy Grassmarket. This place has fantastic food, Oysters, Fish, Steak, and plenty of other options. But the specialty has to be the mussels. Choose a mussel pot and have it in any of five ways to suit your palate and mood, just take your pick. Depending on how hungry you are choose a full three course, or share a divine starter and dessert. All this with great service, good price and fresh atmosphere.",1,1
"Fantastic seafood, with a wide menu selection. Staff are friendly, eager to please and not afraid to make an honest recommendation or suggestion. The restaurant is generally busy, mostly down to it's great reputation and location. The prices are reasonable given the quality and quantity. Also great at dealing with larger groups of dinners so a good place to book a special family meal",1,1
"I come here. A lot. Either with my mum or with friends (usually to celebrate a birthday) this has become a personal favourite eating place.   Firstly, it does good food- whether you are into seafood or meat. You get to watch your food being cooked on a screen (which is slightly odd) and I love the layout of the ground floor- quite modern without over doing it. Look out for the fun facts about mussels in the toilets.  The service has always been super friendly at this place. Being in such a prime location I was expecting shocking prices but I was pleasantly surprised. They have amazing lunch deals and I have never walked out of this place hungry.  Sadly they only have one vegetarian option as far as mains courses go. Also, in the winter the upstairs floor tends to get really warm.   Aside of these hitches Mussels and Steak Bar is a good standard for me.",1,1
AMAZING! Went at tea time on Monday night and couldnt have left fuller or happier :) Waiting staff are very very attentive and friendly. I had smoked salmon salad for starters and mussels in white wine and garlic for main and it was superb. It is a wee bit more expensive than other places but I would say its definately worth it. Food served very fast as well.,1,1
"Everybody in my family likes something different. My Dad likes Italian, my Mum French, myself Indian and my sister Chinese. The problems it causes when we each want our restaurant to provide something different. As a comprimise, we often decide that a restaurant serving British food is the best option - but then its time for the real battle to begin. Light and fresh sea food or good and hearty steaks?  It seems then that I should introduce them to Mussels and Steak Bar - which, as you would expect, serves Mussels and Steak.  Its no secret in the restaurant that the produce is local (or at least Scottish) and the ingenious menu combines seafood and heavy meats in brilliantly tasty ways. The sauces used are outstanding, if a bit 'out there' and incredably mouthwatering (In fact my mouth is watering as I type).  The restaurant itself is simple and practicle - and despite the annoying big screen TV's - has a seaside town feel to it,matching the down to earth cooking style. The staff are friendly and helpful, while the bar offers a large range of drinks.  So there you have it, a restaurant which can cater for all appitites and in a mouthwateringly excellent way.",1,1
"We were in for the Edinburgh Festival and saw our favorite tapas place replaced by Mussels and Steak.   The atmosphere looked a little cold and modern but the menu was interesting.   In a word, the mussels were terrific! We tried the bacon and cream. Plump mussels, huge pot, delicious.  Our scallop starter was equally good. The steak was fine but next time we are just doing mussels. This is really their thing.  Not five stars as they just opened (second location) and fumbled a bit with forgetfulness and delays.  The staff and owner were very friendly and apologetic. Highly recommended  .",1,1
"I don't like mussels.  They are too strong and too fishy! Don't care for the smell and don't care for them in soups or stews.  Until now I would have told you that I'd rather eat rattlesnake.  Appearantly in Scottland, there is an entirely different species of mussels.  We stopped in at the Mussel and Steak Bar for dinner before walking up to the castle for the 10:30 Tattoo.  Our travel mate ordered the mussel starter.  It arrived with green sauce on it.  OMG, it smelled amazing.  So much so that I had to taste it.  The little mussels were tender and steamed to perfection with a light pesto sauce driselled over them.  It is such a great combination!  I had the surf and turf for dinner.  The mussels were done in white wine and garlic and the ribeye steak was tender, juicey and cooked exactly as I ordered it. All four of us agreed that our meals were delightful.  The price was not out of line.  Service was spot on.",1,1
"On our last day in Edinburgh, I still hadn't tried Haggis.  And I really wanted to try it.  The waitresses we excited to watch me try it for the first time, they were chatty but not overly.  They were attentive, but not overly.  I had a good time, but next time I'd like to take my time and order more and stay longer.",1,1
"An excellent experience - all of the food was of a high quality, as was the service..  Whether it was scallops, mussels, oysters or plaice, the seafood was first class and as fresh as the sea itself.  Steaks were also delicious, both ribeye and sirloin.  The wine choices worked well with the food and the choice of whiskies suited our need to try something different.   Staff were terrific. Attentive, friendly and showing real concern for our table.  We will be back.",1,1
"I went here for the langoustines, and they did not disappoint.  They were nicely cooked and flavored with garlic butter.  The main course of mussels came with at least 30, and they were delicious as well (we had the chili seasoning). Others in our group had steaks that were nicely cooked (medium rare) and tasty--great chips, too. Our waiter was a bit casual with the service, but the other wait staff picked up the slack.  Overall, it was an excellent Edinburgh meal, with ingredients that featured the best that Scotland has to offer.",1,1
Very easy to find. Seafood place with reasonable price. We enjoyed both the mussel and steak :),1,1
"One of the best spots for seafood in Edinburgh, and one of my favorite restaurants in the world.   Located just across the street from a longer strip of restaurants and pubs in the Grassmarket, it would be possible to pass the Mussels Steak Bar without giving it a second thought. That would be a huge mistake.  I've made about 12 trips here for lunch and dinner, and every time I've always been greeted by an unbelievably friendly waiter or waitress. They start you off with some of the best crusty bread and softest whipped butter you'll ever taste, and they are happy to replenish it many times over.  My favorite way to start a meal is with a kilo pot of their mussels, which are all ridiculously fresh and delicious, particularly with the white wine, shallots, garlic and cream sauce. Both the steaks and the seafood pasta (with loads of mussels, scallops, prawns, and calamari) are excellent main courses, and their fries with 'beef dripping' are some of the best I've ever tasted. Their wine list is not huge but offers good selection at reasonable prices.   The meal can definitely run on the pricey end depending on the conversion rate (if you're an American) but I have never walked out of this place unsatisfied. Highly, highly recommended!",1,1
"Great steak, great mussels, and great cocktails. Fun vibe in a great neighborhood. Get the chips fried in beef drippings.",1,1
"Service was excellent!! The server was very attentive & accommodating. No one rushed or hurried us out even though we were the last to leave that night. Make reservations in advance if possible.  The Mussels were not bad although I had to order bread as it didn't come with bread. The scallops & bacon appetizer was a delicious combination. Yum! The Surf & Turf lobster tail & braised beef was my favorite entree and a big portion. The sirloin steak w/carrots & cauliflower was great. However, the mashed potatoes were not that flavorful.  Dessert - the chocolate mouse was good but the chocolate hazelnut (special of the day) was amazing! Must order this if you get the chance.",1,1
"Came for a late lunch and enjoyed great food, friendly service, and an overall excellent value. I recommend it.",1,1
"Our meal was stupendous! Got the surf and turf. Ribeye steak was juicy and cooked perfectly. The mussels were cooked in a whisky, bacon and cream sauce. OMG! Unbelievably delectable. Portion sizes were enormous. Smoked salmon duo for appetizer was just as good as the main course. Overall one of the best meals we had in Edinburgh.",1,1
Wow. This place was Sooooo good.  Oysters rib eye and cheesecake were all incredible. The side of mushrooms were also very good. The prices are great for what you get.,1,1
"Fantastic location but very small on the inside, can be a long wait.  The seafood was only slightly above average in freshness and quality, and small portions, so had to knock off one star.",1,1
"Wonderful steak, wonderful mussels, great value!    A great place for meat and fish lovers like me - I highly recommend.    Ess",1,1
"The other reviews are  surprising. The first surprise is that a reviewer is surprised to find that Scotland, the north part of Great Britain (a well known island), has decent seafood. The second, and more disturbing, is the complaint that a restaurant with the name ""Mussel and Steak Bar"" has a fairly short menu. One might have thought, nay expected, that the menu would be mainly ...  On a positive note, what I can say is that they provide first class food. What they say they do they do well. The steaks, in my experience, are meltingly tender. The chips (US: french fries) cooked in beef dripping are crisp and moreish.  The restaurant is good value because not a  morsel will be left on the plates.",1,1
Stopped for lunch and we weren't disappointed.   It was fantastic.  My wife had the mussel special and I had the hot seafood platter.  I watched them deliver a few of the Tomahawk specials and they looked incredible.  My only disappointment was that the hot seafood platter was mostly mussels and not very varied but still well done.   The outside look of this place does not represent the quality inside.  Service was great.,1,1
Stumbled upon this gem. An easy wLk off the Royal mile and below the castle. The mussels were tasty and the scallops were terrific. The cost was reasonable and the service was excellent.,1,1
"Very tasty food, great beer and really friendly service!!",1,1
"I never fail to enjoy a good feed at the Mussel and Steak Bar. Pot of mussels with white wine and garlic sauce does the job perfectly. The ambience is pleasant, but it's better to sit downstairs as the upstairs bit feels a bit empty and lonely I think.   Food is generally lovely. Staff are generally lovely. Place is generally lovely. Go!",1,1
Pool tables were in good condition and so were the sticks. Went on a Sunday and was charged $16/hour. It was a good experience and atmosphere overall.,1,1
"Enrolling my 3 kids into their Sat morning Chinese Prog. The facility is clean and well organized. They  seems to focus on academics, kids are grouped by level and not age.",1,1
"My child has attended this school for the last 9 months. Learning ABCs and math and chinese, playing outdoors and indoors.  The School has lots of different age students from when the child is potty trained to kids taking their SATs to adults learning Mandarin.  They even have water activities on weds and Fridays (weather permitting).    I am happy to drop off my kid to school. My kid has learn how to speak basic Mandarin.  There are lots of non asian children in school. Most teachers are bilangual. Lots of mixed asian children too.  The school is very focus on safety.  You need to be buzzed in to get into the building. Each parents sign in and sign out during pick up and drop off.  We (including my mom who is a former teacher) checked out three different pre kindergarten for my child and felt this was the best one.  We are happy we choice this school.",1,1
"Dedicated staff and a variety of teaching methods have helped with my daughter learn a lot in a short time.  I wish we had gotten her in here sooner. The staff has always listened to our feedback. I feel the school provides exactly what they promise, and would keep her here full time if they went past Kindergarten.",1,1
I really like this school for my son . He learn a lot  here and he looks forward to come . The teachers are great and the rest of the staff . Thank you Las Vegas Chinese school,1,1
"My kids have attended to this school for two years. The staffs and teachers are really helpful, especially to bilingual students. All teachers are fluent in Chinese and English. The school creates a great environment for kids to communicate and learn Chinese is a fun way. Besides education, the school always pays attention to students safety too. I love this school!",1,1
"The wife and I wanted to modernize our home theater system and clean up the cluttered look.  We chose three businesses on the west side of town to start with.  Elite A/V was the only business that could be bothered to qualify us as customers and after about an hour of talking A/V with Carmine and Jeremy we had three quotes THAT DAY!  I needed to convert my old ""tube"" TV niche so I could hang the plasma on the wall.  During this remodel project Elite A/V sent a team out to pull some new wired networking runs and they were able to complete this task in one day.  A couple of return visits to patch up the holes and you can't tell they were ever here!  The price was very reasonable and the job was finished quickly (much quicker than I expected) and professionally.  We had asked Carmine to give us three quotes and a budget cap to work with and when Carmine told us we would have quotes same day I originally thought that was a bit optimistic since we met with them later in the afternoon...but sure enough after dinner I had quotes in my inbox.  This is the kind of service we received from Elite A/V over and over, when they said they were going to do something they did it and always on time.  We decided to go with Martin Logan Eloctrostats and a Marantz receiver to replace our aging equipment and I will say it is impressive, the warmth, depth, and clarity is hard to imagine until you hear it.  This was an A++ purchase at a reasonable price and we are one hundred percent satisfied.  We are looking forward to our continued relationship with Elite A/V as their customer service and quality of service was unmatched by others we talked to during our remodel project.  Five Stars from Robert and Stephanie",1,1
"FRANK.......MY Hats off too Jeremy at Elite AV. Following a no show twice in 48 hrs. by one of his competiors. I had no choice but to grab the ball and run. I went on line and after about 15 min of reasearch I chose Elite AV. Within 45 min.  I had an Appointment set up for same day  installation. Wow was I lucky. Jeremy showed up right on time and 4 hrs later my install was completed. During the process there were recomendations made to meet my needs, I went with all sugestions. I must add not one recomendation was made that did not make financial sense to achieve my needs.He never tride to upsell me or his services. Thanks for the honesty. Jeremy and team will now service all of my  family and friends home theather/ security needs. Thanks young man...I wish you much sucess continue to do what your doing in the manner you are doing it dont loose focus, you cant miss. Frank....",1,1
"PLEASE use these guys!  This has been the best experience for us!  We found them on Yelp (thanks Yelp!) and from the very beginning they were on top of it.  They were fast, efficient, courteous, and clean.  But more importantly, they know what they are doing and are true experts in their field.  We shopped a few companies before choosing this one and on top of everything else, they beat the other companies price!  Very happy overall and will recommend them to everyone.",1,1
"NO MORE DEAD SPOTS!  Thanks to Elite AV putting in an awesome Wi-Fi system in my house, every corner of my house has an awesome Wi-Fi signal that works perfect. It's just like having a Wi-Fi system in an office building but in my home!! so it's absolutely the best of the best in Wi-Fi and I couldn't be happier with what they've done!! Not to mention the install and set up that they installed in my closet looks amazing!! Truly an amazing installation it's not like that crappy job that the cable man does when they come to your house, by having Elite AV install your system your getting a  professional custom install with the cooling fan system and rack all bolted to my walls exactly what you want you're home ! So you can only imagine how happy my houses when every TV in my house is streaming videos movies music and have no problem at all thank you elite AV for everything that you've done!! I recommend anybody who's looking for professional courteous awesome installation with great working Wi-Fi to use Elite AV !!",1,1
"I spent so much time reviewing projectors and screens that I never really thought about installation. I finally narrowed down my choice to Jeremy and his team and that turned out to be the best decision in the world! Jeremy came by to check out my loft and we brainstormed ideas for my home theater. He was very knowledgeable and left zero doubt in my mind that I'd picked the right company. Jeremy and his team got my projector ceiling mounted and my 110 inch screen up in no time. He threw in a video receiver and two ceiling mounted speakers to complete the perfect home theater for me and my family! He even installed a new outlet so I could hide the wires on my living room television when I asked last minute. That was icing on the cake that made a person like me who rarely writes, just reads reviews, make sure that I shared the experience I had with this company! A+ work",1,1
"From the initial meeting for a detailed quote with Carmine to the install and set up of my system with Jeremy (brilliant young man) and team. The experience was pleasant, great attention to detail and absolutely no damage to my home. The mess that was inevitable with any A/V install was meticulously cleaned up by the team.  This company strives to be the best and will work with you regardless of your budget. I will stress however if you are looking for a superior system do not skimp with inferior components.  True professionals and will spend the extra time to make sure you are completely satisfied with your system and truly understand the operation of your new system and control before leaving.   Definitely 5 stars, will definitely use this company again when the situation arises. And",1,1
"Thank you, Finally an audio / video specialist company you can trust and thats not creepy. I was't even planning on putting a home theater system for my house until i talked to Jeremy, who was highly recommended by a close friend. Long story short he stopped by my house we did a walk through together and he really took his time to explain the different possible options we had based on quality of the products and my budget. He wasn't pushy and made me feel real comfortable. Next day i received an amazingly priced estimate and decided i was going to do it. Him and an associate of his stopped by on the date we agreed on (on time) and knocked my whole home theater system out in less than 5 hours. What made my experience even better was the fact that he was more than willing to teach me how to use my brand new pioneer receiver. All and all they made my life a lot  more entertaining. I have to admit i did spent a bit more than i had initially planned but it was worth it. I will be calling them back for more stuff, highly A+++ recommended...",1,1
"I sent an email to Elite A/V LLC to see if they could give me an estimate to hook up a new blue ray, to an older home theater system and new tv.  They replied back to me within minutes saying it would probably be around $99.00 which I found acceptable and scheduled an appointment for the next day.  They arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the TV.   Since that was not a good option for me I declined and they were kind enough to not charge me for the service call.   I then thought about purchasing another home theater system but they suggested that I use the existing built in ceiling speakers.  I had originally not wanted to spend what I thought would be a lot of money to hook those up but after further discussions with Dylan I agreed this was the best route.   He was able to provide a receiver and sub-woofer for me or I could have went out and purchased my own.  I verified based on his quote and the cost was no more than what I would have paid at Best Buy.   We rescheduled for the next day for the install and again they were right on time.  Kevin and his partner came out and completed the installation in about 2  1/2 hours talking us through the whole process.  They had to cut a small hole in the back of the entertainment center so they could attach the wires which I was at first not crazy about but it was very small and behind a closed door so it was a non-issue.  The cost came to more than what I had intended to spend at the time but I am so glad that I went with their suggestion.  The sound is fantastic, I don't think we will ever go out to see movies again.  I would highly recommend Elite A/V LLC as I felt they were very honest in explaining our options and we did not feel pressured at all on the direction to go.",1,1
"I needed the surround system for my house set up.  Jeremy came in and evaluated the house.  He made suggestions.  Jeremy chose some great equipment that were the best bang for my buck.  He was willing to work around my schedule for everything.  Chris and Dillon came to install the equipment after the consultation.  They were ""somewhat"" professional.  No...they were great and easy to work with in the house.  They cleaned up after themselves and did a fantastic job.  Sometimes when strangers come into your house, it can become awkward.  In this case, we cracked jokes and were able to still maintain an efficient time frame.  They suggested some things for the future as well.  I would recommend them hands down for any work.  If all works out, I plan to use them for some automation.",1,1
Jeremy and his company have always done fantastic work for me. Anything I dream up he can accomplish. I have used his company for several years and would never trust anyone else. He is the best!,1,1
"I am as picky as they come for A/V ascetics and performance. Elite came and mounted my tv on then when we didn't like the height they changed it without hesitation. The most professional team. We got an A/V rack, custom remotes, and everything worked perfectly and it was top notch equipment.   We had them come a second time and the same performance. We had all the A/V companies come out for the bid and they don't hold a candle to Elite. Jeremy & Dylan are the best.",1,1
Dylan and the rest of the team are true professionals. They are very knowledgeable and worked quick; they did three plasma tv/ receiver/ blu ray set-ups in one day (and one of those involved installing speakers into the ceiling via my attic crawl space). I'm very happy with the results.,1,1
"Great experience!  Had 2 TVs and a sound bar installed.  Great quality work!  Jeremy, Dylan, and Chris are all very friendly and easy to work with.  Highly recommend them!",1,1
"I have worked with Jeremy at Elite A/V numerous times he is very particular clean and does excellent work. They do everything at 100%, never cut corners, very knowledgeable, polite, and honest. I recommend them to anyone!!",1,1
Just moved to town and my home theater system was still in moving boxes.  I needed help and am very happy that I reached Jeremy at Elite.  He arrived at the time promised and installed everything at a fair price.  He and Dylan were more than professional and answered all by questions.  When they were finished I was very pleased with my system and really noticed the improved sound with the suggestions that were made.  I would not hesitate to recommend Jeremy and his team to any one who has a need for AV service.,1,1
"Chris and Jeremy are great. They installed a 4 camera system (with ability to run 8 total) in my home after my wife wouldn't stop nagging. The system is real nice. They installed two flush mount screens (about size of smaller computer monitor) in both my bedroom and family room area. The screens turn on and off with a switch, and run a constant 4 screen split view of all my cameras. The whole camera thing is silly to me if you aren't able to view them in a moments time when someone rings the bell, or if you hear something strange. Sure, everyone's able to look on their phones - but the monitors they put in are amazing. Full HD quality, and great picture.   I had some minor issues with my first NVR. It would reset in the middle of the night, and when I woke up my screens in both living areas were reset. I called Chris and he was back the next day. It turned out there was a small update on the NVR that wasn't done prior to sending a small shipment of NVR's out.  A new one was sent via the manufacturer, and we had a new unit installed 3 days later.   Both very nice guys. Professional. Nice equipment. They take their shoes off. They pet the dog. All in all, good experience and have recommended them to a neighbor (after recent break-ins in the subdivision -- 3 in total).",1,1
"My Tech was Nestor, I had my new TV set up with receiver, 6 speaker surround sound, and my computer. Nestor was very knowledgeable, and his customer service was was excellent. The Gentleman who initially took my call (sorry I forgot his name) was also very knowledgeable, and professional. I will definitely recommend this company to anyone with A/V needs.",1,1
"Jeremy came to our house on time, took off his shoes (without being asked!), was incredibly patient and helpful (marked the buttons we need to push) as he reworked some things we tried to install. He also did quite a bit of troubleshooting and will be back to help us again (per our request) as we need him for more than just the first request (we had purchased a new receiver and couldn't seem to hook it up to the existing whole house speaker system). We now have music that plays through the house and it is wonderful (and precisely what we needed). Reasonable rates and someone we can trust to come back and help us with the next project.",1,1
Had multiple items installed in my office and I couldn't be happier with the service and the wonderful team. Will be doing more business with Jeremy and Elite A/V! If you have a chance to get services from them TAKE IT!!! You will be glad you did!!!,1,1
"I am highly satisfied with the work Jeremy and his associate did at my house. I mounted a tv and needed someone to run the cables through the wall. It was a relatively small job and I was wondering if I could even find someone to do it. Just like the other reviewers mention, Jeremy quickly and politely answered my email. Within a week he had come to my house once, on time, knowledgeable and prepared to complete the job. He tested everything out and cleaned up and the installation looks great! I will use Elite again and will recommend them as well.",1,1
"Called from reviews on Yelp and could not have been more professional. Upgraded a 15 year old home theater and Jeremy gave me everything and more within my budget. In addition, Dillon and his team did an amazing job with install. My theater is like new thanks to these guys. Don't buy from anyone else. Go directly to them and they will get you the right products and install within your budget.",1,1
"Jeremy and team did a fantastic job installing several new cameras and moving some A/V equipment from my existing entertainment center into a media room.  Everything is controlled with a single remote control.  The work was done in a timely manner and very clean.  That was my biggest fear...holes in walls, exposed wires, etc.  They ran all cables through the canned lights in the ceiling on the 1st floor of a 2 story house.  Very nice job.  Highly recommended.",1,1
"i used these guys through angie's list.. extremely satisfied with their work..  had a tv mounted and wires hidden behind 2 tv's..  they didnt try to ""overcharge' for the materials i needed from them.  (needed longer wires).  jeremy could do the work with his eyes closed.   they cleaned up everything after they were done...  will definitely use them again when i need.",1,1
These guys are the best!  So helpful and so on the ball.  They walked me through all of my options and let me pick the one that best fit me :)  I totally recommend this company!,1,1
"Ok, I just had one of the best customer service experiences in my life! I called Elite A/V after reading the yelp reviews.  I called because the picture on my smart TV would go black if I even moved the receiver a fraction of an inch. Also I couldn't get Netflix audio to play through my surround sound. I called the office around noon today and the technician, Dylan, was at my door at 4:00 pm. Dylan was as professional, courteous and knowledgeable as it gets. Within 10 minutes Dylan had run a new HDMI cable inside the wall, switched some connections and presto now Netflix audio was playing through my surround sound! All that was perfect but it got even better. I asked Dylan about television options outside of the cable companies. We talked about Roku for streaming various shows and channels. Dylan was kind enough to offer to come back another day and set me up with Roku at no extra charge (outside of the cost for the Roku itself) as he had only been there about 20 minutes out of the hour I was being charged. Well it turned out that Dylan had a new Roku in his truck and 30 minutes later Dylan had helped us set up an account and explained in detail how it worked. Dylan even loaded some free channels for us. I'm an older guy, in fact I think I have some socks older than Dylan but he was extremely patient and courteous in explaining everything. Now I can really reduce or even eliminate my Direct TV bill. Incredible!  Please use Elite A/V for any home theater needs you may have. I can't recommend them any higher and can't thank Dylan enough for his assistance.",1,1
They came to install a TV and a huge white board in our office. Jeremy was very friendly and was a pleasure to be around. We had great conversation as he was hanging the items in our office. They were in and out and didn't take long at all. They kept everything clean and provided coverage for the ground to ensure easy clean up! The office looks awesome! Called to make payment and they were super friendly.   Thanks Elite A/V LLC!,1,1
"I worked with Elite A/V to install sound system and surveillance cameras for commercial gym. Great experience. They made good recommendations, didn't try to screw me with equipment mark ups, and did quality work. A couple weeks after completing the job, I couldn't get a receiver to work right and they were still very responsive and came right over and fixed my problem. Professional and good value. I will definitely call them again for my next job.",1,1
These guys are great!  They mounted a 55 inch in a tough spot no problem. Highly recommended.,1,1
"I called 4 different places to get estimates for installing in ceiling speakers for a surround sound system. 2 of them were very high priced and out of my budget. It came down to Elite and another company. All of them were pleasant to speak to but Dylan with Elite really listened to me, worked with me on my budget and found something that I'm very satisfied with. I didn't need anything on the high end and had him install a 5.1 speaker system that fit right in my budget.   Dylan called me the day before to confirm our appointment and also called me about an hour before arriving as well. As a business owner and service provider this is a practice that I find invaluable to both the customer and the vendor. Upon arrival he took great care in covering up all my furniture and electronics to insure a clean and complete install.  He installed 8"" 5.1 speakers to my receiver for TV, Blu Ray and X Box which I absolutely love! He also hooked up my turntable. Everything was calibrated to my liking. Dylan even walked me through activating my sub-woofer which I accidentally shut off after he left. He also contacted me the next day to make sure I was satisfied. I appreciated his professional courtesy, work ethic and customer service. Great product and service at a great price installed by a customer service oriented company.",1,1
"I have to give it to these guys...they are awesome!  Being I was working on a tight budget and having older audio equipment, Elite came to the rescue.  I want to give a shout out to Dylan and Erik (along with his son), for the awesome job you all did for us.  They were all very professional and the end result is great!  Erik (and son) were thorough, explained things along the way and kept everything clean as they went.  I would definitely recommend Elite A/V to anyone interested in having their audio/video professionally hooked up.  Thanks again you guys, and keep up the good work.",1,1
"This Company is Amazing! I have worked with Jeremy & his Crew so many times. I cant get enough of these guys. TV's on the wall, speakers in the ceiling. They even got my PC set up as a Server so I can stream music & videos everywhere. Call them today or stop by their shop and say Hi!",1,1
"The Best Audio Video company I have ever experienced.   They are LICENSED, BONDED, INSURED.   These guys are Professional.  Jeremy took my call and had his crew come over the same day!  They diagnosed an existing custom home speaker system and mounted the TV's very quickly.  The team was prepared, clean and respectful.   They made sure they did not leave until the system worked perfect.  They checked all the TV/Blue Ray/DVR settings to make it work the way I wanted.  It is a large crew that can handle big or multiple jobs. Workmanship is really great.  The wires were run in the wall on both applications.  They have decades of experience!! Value: Their prices are very fair for the quality of work (Excellent)!  I highly recommend Elite A/V LLC.",1,1
"I used amazon services to get connected for the Elite A/V team to mount my TV. They did an awesome job. The Elite A/V team were amazing. They were professional and  courteous even removing the shoes upon entering the house and vacuuming a small amount of dust up when done. It was clear they took their time to measure everything out and assist in making suggestions on where to place the TV.  For any future AV or home automation, I'll definitely give these guys a call.",1,1
These guys are the best and they work fast too. They did a security camera install at our office and it came out just how we wanted. They were very fair with their estimate and did a great job in a timely manner. The camera system is awesome. I even have real time access from my iphone which they set up for me. (This is great when you want to see what your employees are doing while you're gone for lunch). Chris and Jeremy are both cool guys and will give it to you straight. I will use them again in the future.,1,1
Jeremy and Maurice came to our home on 6/24/14 to clean up a mess of wires for our home theater and internet system that have been that way for several years. We have paid other techs to do the same job but the wires were still left in a mess. This time we finally found someone who knows how to do the job right. Jeremy and Maurice are coming back in a few months to change out the ceiling speakers with new larger and directional speakers and have given us other options for updating our 7 year old system. If you have any TV or Sound system issues call Elite no job is too big or too small. Great company.,1,1
Great! I had been looking for a while for someone to mount my new television for me and everyone I found was either too pricey or just didn't seem professional enough. I spoke with Jeremy at Elite AV and he was kind enough to tell me over the phone which type of mounts I would need as well as what he sold in comparison to the retail stores. I trusted him merely from this phone call and when he came a few days later for an installation I knew I made the right choice! Very professional and very knowledgeable!!  Thanks Jeremy!,1,1
"Jeremy was originally going to stop by and give me an estimate then he went ahead and mounted two tvs for me on the spot. He's very professional , competitively priced, and knows his stuff. I plan on using his company for my home theater installation as well once he finalizes the estimate.",1,1
"I got a great deal on a high end 12 camera security system but needed someone to the install and found Elite A/V LLC on Angies.  I messaged them and Jeremy replied within 24 hours and we made an appointment for a walk around. Our place is single story with a large foot print at 3600 sq ft and I wanted full perimeter and entry coverage. We have vaulted ceilings in over half of the house, with very little attic space on that half so running cables is no walk in the park.  Jeremy and his crew were always very polite and professional and I am very happy with the work they did,  They did all the camera cabling, setup the dvr and did some upgrades to our 2gig alarm system. I feel I got a very fair price on the work that was done.  I plan on adding 4 more cameras down the line and will definitely use them again.",1,1
"Decided to get a new 55"" TV installed in our bedroom and did a service request online on Sunday and woke up to the owners response on Monday morning that they would try to get to us the same day! The techs called at 8 am to let me know they would be there at 10 and they were actually there on time ready to rock with tools in hand. This really impressed me as most companies want to see the job and try the up sell dance 1st before unloading a thing from their truck! These guys knew they were there to work and were prepared to do just that! They were very neat and meticulous and got the TV up and running in no time. They explained everything and took the time to answer all of my questions. I would highly recommend Elite A/V to handle any of your audio video and home automation needs!! Thanks Jeremy and crew!!",1,1
"Very very pleased, Jeremy is very knowledgeable and they know their product well.  Also, his crew was really nice every time when they came out to install their equipment.  This company is completely professional, responsive, and attentive.  I was so pleased that when they finished their job everyone cleaned up, and did not leave a mess.",1,1
"Been using Jeremy and his guys for some time now, very professional and very honest. Will be using him again very soon when I move into my new house. Highly recommended!",1,1
"I had to take a moment and brag on Jeremy!  He is the MAN!  His prices were very reasonable.  He and his staff were quite professional and we punctual, I would definitely recommend him if you want a professionally installed system!",1,1
Absolutely Fantastic.  Jeremy was not only on time and friendly but the guy really knows his stuff.  He went the extra mile but didn't nickle and dime me over everything.  I'll definitely be telling everyone I know about Elite A/V,1,1
"Jeremy, Chris and Dylan did a great job. They are very professional and knowledgeable.  Highly recommend them.",1,1
"Elite AV has done all my stereo equipment in my home, my hard and now my home theatre. I recommend them to all my friends. Jeremy and his team are quick, responsive and were able to get my home movie theatre in place in time for Christmas.   They even stay late and show up any day. I haven't been happier with a tech service.   A big Thank You to Elite AV  Geoff Radcliffe",1,1
"Jeremy is the best - highly knowledgeable, honest, trustworthy and fair. Everything you could ask for in an A/V specialist! In addition, his team is extremely courteous and respectful when working in my home, and they pay incredible attention to detail. I highly recommend them!",1,1
"This review is a long time over due. I have dealt with Jeremy in the past. When he told me he was sending one of his guys out to check an issue I was having , I was a little reluctant because I am picky about who works on my system. Dylan showed up promptly and even contacted us prior to him showing up. He sold me on 2 universal remotes for my living room and my theater. At first I thought it was a bit pricey but after the amazing job Dylan did I feel like I should have paid more. My system works better than it ever has and above any expectations I could have imagined. He was very concerned with my needs and asked many questions to make sure I got what I wanted. I'm sorry it took so long to leave a review but I was just using my remote thinking how simple everything has become and felt the need to leave this review. So thank you very much Dylan and Jeremy. Job well done and more.",1,1
"Great job by the Elite AV team on setting up my 65"" 4K TV and receiver.  In addition they also set up my XBox, Apple TV and DVD player and checked the surround sound speakers, wub woofer and center speakers to make sure everything was working right.  I couldn't be happier with the care they showed to our home in set up and clean up.  I was very impressed and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to others.",1,1
"Jeremy is the best!  He is super professional.  His work is outstanding.  He is current on all the new and latest technology out there.  He always has a solution on how to update and improve any audio/visual stuff I have going on in my house   His work is meticulous.  He is neat with his wiring and labeling, making it easy and clear for anyone to understand how to operate anything he has put together.    He is reliable.  He is prompt with return phone calls, emails and appointments.   I would confidently recommend Elite A/V!!!",1,1
"I hired Jeremy and his team to mount 26 TVs for a few commercial projects in Vegas and they did a wonderful job! They were professional, on time, and very reasonably priced. I would definitely use them again!",1,1
"From scheduling to installation day, everything went smoothly and as planned. This company is very professional and Jeremy and Chris were great in answering my questions, on behalf of my employer, for a surround sound installation in his home. They called prior to arriving, arrived on time and were prompt in setting up the system. Would recommend them to anyone.",1,1
"Why haven't I reviewed this guys sooner? They are awesome, excellent, professional and more!  I had them come to my house to relocate some A/V wiring, and while they where here they spotted some wiring issues on my Home theater system and fixed them at no additional charge, they even went into my attic to re-route some wiring.  They are so good, I hired them to do the complete system / network wiring for  a company I work for!",1,1
"Read the reviews and were impressed, so I thought I would give them a try.  I'm glad I did.  They deserve the ratings and live up to their reputation.  I was fortunate to remodel my home and could include them in the design of every room.  They were patient all throughout the process.  As with most all construction projects, change, change, change!  They stuck it through and were able to accommodate the entire way.  The prewire looked excellent.  They thought ahead and made sure wires could be pulled easily through the attic by hanging them rather than laying them on top of the beams ( I thought that was worth mentioning).  When we finally finished, they came to install all the fun stuff.  All the equipment was placed in a professional rack.  They even added LED's which gave it a nice touch! Most importantly, everything works like they advertised.  My lights are programmed for scenes and just need a push of a single button.  My automation system even reminds me to take out the trash. I'm living in the future thanks to Elite AV.",1,1
"Iam sitting here in my awesome home theater-man cave!!! Chris did a great job hooking up and wiring my place of Both entertainment and refuge!! The whole company from start to finish was very knowledgable, professional, experienced, fairly / competitively priced and cool to work with... I would highly recommend them for all your AUDIO VISUAL install needs!!!! This company gets 5 stars!!!! Now I will get back to my movie and popcorn!!!!!!!!!!",1,1
"I am blown away by how awesome these guys were!! They just left, and I couldn't wait to jump on and give them a rave review!! My new tv is installed perfectly, and I'm actually in a great mood despite waking up at 8:30 a.m. to let strangers into my home, thanks to their great attitudes, their polite efficiency, and their kindness. They were so pleasant and funny and helpful, and they left everything clean and saved me a whole mountain of trouble. I could not be happier!!!",1,1
"BOY YOU GOT IT.  THEY ARE GOOD, FAST AND VERY PROFESSIONAL.  We have 2 surround systems and several TVs that we have upgraded, added a sound bar outside and  installed Rogu on all of them through out our home.  Dylan and his team also installed a complete system with a TV in each of the bedrooms and in the living area (7 total big screen tvs ) and all the bells and whistles at our Air B & B.  Everything works perfect and sounds outrageous.  I can't tell you how HAPPY WE ARE!!  IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF ANY AUDIO, VIDEO SYSTEM, OR INTERGRATION, DYLAN IS THE TECH YOU NEED TO CALL.  We have had service done by others and we always have had problems. They would come and fix a problem, and we would end up with a different problem because of it and each time it cost us a lot of money.  Not with Dylan and his team  THEY GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.  THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  They actually give you a real phone number and are happy to answer any questions you may have.  They show up on time and get right to work and even clean up after themselves.  So Woohoo is right!!!!",1,1
Dylan and Travis did a great job mounting my TV. Will 100 percent be using this company in the future.,1,1
"These guys are very professional they were on time everything was setup with perfection they even vacuum my floors as they were going! Fair an reasonable price I would highly recommend this company an iam a very very picky guy but they met all my expectations with flying colors so iam a happy customer thank alot u guys for my 135"" projector screen look like An AMC theater lol !!!!!!!",1,1
"Had Dylan and his crew come out to my place to install a TV Wall Mount and then had them come out again to install a set of in-wall and in-ceiling speakers.  I love home theater and was very particular about how I wanted everything laid out. They were very patient and worked with me on making sure they mounted and installed everything exactly the way I wanted.  My project required cutting and drilling in to my walls and they went too great lengths to protect all my furniture and equipment from the dust and debris while they worked. When they were done, they vacuumed up all the mess and made sure the furniture was carefully moved back.  They do good work, take pride in what they do, and are very reasonable when it comes to cost of labor. Definitely will use again or recommend to others.",1,1
"This review is almost 2 years past due, but they did such a great job that I felt I still owed it to them. We needed an extra large TV mounted and were looking into having surround sound installed. They suggested a sound bar and booster instead of adding ceiling speakers which turned out to be more economical and it sounds incredible. We have had no issues at all and are very happy with the system. These guys were clean and efficient and fairly priced. We will not hesitate to use them if the need should arise in the future.",1,1
"Elite A/V did an amazing job installing two 65"" and two 55"" TVs in our new home. Jake came out and did a comprehensive analysis of what options were available which provided us with a great menu from which to choose how much we wanted to do. On the day of installation, the crew was here for most of the day. They were efficient, respectful, NEAT AND CLEAN, and did a superb job of installing and explaining what the myriad remotes were for. A special THANK YOU to Dylan - he stayed longer to get us signed up for and explain Roku, Pluto, etc. Since that day, I've texted Dylan with questions several times and he even called me at 8:00 at night to talk about an issue. He has always responded within 30 minutes and has always solved my problem. I cannot imagine ever, ever using anyone else for my a/v, sound, and entertainment needs!  Thank you Dylan. Jake and the entire Elite Crew!!! Michele and Harold",1,1
"We can't give enough praise to Elite A/V. when we hired them(for TVs and wire system)we were skeptical. Because we didn't know anything about A/V system. But they(Jeremy and all team crew)were very honest & knowledgeable, professional. My Husband is very specific but they worked with us very friendly and we had great customer service. We were very Happy what we got from Elite A/V service. I highly recommend this company to all.",1,1
Chris is a true mensch! He did a super professional install of a flat panel and promised me he would come back and make a minor adjustment when I requested a change. He did make that adjustment and without additional charge like he promised.  Good quality and good service is a hard combo to find in vegas but this company has both!,1,1
The ultimate professionals. Prompt and efficient. Highly knowledgable and courteous. Job well done!,1,1
"Jeremy is a great worker, very knowledgable and honest. Such quality work for the price too! I highly recommend Elite AV.",1,1
"This company is amazing. We have a small office near to them and they were able to understand and take care of all of our needs. We were looking for a camera system with remote viewing capability, an in-ceiling music system and an alarm system. They provided great equipment and expert solutions for all of our issues and worked within our budget. They were even able to tie into some of our existing components. We were impressed that the installation went quickly and smoothly. The mess from the installation was cleaned up so well, you would never have know anyone was there. All of the equipment works and sounds great. Jeremy and entire team at Elite AV were professional and an absolute pleasure to work with. They are truly experts in this field with a depth of understanding that I could not find anywhere else. Both the service and products they sell are all top notch. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for any type of audio, video or alarm system for their home or business.",1,1
Jeremy did a fantastic job at a fair price and we have stellar sound in our home and our patios. On top of that we finally have a universal remote that actually works and with our Sonos receiver we can select multiple inputs and place select audio in select rooms or flood the home and patio with the same audio. No surprises and quality work. Let Jeremy show you how to accomplish your needs without breaking your bank!,1,1
"Couldn't be happier with the service from Elite.  We first started with Tweeter years ago for our initial home theater setup.  Then we went with Geek Squad.  Still not satisfied, we turned to Yelp & found Elite A/V.  We will not use anyone else.  Jeremy was very helpful in our initial visit.  We had him do a small job recently & couldn't have been more professional.  Always on time; did what had been contracted & we couldn't be happier with the result.  There's no way you can go wrong with Elite.",1,1
Super professional! I bought a flatscreen tv from them and they were comparable to big-box retailers. Best part is they mounted it on the wall for half the cost of big-box retailer. We will use them for subsequent television needs!,1,1
"Jeremy and Chris are as good as as A/V installers can get and their guys are just as good! Professional, on time and really good to work with!  They made the entire process fun.  First, you can immediately tell that these guys know what they are doing - they've ""been there and done that.""  They are personable, professional and make you feel at ease - whether you buy gear from them or have your own, you can be assured that they will treat you the same and give you top notch advice on both integration and installation.  Although it's always best to get the gear from them and what they recommend, if you already have your own, they'll still work with you - which is different than MOST companies who will refuse your work altogether.  This is why Elite is so great.  My project was by far NOT the biggest because I'm a geek and like to do a lot myself, but they didn't shy away.  They did the work with a fervor and completed it with just as much energy and enthusiasm as if it was an entire house automation system with $250k worth of gear.  If you choose another company to do your work, you are making a mistake.  They did ZERO damage, nothing was amiss, the place was treated with respect and they were laughing and joking with me the entire time making me feel comfortable.  They quoted me to install my projector and screen, but even spent time terminating a few sub cables I had and did a quick calibration on the projector just to ensure the screen was ""OK.""  Who does that?  In Las Vegas, where everyone is out for the money, this is a company that is more interested in customer satisfaction and value.  I would work with them again in a heart beat.  Again, if you choose another company for your work - it's your mistake, don't say I didn't warn you!  PS: When they make a recommendation, believe me - take it.",1,1
"These guys were Prompt, Punctual and Professional. Was able to get the job scheduled the next day and they finished my TV mounting w/in a few hours and did a clean job. Good job guys!",1,1
Always amazing food and service. Love their chicken Parm sandwich. Their blizzards are awesome too.,1,1
"I love this location! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Also, you just can't beat the $5 meal special.",1,1
"Upon my usual weekly jaunt down to the St. Lawrence market I found myself staring into a neatly tucked away Shoppers Drug Mart at the corner of Esplenade and Jarvis. A life sized Justin Bieber cut out (my 11 year old selfs secret fantasy), was strategically display in the front window of the Beauty Boutique along with his latest fragrance line to draw in any stray window shoppers ( of course I'm convincing myself it was really my subconscious wanting to escape the mere minus 30 weather outside)   Walking in I certainly didn't expect to walk out with over $200 worth of cosmetics. Upon first entering I was greeted by a lovely tall, bubbly, blonde that not only looked but sounded like a Disney princess. She was quick to ask if I needed any help or if there was anything in particular I was looking for. When I assured her I was just ""browsing"" as us window shoppers do, she offered to give me a complimentary makeover. I have never been one to decline a little free pampering here and there so I quickly obliged making my self comfortable on a fancy black chair next to her.   And so It began; a little Clarins Ever Matte foundation, followed by both Benefit blush in Coralista and Benefit They're Real mascara ( which might I add is probably the best mascara in the existence of mascaras), next was the Lise Watier lipstick in Evasion and to finish it off a spritz of Marc Jacobs new scent ""Dot"" ...vuala  she held up a mirror to show me her finished canvas and ten minutes later I was standing at the check out.   The customer service was great, the product knowledge of the associate was excellent, the sales pitch was well played, the free samples were an added bonus...oh and my fancy new picture beside the Justin Bieber cutout left my 11 year old self jumping up and down on the inside. If you are looking to buy cosmetic this is the place to visit.",1,1
"A decent sized Shoppers Drugmart which has a full service pharmacy and has groceries as well. They recently added as small meat and fresh vegetable section . It is clean and the staff are friendly. The only thing I would change is the hours it should be open 24 hours, being located downtown.",1,1
"Large, beautiful and clean beauty boutique with brands that aren't typically found in Shoppers!",1,1
"i wanted to write a note about the great service I had recently at this location. I went in looking for makeup products and I am not really knowledgable in that regard but the Cosmetic Attendant (bright red/orange hair) was great. She came right over and asked if we needed help, she pointed out quality products and could tell me all about them. She saved me so much time and effort! Thanks again!",1,1
"This is the latest addition to feed my Shoppers Drug Mart addiction.  I strolled in laden down with groceries on the opening day, looking like a vagrant, but was treated like a red carpet worthy customer.  I was served by Maxine, the beauty manager, and she was simply lovely.  Very sweet, knowledgeable, sense of humour and not at all pushy.  I walked out happier than when i walked in and it was purely based on service received; not the cut price package of Pirate cookies that made it into my basket.  The store itself is medium sized but seems to pack pretty much everything in.  You have to scoot by the Beauty Boutique to get to the main part which is pretty sneaky.  It's so hard to resist all those shiny, colourful (and expensive) things.  It's a well stocked Beauty Boutique too with the usual Lancome, Clarins, Elizabeth Arden etc as well as Lise Watier, Benefit etc.   The rest of the store is sparkling (well, it is new) and full of the usual mixture of a few groceries, medications, cosmetics etc.  Staff were genuinely pleasant and everybody seemed happy to be there.  This one is  a keeper.  I'll definitely be adding it to my list of places to spend money!",1,1
This has been my go to dentist office for years. I absolutely love it. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The dentist are all amazing and very gentle. I had two teeth pulled on a Monday evening and was back at work on Tuesday working with no swelling or pain.,1,1
"Kudos to Vogel & Matesi and specifically to assistant Sally and Dr. Savla. I was traveling to Phoenix and was in tremendous pain. Not only were they able to fit me in their busy schedule, they did the first stage of root canal very quickly and professionally, the pain was gone right after! Thank you guys!",1,1
"I am an Arizona native but have never seen the beauty of our state like this - from a float plane!    We took off from the Scottsdale Air-park with our friends in the Desert Splash Adventures Cessna Caravan Sea Plane. The plane holds 9. For the next hour and a half, we flew through all of the canyons along the ""Apache Air Trail"" as the pilot called it.  The pilot, Carl, is a 3rd generation pilot from Alaska and does a great job providing the history of the area along with some humor.  You get to see all of the bridges and dams along the way. The best part of the trip for me was the water landing on Lake Roosevelt.  Never done that before! After takeoff we then flew past ancient Indian cliff ruins, Weaver's Needle and the Superstitions before returning to Scottsdale.  What a fun time.  I maxed out the memory card in my camera but plan to do this again. They have powered kayaks you can use on Roosevelt that I want to try on the next trip.",1,1
A float plane in the desert? What?! This is the best deal ever in Arizona!   The Apache Trail Tour starts at Scottsdale airport and flies you all over the Valley. Pilot Rob really knows his stuff and is a great narrator when it comes to the history of the area and what you're seeing out of your windows.  Splash landing!! But not bouncy. The touchdown on Roosevelt Lake was so smooth I actually couldn't tell when we landed on the water. After taxiing to the shore we were able to get out and explore for a while.   The total time was two hours. This is a great tour for all ages. The kids had a blast and we had four generations on our plane. Everybody loved it! They do private parties and brunches on the lake as well. We will definitely be back!,1,1
"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this experience.  We bid on this for a charity and had no expectations.  We've lived in Arizona for a long time and had no idea how gorgeous our state could be.  I'm not a fan of small planes but this was so easy and gorgeous.  Great people, gorgeous surroundings, and amazing food.  This is a can't miss Arizona experience!!",1,1
"I got this ride as a christmas gift but put off doing it until the gift nearly expired.  I'm a private pilot and I've flown through the Superstition mountains a few times(though I never landed on the water) so it kind of didn't seem all that exciting to me.  Boy was I wrong!  Rob, the pilot, gave me a new appreciation for flying that route.  Its a great and exciting way to see the canyons and lakes of the east valley and do something few people ever experience.    If you think you've seen it all around here, check out this tour.",1,1
"Decor and service leave much to be desired, but the food is worthy of 4.5 stars. I've eaten at both locations several times now over the past year, since moving from San Diego, and I think the food is very good.  The fried chicken and Polish Boy in particular are awesome.  The ribs are just average. good sauce, but not super tender and have not been smoked enough for my taste.",1,1
My husband and I ate here tonight for the first time and it will NOT be our last! The fried chicken is best I've ever had  and my ppl are from South Carolina! His sauce is very very good! And the owner was very hospitable and spoke to us about the  history of this famous restaurant. They will be taping on Rachel Ray's show next week! Kudos y'all!,1,1
"Seti's truck wasn't around so we decided to head to a restaurant with polish boys that didn't have wheels. I'm really glad we did that - the combo of the polish...girl...was delicious!  It had the added pulled pork on it, the combo of flavors, perfect.    What the fam really loved was that sauce.  I'll probably never be in Cleveland again, but I'll dream of that sauce.  We got the fried chicken, stuck the sauce on the side...but I can see why people just have it drenching that chicken.  Glad we did get it on the side, though, since it was glorious to dip everything into it.  Almost ordered another fries just as a vehicle for the hot sauce.",1,1
"I love Hot Sauce Wiliams. Well, I love their food. Their service is very hit or miss.  Though HSW is a bbq joint, I don't think it's necessarily their strongest point. The bbq sauce is really fantastic. The ribs and pulled pork are really good, but not really great. Granted, that's really comparing to at-home bbq using a smoker. When it comes to restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find better bbq in NE Ohio. And it's definitely better than other Ohio bbq chains like Carolina BBQ and City BBQ.   Where HSW really shines is their fried chicken and Po Boy and Po Girl. The fried chicken is easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had - crisp skin, cooked to perfect doneness. But if you go to HSW, be sure to get a Po Boy or Po Girl. What's the exact difference? I don't remember. The better one is the one with a hot sausage in a bun topped with pork shoulder, french fries, coleslaw, and french fries (I think that's the po girl). I cannot eat it with my hands, because it falls apart. If you can eat it without utensils, then give yourself 100 extra Man Points (c). Unfortunately, I dont get to make it to HSW very often, so I've not been able to try their fried fish or several other foods.  For drinks, they have soda machines and HUGs (kool aid in a tiny barel). Last time I was there, they didn't have a soda machine, so no free refills, which is a bummer  Though I love the food and their pink & blue color scheme outside, I think they only hire terrible people to work the registers. I've literally never eaten there and experienced a cashier that wasn't rude. They not only seemed to hate me on a personal level, but were offended by my audacity of ordering food there. With that being said, the cooks and individuals handing out the food have always been very sweet and friendly. Also, there was an employee my first visit there who helped me open a stuck bathroom door, and he was really great. I'm confused as to why the cashiers have been awful. Granted, I haven't been to HSW in well over a year since I moved out of state, so perhaps their cashiers are less butthurt now.  If I remember correctly, all locations are not places you want to be late and night by yourself with obvious fistfuls of cash (if ya catch my drift), so if you're an easily scared white person, go for lunch. Also, they used to only accept cash - not sure if that's changed.  If you're looking for a local restaurant and would like some soul food or bbq, I very highly recommend HSW. Also, the Carnegie location is right down the road from the Cleveland Clinic main campus. So, if you have an appointment with your cardiologist or nutritionist or whatever, you may as well stop by for some lunchtime fried perch and peach cobbler after your appointment.",1,1
"Best fried chicken out there. Skip the hot sauce, it isn't hot, and is frankly pretty disgusting. The various sides on offer are mediocre. There is a high likelihood of there being no food in the restaurant, especially later in the day, so call before going. Seems like it's takeout only in spite of having a large restaurant space.",1,1
"1st time visitor. Portions were great and the personable service really gave it that home feel. Had the Rib Tip....my oh my, shut my mouth.  What was that devine creation?  Go get you some now! Good food + nice price = great atomphsere.  Enjoyed learning their history via the cook during her lunch break. You know if Samuel Jackson and Charlie Sheen dine there it's gotta be good.",1,1
"Despite being slathered in their sauce, this fried chicken surprisingly maintains its crispiness and isn't the least bit overpowered by the flavors of the sauce. Actually, the sauce compliments the chicken so well that it had me asking for more- I even bought a bottle of their original sauce for the road since we were just visiting Cleveland. Of the two sides that were ordered, the mac n cheese tastes similar to a homemade baked dish packed with cheesy goodness. The fried okra was decent, but was coated in so much batter that I could barely taste the okra. In addition to the good food, the service is also worth mentioning- everyone behind the counter was hospitable and made for a great first visit to Hot Sauce Williams",1,1
"I'm going to keep my review short and sweet!   Polish Boy and the wings, OFF THE CHAIN!  Nuff siad!",1,1
Hot Sauce Williams is a Cleveland tradition! I will always stop here for the fries with sauce!,1,1
"hot sauce williams is amazing, but it is certainly not a place to go for a low calorie meal. fried chicken, st. louis style ribs, mac n cheese, sweet potato pie, etc. it's all awesome. the fried chicken is done perfectly! my mouth waters just thinking of this place. its a simple place, you order from a counter and can either take your food to go or eat it there. all that matters is the food is killer!",1,1
"Hot Sauce Williams is a Cleveland institution... Put in other words- you have to try this place at least once.   The sauce isn't for everyone. It's a vinegar based sauce with a little heat to it. I absolutely LOVE it but I know others who prefer a thicker sauce. I normally go with the 2 piece all white dinner with the sauce on everything. The fried chicken is some of the best in Cleveland. The fries, slaw and bread are all solid and for what you pay ($6.99 for my meal) you get a ton of food. The inside of the restaurant is very old school-- definitely not a place for suits and ties. It has a drive thru which is super convenient, especially considering the area it is in.",1,1
"I have been going here for at long time and its one of few places I can overlook bad service because I love the food. The wings are great, best wings in Cleveland but the best offering from here is the barbeque sauce. Better service and it would be 5 stars.",1,1
"I like to do Man vs. Food tours whenever I visit a city for work, and while planning for Cleveland, Hot Sauce Williams and their Polish Boy definitely made it onto my list of must eats. Man oh man, it did not disappoint. That Polish Boy is AMAZING. I'm a huge fan of your typical hotdog with coleslaw, not so much hot sauce or putting fries on things. But I'm telling you, this thing is spot on! The hot sauce wasn't too hot, the fries melded together with everything else in a special and tasty way, and the slaw and kielbasa were delicious. You have to try it if you get the chance. No wonder it's a signature Cleveland food.   I did do the drive thru (after reading other reviews this white girl didn't want to risk going inside by herself late on a Saturday night) but didn't have any issue with a long wait - maybe 3 minutes tops. Glad there were no harassing panhandlers around either. I was bummed they were out of banana pudding but the strawberry cheesecake was ok.   Bottom line: go get yourself a Polish Boy!",1,1
Hot Sauce Williams takes the best BBQ in Cleveland in my option. The home made mac and cheese is astonishing. The chicken is drenched in sauce and you just have to saver the flavor. I love to lick my fingers clean to finish off my meal.,1,1
"This is probably going to be one of my favorite places that I stopped at on my cross-country trip...thanks yelpers for letting me know it's worth going to the shadier part of cleveland (which isn't THAT bad) to get my grub on.  The two things you have to get when you go to this joint are the macaroni and cheese (my husband says it's the best he ever had and he's a snob when it comes to fatty foods) and the fried chicken (this was so juicy and flavorful on this inside and deliciously crispy on the outside). OMG, seriously run there is you have the privilege of being in Cleveland.   Oh, and a few other pointers: Cornbread was not good at all. I didn't try the coleslaw because it was super lathered in mayo. We also had the pulled pork sandwich, which was really good too. The bbq sauce is flavorful, but not hot at all. I liked it on the pork, but I'm glad I didn't get the fried chicken drenched in the sauce - better on its own.",1,1
"I know others have been moaning about their service, but our experience last Sunday was great.   We were disappointed about the dining room being closed, but the drive through was open and the staff were very patient with our endless debate about what to order (our son can be finicky). They even chimed in with recommendations when they told us that Fried Okra was unavailable.  The food was incredible -- and really messy in the car as we scarfed it down on our way back to NYC. We had Polish Girls, Mac and Cheese, Black-Eyed Peas and a Pork Shoulder sandwich. The sauce is really special.   We strongly recommend it to everyone. Great food, great service, really cheap.",1,1
"I wont lie.. I was a little scared to enter this restaurant. I have always wanted to eat here but the location on Lee has a horrible reputation for .. well if haven't heard.. picture the scene from Animal house when they all walk into the bar where Otis is playing.. Nuf said.  I had heard that Man Vs Food was at this location, so i figured i would give it a shot. Upon entering most places the food network has been you will notice that not only do the places raise their prices, but pictures and plaques are everywhere commemorating the event. Had you not seen the episode, you would never know they had been there.. Its as if they couldn't have cared less..  So i asked the girl.. ""Whats good""  and with out even hesitation she fires back ""You gotta try the polish girl and you might as well have the fried chicken too.."" With that type of certainty.. i had to reply ""Well. OK!"" She then asked me ""You want our sauce on your chicken?"" To which i asked "" I dont know, do i?"" She promptly said yes and ladled it on. For those who dont know.. A polish girl is a sausage (hot dog like) on a bun with french fries, pulled pork, coleslaw and their sauce.. Its about as good of a sandwich as you will ever taste.  Now fellow Yelpers.. I have been known to exaggerate a little to heighten the effectiveness and entertainment value of a good story.. But i say to you today.... That is the best fried chicken that has ever passed my lips. The very wise and helpful woman who took my order was appreciated ever time i took a bite of that chicken. That sauce.. complimenting an already outstanding chicken breast.. I well up with tears just thinking about how unbelievably good that food was.   On another note.. Buy a F*cking mop already.. The place is absolutely deplorable. I needed rubber gloves and a hasmat suit to enter the place. Seriously... what is that 10 years of grime on the molding? Its absolutely disgusting. How you havent been sited is beyond me.. Perhaps people are so blinded by the food (as i was) that they don't notice or care. You would have had 5 stars, but i just couldn't get over how dirty it was..",1,1
"I had always seen this place growing up, but I never actually tried it until this past Christmas! The fried chicken was probably the best I have ever had; worth every calorie! I had the sweet potato fries and they were great and crispy.  Everyone was really nice; the cook even came out and took a photo with us when I told him that I was visiting and had always wanted to try the place! I will definitely be coming back!",1,1
"Um, can I just say that I want another 15 orders? This stuff is so so delicious. It has had rave reviews from all sorts of TV shows and I had to try. So last night, after a full weekend of eating, I decided I could just put on some super loose eating pants and go and get my fill.   We ordered the rib tip meal and the thigh snack. The rib tips were well cooked and the SAUCE! That is the winning ingredient. The ribs themselves were a little bit tough at times, but that sauce is really what makes your mouth water. We also got the macaroni and cheese as a side and as a not usual fan of mac and cheese (I KNOW, I'm the devil for saying such ludicrous things) I wasn't expecting to finish the ENTIRE tub by myself. My boyfriend wished he acted faster, because he just got a small taste.   What you have to be careful about when you go late at night is that they close the doors and you have to order in the drive through. The intercom doesn't work so you drive up to the window and order. They take about 5 to 8 minutes to get your order. During that time, there will be homeless people that approach you. If that's not your scene, you won't score some awesome ribs. The environment its in is not great, but the food will surely make you want to come back.",1,1
"Forget about the place and service (which were fine) and let's talk about the food!  The Polish Boy was good, but the fried chicken was AMAZING!!  And the sauce was killer!",1,1
The chicken and po boy was amazing. Possibly the best I ever had. Get it with the sauce loaded on the chicken and fries. Staff was super friendly.   I will come back next time I am in the neighborhood I visited because it wAs a nice walk from the Cleveland clinic. Probably not the best idea at night but during the day it was great.,1,1
"Hot Sauce Williams is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine :) My favorite dish from here is the fried chicken and ribs dinner. For sides, I get the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. They give you sooooo much food for just under $12!   The servers work only behind the food stand, so you pretty much have to clean off the tables yourself. You may at first be deterred from this place by its lack of cleanliness, but the food is so worth it!  One thing to keep in mind, they don't provide free water, but a bottle of water is only $1.   Definitely worth checking out!",1,1
Loved this spot! I got the pork plate which is shoulder with slaw and bread covered in sauce. Came with fries that I had them add sauce to. Just amazing. I've had bbq so many ways and I appreciated how unique and delicious this spot was!,1,1
"If you don't like this place, chances are you don't know what good barbeque is.  I had the rib tip dinner (Off menu btw). This is a good alternative to the full rib dinner. It is still a ton of food, but not quite as much! The sauce is delicious.  As of 27 Feb 2011, you get a free plastic Pepsi 'Courtesy Cup' if you buy any one of their sodas.  Yes it's dirty, informal and right in the middle of an extremely sketchy neighborhood. IMO Cleveland needs more places like this. There are way too many places that wish with all of their might to be located in Manhattan or LA. Guess what? You're in Cleveland. Now ditch the valet and the uppity atmosphere, and give me some food.",1,1
"Where do I start....My family & I went here on Saturday night and ordered 2-4 piece chicken dinners & 1-2 piece chicken dinner.  We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait!!!  The chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh, drumstick coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about  heaven!!!! You can get the sauce on the side though if you're not too adventurous.   Now the service, that's another story.  Let me just say they need a tutorial on  customer service.  I'm a person who believes in second chances, so we tried this place again on Sunday and the service was the same....The only thing that changed was the table cloths?.....The reason why I gave this place a 4 star is because of the food but the service could use a lot of upgrading!!!  I would suggest that you call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food, it's like watchin' paint dry!!",1,1
Came here on Saturday evening and there was a line about 10 people in front of me. I ordered a 3 pieces white dinner and was expected to get my food within 10-15 mins; however it took me about more than half hour to get the food. It's fair to say that efficiency was not their priority. Despite the service the food was absolutely amazing. Great value with great taste. The chicken breasts were tender and not too oily. The sauce was top natch.,1,1
"Solid BBQ spot- definitely recommend!  Pros: Reasonably priced and delicious.  Cons: Food was pre-prepared and clearly sitting out a while before we got there.   The taste and flavor are outstanding! I kept it simple and ordered Ribs and fries. Sauce had me like ""mmmmmm mmhhhmmmm"" and ribs were like ""Ahhhhh yaaa ahhhhh."" Great time had by all!",1,1
"Got the chicken and ribs dinner with green beans and fries. All delicious. Pretty much as close to being in the south as you can get in Cleveland.  Served in foam carry out trays, fancy. The only thing lacking was the service but really I expected that.",1,1
I shamlessly admit to straining that tin foil that comes with my rib order like a rag to get more of that tasty bbq sauce.,1,1
"This place is oh so tasty!!  The great thing about their chicken is that, you don't even need their hot sauce for it to taste so good.  With the hot sauce, the chicken goes from good to great.  The pieces of chicken are typically big, hot, and filling.  Truly hit the spot if you're wanting a taste of the south, up here in Northeast Ohio.  The only problems I had with this place was that they close the dining room in the afternoon on Sunday (luckily they have the drive thru open) and the sides aren't seasoned well enough.  Overall, this place is must try place.",1,1
By far the greatest place to visit. Been a fan for twenty years and until you come here you aint had real BBQ,1,1
"It seems they care about their food. Tried a polish boy (it's food, I swear). It had great taste but messier than a Hollywood divorce..with kids. Couldn't be happier with the hot sauce, chicken and ribs. Ton of food for a little money. No public restrooms, fake flowers on pink tablecloths in an old fast food joint. They still yell their orders to the back. So why are they on the travel channel? They actually care about their food.",1,1
Sweet merciful Fried Chicken and Polish Boys!  It is absolutely delicious food.,1,1
"Mrs. Doubtfire was here!  No really Robin Williams dined at this location.    The Fried chicken is crunch in your mouth drippy kind of good!   My favorite meal is the polish girl.  it just screams ""Eat Me!!""    polish dog piled high with pulled pork, crinkled fries drenched in slaw and oh so good tangy HSW sauce.   Oh how the sauce enhances the taste, Makes you want seconds  Now when you eat your hot Polish Girl, you have to be gentle it tends to get sloppy.  I ease on into it.  I always end up with a mess on my hands and face.  wipe down needed after this Feast.  Sometimes I settle for the polish boy, a little less mess and take it all in kind of treat   ""Ease on into it""",1,1
"Lovely, beautiful, and crowded. I didn't actually shop, just walked through and looked around, but there is beautiful art all around. Don't miss out.  If you need a break, come in here and just browse around. It's crowded, but for some reason, seems relaxing and calming.",1,1
Another one of my favorite places to shop in Vegas. I love the huge Victoria's Secret!!! Could spend entire day shopping here!,1,1
This gorgeous mall of shoppes in the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas are pricey for sure but it's lovely to look at all the upscale items. There are a few shops here and there that won't break your bank - look for Basin (a great little soap shop that has only one other location and that's in Orlando) and Fresh (great cosmetics) and other beauty stores. Lovely restaurants and super clean throughout.,1,1
"On a couple of occasions, we strolled through the Shoppes at the Palazzo.  The assortment of high end brands was satisfactory, but it was not all-inclusive.  For Chanel, LV, or other high end stores, you have to go across the street to the Mall.  The Shoppes at the Palazzo is well-decorated with marble floors and other fine textures.  If you do not like to gamble and have the means to shop at high end stores, this place is for you.  As a result, we usually stick to the slot machines!",1,1
"Lovely lovely lovely. I spent some time at the Tory Burch store. Bought some darling flats and nearly broke out into a huge sweat. Man its hot in there. No air circulation at all. Next was the Michael Kors store AGAIN. This store is much smaller than the one at The Forum. Huge Burberry store with clothes, bags, shoes, scarves, EVERYTHING. great selection. The ChloÃ© store was amazing as well.  But let me tell you what did it for me was the Christian Louboutin store. Beautiful selection. This mall is next to the Canal where all the gondolas are. Lovely area. The only thing was the floor plans of the stores were a little weird to follow.",1,1
"Holy Cow, what fun here! Shopping is exquisite. I think I need 3 more jobs to pay for it, but hey, you're in vegas! Beautifully presented merchandise and spacious stores are filled with really high end designers and it's fun to just window shop if you want. I went into the Coach store and they offer many bags not found anywhere else so it was a nice store. It's nice to grab an ice cream cone and walk around to people watch and window shop, then return to reality! Fashion mall was great alternative with things I can actually afford :)",1,1
"I couldn't find a Yelp listing for Elton's so I'm reviewing it here.  The store is tucked away on the upper level and I missed it the first time through the mall.  I could have bought everything in the store.  All of my favorite brands in one place including Mark Nason and Robert Graham. I found a shirt that I had to have, but I was leaving early the next morning and it needed some alterations.  I purchased the shirt just before dinner at Postrio and between dinner and dessert courses I excused myself to pick up my perfectly altered shirt and made it back in time for dessert.  Excellent service and fair prices.  Elton's will be a destination on my next trip back to Vegas.",1,1
"A calmer shopping scene than Forum Shops at Caesar or Fashion Show Mall and a good blend of couture boutiques to ready-to-wear, more accessible than Crystals and Wynn-Encore Esplanade. The Venetian setting remains classic and a unique experience.   Favorites include Chloe, DVF, Poleci, Barneys. Stop by Espressamente Illy for a delicious espresso or cappuccino.",1,1
"Though the Palazzo shares much in common with the Venetian, the Shoppes are not among them. The Palazzo is far superior in their quality of stores...including Thomas Pink, 7 for all Mankind, and Fresh (some of my favorites).   The Palazzo is well worth a visit for both the gambling and shopping. A great combination if you actually manage to take some money from the casinos (only to give it back at the shops).",1,1
"Nice shops, and clean floors. Window Shopping is always fun. The employees are courteous. I would save the 10 Dollars though and not see the Dealership. Few cars are down there and you can peek in from the stairs and see everything. It was wasted 10 dollars in my book.",1,1
"I don't care if I can't afford the ultra steep priced, high end stores.  This is a beautiful venue, richly decorated with a smattering of lovely fountains.  It was so pleasing to the eye, and honestly, I love browsing through the shops that will never be in my price range.  Okay, so I should think positively and HOPE for a day where I could afford it, but short of that happening, I can still browse and let out an occasional oooooh and aaaaah.  The decor is divine !!!!!!!!!!  I wanted to spend more time here, but we just didn't have it to spend.......money or time, come to think of it.  Another plus, easy access to this place from the Grand Canale Shoppes.  Just occurred to me, I never got to see the actual Palazzo Hotel........just saw the shops.  Oh well, all the more reason for a return visit, right ??",1,1
Beautiful Shops and Fabulous restaurants. The have valet and a parking garage. Easy access and beautiful place to shop.,1,1
"Got to love this little shop! They have all your needs and wants! You can come here to get a few t-shirts or do a little shopping for the room. Everything from water to juices, to your adult cocktails to medicine! They have it all here.  They are open 24 hours and located right beside the hotel elevators!",1,1
"OK, I have to admit: as a guy, it takes a fair amount for a shopping area to impress me, much less warrant a full 5 of 5 stars. So, gents, let me explain why this is actually happening and to have a successful / fun / enjoyable afternoon with your lady in Las Vegas.   Step 1: Regardless of where you're staying, suggest to them ""Today I think we should stop by one of the casino bars after breakfast and have some champagne. Then we'll game for a half hour or so after which we'll walk through the Palazzo and do some shopping"" - at which point she'll agree because you said the magic word: SHOPPING!  Step 2: Enact the plan - head down to the casino bar and ply her with mimosas or bellinis or whatever...so long as it has champagne in it, you're golden. Have a couple yourself. Gamble. Casually announce that you're off to do some shopping.  Step 3: Amble your way along to the Palazzo - if you come in through the front then walk through the casino, stop at a gelato shop, etc. Make it enjoyable.   Step 4: Upon arriving at the Palazzo your jaw will drop (yes, even you, lowly non shopping gents) at the staggering displays therein. And so will your lovely lady's jaw drop. Stop at a couple stores and then announce that you need a refill.   Step 5: Stop at the Double Helix Wine Bar and collect glasses of wine for your and your date / significant other.  Step 6: Tag along while they shop. You're now pleasantly buzzed and you'll find you don't hate it.   Step 7: While shopping you'll invariably find something that (a) costs a little less than what she was expecting and (b) costs a bit more than what you were expecting. BUY IT.   Step 8: The remainder of your trip to Vegas will be the best time of your life and you can pretty much do anything.  There you have it guys...I just showed you how to have THE BEST trip to Vegas with your lady / significant other.   PS: You can use this unlimited times and your gal will ALWAYS want to go back to Vegas then.",1,1
Beautiful place. Nice and simple with great art and service. They r connected with the Venetian so its really cool to walk over. Great for families. And they have a great view,1,1
Love shopping in Vegas! The Palazzo shops are great for everyone.  Just awesome to walk around and check out the decor.  Amazing place.,1,1
i found the shoppes in the palazzo to be relaxing and great place to walk around and window shop. the only store i could actually afford to buy anything was the victoria secret store. i picked up some beautiful bras and bubble bath.,1,1
"This is a beautiful upscale mall to shop in.  Even if your budget doesn't allow it, it's a great way to spend an afternoon window shopping.  A must see.",1,1
"I love this place - Tory Burch, Christan Louboutin, DVF, Catherine Malandrino, Jimmy Choo, 7 for All Mankind, Chloe, and Michael Kors, just to name a few.  Great place to window shop, though sometimes there are sales (watch out now!).  Great place to visit while the mister gambles.  I always hit up these shops, Venetian, Wynn, and the Fashion Show Mall.",1,1
"Can't say I've ever liked a dentist until now.   To start, the place is BEAUTIFUL. A very different look than you'd expect from your typical dental office.   I came in for my annual cleaning and this office is down the street from my house. The exam room is awesome, they had a TV on the ceiling, X-rays much easier that what I was use to and many other gadgets that not only made my exam more pleasant but more accurate for the Dr.   The staff are the sweetest people and super friendly from the receptionist to the tech assistant and the Dr himself.  Now 5 days later my teeth feel cleaner than ever. Side note I've dreaded all my other cleanings due to the pain following it, not this time.",1,1
"My dental work has come from Dr. Greep for a few years now. I would absolutely recommend this dental establishment. Nice, clean, diligent, friendly, and smaller with one on one service.",1,1
This is the best dental office I have ever been to. Dr. Greep is very professional. I had a lot of dental work done and he explained every step to me so I could understand. I didn't feel any pain. I highly recommend him.,1,1
Just purchased a Groupon for this location and my experience was great! (And yes they do accept proof of Groupon if the voucher is on your phone). The girl at the front desk was very friendly and knowledgeable! She even offered a free upgrade for the stronger bed due to the fact that the bed my Groupon was good for had been occupied and would have required a wait time. Above and beyond customer service!,1,1
"I can typically take or leave hotel restaurants as well, they are hotel restaurants.  Burnham is way different.   On our last AM in town we were hitting breakfast before hitting 71 to go home. Anthony was our server. Two omelets with wheat toast, fruit for me potatoes for my BFF. Coffee. Juice. Ice Tea.   What SOLD US and has us on Yelp and then Trip Advisor was my ask for ice water after I downed my coffee. Anthony turned around grabbed a glass, held it up and checked to make sure it was clean.  We went crazy - that NEVER happens but at the Burnham. When we praised him he said, ""I'm not gonna give out no dirty glass."" LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  When he stopped by to pick up our plates he so proudly said, ""I love picking up dirty clean plates!"" BAWHAHAHAHAHA! Just absolutely too cute.  Lots of professionalism. Lots of personality.  Quite the impression.   The food was perfect. The omelets were not in excess. Enough eggs and stuffing of our choice to balance it all out.  What an experience.  We hit so many breakfast places in town I'm sorry we didn't do this more than once. Thank you Anthony!",1,1
"I came to Cleveland to watch the cavaliers, raptors game the restaurant at the hotel was the burnham restaurant, we were all trying to figure out where to eat and we pulled the menu up on our phones and we decided this place. The service was some of the best I've had, My server Jeff was a very genuine guy, I've been to many restaurants where servers are nice, but it seems like it's a forced attitude, but I could tell Jeff even outside of work acted the exact same and was a joy to be around, The food was amazing too we tried a bit of everything and had no complaints about anything. Some of the food we had was the ""soul bowl"" which was pork belly on top of mac and cheese, the chicken wings confit, hangar steak, Buffalo chicken pizza, and a burger. I would get it all again, but the steak and the pork belly was my absolute 2 favourites, you have to try it out for yourself to see why I'm talking about!",1,1
"Came for my birthday dinner.  The hotel is new and very beautifully designed, and we had read good reviews of the Burnham.  Did not disappoint!  I recommend the small plates--so much choice!  I had the peiroghi, the fried chicken confit, and the table shared the cheese creme with mushroom.  H had the oyster spaghetti.  Excellent service--not pushy, not absent.  Crowd is good--dates/couples, friends/family meet up.  I don't think this is a kid place--definitely an adult vibe.  I'd like to stay down here and make it a whole night away in my own city.",1,1
"Fantastic restaurant in the Hilton Cleveland! We ordered salads and they were as good as the entrÃ©es. Huge offset bowls with enough fresh, unique ingredients (fresh, whole anchovies, pickled eggs, fresh shaved cheese) to make you think twice about ordering additional items from the menu...nah, there's more to explore! You have to try the French toast...yes, anytime of day! It's not what you think. Shredded chicken, a sauce and season combo that takes your taste buds on a roller coaster, and soft & slight crunch in the toast peeking from beneath. One of my all-time favorites!!",1,1
"What a refreshing experience! Beginning with a friendly greeting and seating, followed by a delicious breakfast buffet satisfying every imaginable taste desire, and all made better by the most polite and attentive server we have experienced in a long time. Craig was a pure delight! His contribution to our dining experience was as important as the food. Craig needs to be cloned.",1,1
"Nice upscale take on Cajun. Nice place for a rich dinner after a day of conference smarts. Our favorites were actually the appetizers: pierogies and the divine goat cheese creme brulee! Hanger steak was delicious and perfectly cooked, if a little salty.",1,1
We stayed at the hotel and decided to check out this restaurant. All of us were very impressed with the food and staff. The hanger steak I had was amazing. Their version of the carrot cake was nothing like I have ever had but it was great. If I ever go back to cleveland I will make sure I return.,1,1
"The Cleveland Plain Dealer gave this restaurant an excellent rating, so I made reservations.  After that I read other reviews, some of which were negative, so I dined a there tonight fearful that I had made a mistake.  I was delighted by the delicious food and excellent service!  I highly recommend it and hope that others will try it, as it was pretty empty on a Saturday night, although this could have been caused by upcoming Fathers' Day. Visit the bar on the 32nd floor for a wonderful view of the city. I will return and recommend it to my friends.",1,1
"I could go on for hours about how wonderful this place and its staff are. I had the best pancakes I've ever eaten and a wonderful mimosa. We came in at noon (lunch time), and the staff happily accommodated our dying need for some breakfast food. This is a must for brunch.",1,1
"I stopped in here a few weeks ago when my friend and I were trying to go to the rooftop bar, but it was closed for a private event and we were starving. It was pretty empty while we were in here, so we got a seat right away. Our server was great - very attentive and our food was super timely. I ordered the Southwest Shrimp Pizza, which was delicious. I wish I could have taken it home with me, but I was heading out for a night on the town, so I had nowhere to stash it. This place is great for an anniversary dinner, lunch with a friend or colleague, or a place to celebrate a family occasion.",1,1
Excellent service & food.  I had the grilled salmon & my husband had the muffuletta sandwich.  Yum!,1,1
"Chose to visit the new Hilton Downtown and new restaurant for a birthday.  Chose this restaurant because our party had been to most restaurants in Cleveland and the Burnham had only been open 16 days when we ate there.    Ours was a party of four and had no time constraints so we decided to do a couple courses of splitting the small plates.  After our incredible waiter Joseph walked us through some of his favorite things and some of the background for some of the food, we chose our first course as Octopus salad, soft shell crab special, chilaquiles, shrimp and grits, and fried rice.  All of these dishes were as advertised and devoured by our party.  The octopus salad was some of the most tender, tasty octopus we have had anywhere in the country let alone Cleveland.  The chilaquiles were like a mexican pancake with pulled pork and rock shrimp baked in.  The shrimp and grits were great.  Our second course we chose soul bowl (mac and cheese with pork belly and collard greens), boudin and mash (blood sausage and mashed potatoes), confit wings, and the five cheese pizza.  While I don't like collard greens, the mac and cheese and huge pieces of pork belly was good.  The blood sausage and mashed potatoes were a british/irish delicacy and delight.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were great.  The confit wings were a bit salty but they literally fell off the bone and were served with a green sauce that I can't quite figure out what it was.  The pizza was great topped with tomato and basil and quite flavorful.  Our party had a couple bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and some of their cocktails (Sacre Bleu and French 75).  The cocktails were all made from scratch and delicious.  The staff at this restaurant were incredible with multiple people from servers, hosts, back kitchen staff, and managers all making their way to our table to wish one a Happy Birthday and welcome us to the restaurant.  The new hotel is beautiful inside.  Wish the Bar 32 (bar and patio on the 32nd floor) was open but its still not finished.  Our server Joseph made the night especially nice with his knowledge and hospitality.  Would like to try breakfast/brunch next time maybe but we will definitely by back.",1,1
"I'm not sure why urban farmer has better review than this place. The food was really good for a restaurant that is maintained by the hotel. I've tried 4 different meal and dessert and nothing is bad.. I'm thinking that the review is low due to price but I can assure you that the quality and freshness of the  ingredients is fantastic.. u get what u paid for. The service is not bad... just a relax environment in which u can enjoy your dinner.. I'm giving this a 4.5 star due to price but if u are looking for a quality and taste, this is definitely a must try in Cleveland..  I recommend any seafood entree.. salmon, trout and walleye..",1,1
"Really enjoyed our night sitting at the bar at The Burnham. Rob the bartender/mixologist (not to sound too hipster but this guy is a professional) was very knowledgeable, funny and a great steward for Cleveland. He gave us tips on where to spend our weekend and he did not disappoint!  On to the food: Husbandface was obsessed with the pierogies, I was obsessed with the French toast small plate. I'm going to try to recreate it at home and will probably fail a million times it was so good.  Drinks: Thumbs up. Let Rob know what your tastes are and trust him to make you your personality in a glass. Because that pretty much happened.  It was our first time in Cleveland and we had to force ourselves to NOT go back to the Burnham for every meal just so we could branch out!",1,1
Had the fried chicken confit. I swear on earth I've never had anything better. It was the perfect size and the cheese dumplings on the side were perfect.,1,1
I love this place! Sherri the bartender was awesome and Chef Ryan brought the food directly to me! What a friendly environment I had the buffalo pizza and Caesar salad my first night and the muffalatta sandwich the next day. Everything was fresh and tasty!!,1,1
"Hotel restaurants are always hit or miss but this one was a nice experience. The ambiance is upbeat and lively -- an open kitchen will also help with that -- and the prices were fair, if not better than expected. My Cotes du Rhone RosÃ© was $9.50 a glass and the dinner specials on a Saturday night included a super affordable (and pleasantly portioned) Sous Vide Chicken plate. Nothing crazy but just a nice simple home cooked meal while traveling -- something we all crave.   The Sous Vide chicken was well prepared, maybe just a touch over done, and the creamy mash and broccolini were nice accompaniments. While the broccolini was a tad under-salted, the mashed potatoes were a bit over-salted so I ate them together and it was perfect. I can handle that. I wasn't however, a fan of the BBQ sauce that adorned the chicken. Thankfully, it was mostly served on the side so the dish was still a great choice.   Johnny was a very pleasant server and we worked up a nice rapport by the end. His recommendations were genuine and he steered me toward a dish that I would enjoy - one thing I appreciate in a server! His push for the featured Mitchell's Banana Pudding ice cream was a win, especially with his flexibility in swapping out the vanilla ice cream on the chocolate angel food cake dessert dish. Yum!  All in all, I think the restaurant offers good value, a fun vibe, and it's awesome that you can go for pre- or post-dinner drinks at the 32 Bar (rooftop)!  Final thing: I loved their dining chairs. Upholstered and so comfortable. It may sound silly but chairs make a huge difference! I felt relaxed the whole time.",1,1
"I'm always a little skeptical of hotel restaurants/bars, but this one impressed me. Everything was delicious and service was great. The atmosphere is pretty decent, but the patio wasn't open yet when I was there, so I suspect that it's great. The tapas are really unique, but my husband and I opted for entrees. I did see the table next to us, ordered tapas, and they looked and smelled amazing, and we're really generous portions. My husband thought his pork entree was smaller than he wanted, but my fish was perfection. I can't wait to go back for girls' night to order a bunch of small plates!",1,1
"The fact that this place has 3 dollar signs is not accurate to me. I had a chicken confit small plate, which was more than filling, and it was about $11. I was really craving fried chicken and that meal hit the spot with hints of exotic undertones! Really nice, modern, and quiet ambiance for a late dinner and the staff is readily available to suggest what to eat. My co-worker and I enjoyed the experience.   Only thing I would say is that the menu needs an interpreter basically. When you first look at it you read something like bread pudding but then underneath it states there are gizzards in it. Not typically what you would think, right? Fact of the matter is, after our waitress explained the take on bread pudding and french toast that they utilized, it was much easier to make a decision. My co-worker got a french toast type plate which was a savory take on a pulled pork dish and she thoroughly enjoyed it.",1,1
"I was at The Burnham for the first time this past weekend.  It was my friends birthday and we had a party of 6.  The service was great!  Our server was super nice, kept our drinks full and brought out our food in a timely manner.  I got the salmon and it was delicious!  The skin was super crispy and it was a large portion.  Everyone at the table was pleased with their dishes as well.  The staff was very welcoming.  I would highly suggest going here.",1,1
"The Burnham just opened on June 1st and we thought we'd try something new. Normally, new restaurants mess up something so our expectations were not high. Let me say this...Burnham was phenomenal and exceeded all of our expectations by leaps and bounds. I cannot wait to go back!  The decor is very modern, yet warm and inviting. The service was top notch and very friendly. We were seated next to the bar so had the chance to interact with their bartender who made the experience even better. Super friendly guy, very knowledgeable mixologist--everything he made was great. After the first round, we were letting him just give us whatever he wanted. He makes great mocktails too.  Food..OMG. I want to go back the very next day and repeat the entire experience. We ordered several small plates to start with: calamari, pierogis, and octopus. Everything was delicious and the preparations were creative and unlike what we've had at other restaurants. We especially loved the sauce on the pierogis and the octopus was so good we wound up getting another order. For dinner, we tried Oxtail, Burnham Burger, and Shrimp & Grits. Once again, everything was top notch...our plates were clean very quickly. Even the dishes we were on the fence about ordering we wound up raving about.   The Burnham is a great addition to Cleveland downtown - we'll be back!!",1,1
"The brunch buffet had a beautiful display and was dutifully maintained. The eggs were a strange, jiggly texture and bland. The French toast was great, but the syrup was flavorless. Excellent tasting and perfectly portioned smoothie shots. Not all of the items were clearly labeled so my vegan friend was upset from consuming meat in the potato hash. I recommend signs for each prepared item with symbols for meat, dairy, soy, seafood, and vegan items.   Thank you for handling our large group with great service and attention.",1,1
Great variety and the best dog in town. Try the rice crispy marshmallow shake/flurry thing. Ridiculous!,1,1
"Went to their grand opening on the June 17th and despite the fact that they were slammed I cannot say enough about the customer service and hustle the entire Retro Dog team exhibited.  The wait was long due to the insane amount of guests but have every expectation that their service will be no less than amazing going forward.  The atmosphere is bright and upbeat with an updated diner feel.  The original artwork speaks for itself.  I tried the Retro Dog as I am a HUGE fan of Coney dogs.  The sauce was different and sweeter than the ""traditional"" Coney sauce but a good surprising spin on an old original.  Toppings were ample and the natural casing hot dog cooked to perfection.  I ordered the Coney fries to go with and I may have overdosed on the Coney aspect of things and think they might ne better paired with a different dog.  Delicious all the same.  The custard cone with the salted chocolate dip and caramel was ridiculous.  Although full from my meal, I still couldn't help but finish.  The salted chocolate adds the perfect savory to the caramel's and custard's sweet.  Retro Dog is definitely worth a visit and I plan on returning multiple times to try the entire menu.",1,1
"This is my regular lunch stop when I am in Stow. The food is fantastic. There isn't an item on the menu I haven't had and haven't enjoyed.   Come for the food, but stay for the shakes.  If that isn't your thing go for the root beer on tap. It's the best in town.   The monthly food specials keep the menu interesting.   The absolute best aspect of Retro Dog is the staff. I haven't met a better crew anywhere else.   In short, this place receives two lion fists up from Voltron.",1,1
"If you are looking for a fun little place to go every once in a while, go here. They have all sorts of good quality hot dogs and hamburgers; including veggie style ones. The drinks and milkshakes are awesome, too. The ambiance is very cheesy, but it works. I want to write more about this place, but there really isn't a lot to say. It's a hot dog place...  You'll enjoy!",1,1
"Love this place! My kids ask to go every week! I don't eat red meat, so of course when my husband suggested a hot dog place I reluctantly went! I was pleasantly surprised by the menu! A veggie dog, chicken sandwich and veggie burger! I've had the veggie dog and chicken sandwich, both were great! I'm trying the veggie burger next! Oooh, and the milkshakes, so yummy. Oh and the veggie cheese fries, so good! Even if you like meat the veggie options will satisfy...just has my husband the meat eater!  Not only is the food great, the service is absolutely amazing too! So friendly!",1,1
"Fun place and something a little different.  Hot dog and burger options abound.  The onion rings and fries are greasy and delicious - dip them both in whatever magical sauce comes with the onion rings.  Chili and root beer are also good   This is not a place for people who are afraid of calories - they have a token side salad and a black bean burger if you want to feign healthy eating while scarfing fries. Ordering is kind of a pain especially if there's a line since there's not a lot of room to stand in line - you order at the counter; then the order taker takes your money and gets your drinks; you sit down; and they bring the food out to you sometimes having to call out by name.  They have car service outside, why not have wait service inside?",1,1
"Retro Root Beer in a FROSTY MUG! Super creamy, real Frozen Custard!   Burgers, Dogs and Fries with an overwhelming array of topping choices.  We visited on a Sunday evening, and ate inside.  Everything was fresh and delicious. Service was spot-on!  The Onion Rings were a highlight for me... Made fresh to order, tender inside, light and crisp fried tempura batter outside. I'm my opinion... They could NOT be better! Highly recommend that you give RETRO DOG a try!",1,1
1st trip here .. my husband had 2 dogs w/yellow mustard .. I had 1 w/chili + yellow mustard + 1 with chili + yellow mustard .. we both enjoyed our dogs .. but the stand out was the battered onion rings .. totally delicious .. wish we had gotten a large order to split but w/2 dogs each we wanted to pace ourselves .. root beer float & black cherry soda were the chosen beverages .. we will be back .. not only for more onion rings but perhaps to try a burger next time .. a bit of a drive from our home in Cleveland but a decent road trip to treat ourselves every so often .. far exceeded our expectations & now there is no need to go to Sonic ever again .. thank God!,1,1
"This review is written by my 6 year old son. ""The ice cream is really good and icy here. The twist is my favorite. Also, the grilled cheese is pretty cheesy!""",1,1
"My friends and I walked to Retro dog after school. We assumed it would be cheaper than wing warehouse. The staff was helpful and friendly. My friends and I got milkshakes and burgers. I got a milkshake and cheese fry and my friend, who I payed for, got a burger and milkshake. I didn't expect the total to come as $20 but we enjoyed our time there and the food was good.",1,1
"New drive in - classic style! Hosted my son's 8th birthday here and the staff and food is amazing. They brew their own pop, root beer and beer as well. Lots of special events and great burgers and dogs.",1,1
"Run, don't walk, to Retro Dog. Had lunch there yesterday. Great food and very nice and attentive people. Had dogs and delicious fries, very crispy and hot! Dogs had a nice snap and the buns were perfect. They have so much more than the dogs, too. Lots of choices. Don't let the exterior fool you, it's not just drive up. There is nice seating inside for at least 40. Get out to Retro Dog and support a local business with very good food and wonderful people!",1,1
"Love this place, cool decor, great menu and friendly staff.  We go out of our way just to eat here.  Most likely one of the rare instances where a hot dog place also offers great burgers, shakes and even a veggie option!",1,1
"Drove by after a long run and we were curious... No expectations...and were super happy after! We were pretty hungry, order a Carolina dog and Chicago dog (yum yum).  The all beef dogs are excellent and they have a good choice of hot dogs types.  The Buckeye shake was delightful, but we love PB and chocolate so you can't go wrong.  The fries were basic.  Would stop back if ever in the area again!",1,1
"Best Chicago Dogs around. Vienna hot dogs would be better, but these are the best we've had in the area! Kind of pricey, but cheaper than driving to Chicago! ;)",1,1
Talk about living the old car hop idea.  Retro Dog has amazing food and awesome service.  Their milk shakes are amazing.  The flavor combinations are always spot on.  You can go in or have the car hop come out and bring you your food.  Love it.,1,1
"Delicious natural casing dogs with a variety of toppings, great milkshakes, awesome design. Very happy to have this new addition to the scene.  EDIT: After many return visits I can say the quality is consistent and the staff is always very friendly and competent. It has become my favorite ""fast food"" stop. Oh, and try the Retro Burger, it is, dare I say, better than a Swenson's Galley Boy. I know, blasphemy, but true.",1,1
"Nice variety of dogs and burgers. Place has tasty vegetarian alternatives. Come alone, with friends, family or just you and the kids.",1,1
"Great local joint with an old fashion car hop service or eat in there dining area bar stools and tables.  They have great dogs, burgers made to perfection with all kinds of toppings.  The dogs are great love the Chicago dog best in the area.  The shakes and ice cream can't go wrong and try the old fashion root beer float.",1,1
"Really great food! A nice variety of hot dogs, toppings, and sauces. They also have burgers and fries.  We ordered a footlong dog, a natural casing dog with bacon, and the home on the range fries. Amazing! The fries were a bit spicer than expected, so we ""had"" to order ice cream. Darn. :)  Overall, a really great little place. I'll be back soon.",1,1
"If you want to relive your misspent youth, or get a flavor of where to go after the sock hop ends, this is the place. Tasty, tasty hot dogs, hamburgers, and the usual sides, plus milkshakes and other desserts. Pull up and order from your car, or sit outside or inside. I often get a hankerin' for a coney dog in the summer, and I really enjoyed the Retro Dog. Hot dog was perfect and a nice soft bun to keep the coney sauce to hot dog ratio just right. The Carolina dog had a flavorful complement of coleslaw for a mellow blend of dog and vegs. Got cheesy bacon fries, which have some heat due to the spicy fries coating. Onion rings were also good. They are also open late when there are events going on at Blossom.",1,1
Good hot dogs. Good root beer. Not a chain. Good times.,1,1
"I was very impressed with RETRO Dog. As an ovo-lacto vegetarian (I eat eggs and dairy products), I am never sure if somewhere that specializes in hot dogs will have any options for me, but RETRO Dog has not one but three vegetarian entrees--a veggie dog, a veggie Italian sausage, and a black bean burger. They also offer veggie chili, veggie coney sauce, and veggie cheese fries.  I had a veggie dog with veggie coney sauce and cole slaw and a side of onion rings. The dog had a pleasant texture and flavor and the toppings were scrumptious. I have tried quite a few veggie dogs in my day and this was definitely one of the best. The onion rings were unlike any other rings I have tried. The batter had an interesting flavor and was not crumbly like many other rings, but it was crisp and delicious. I also enjoyed the zesty sauce that accompanied the rings.  I chose the locally-brewed root beer for my beverage and I was not disappointed. The flavor was mellow and not overly sweet and it was served in a fancy chilled mug.   My dining companions ordered a veggie Italian sausage, a RETRO Dog, a Red Hot, and a couple other meat dogs and everyone was satisfied. We also happened to go on a buy one, get one free hot dog day, which was a pleasant surprise for the pocket book.   We chose to eat inside, rather than utilizing the Swenson's-style carports. They looked fine, if that's your thing. The atmosphere inside is a fun mix of retro kitsch and contemporary. The chairs are surprisingly comfortable and the service was efficient and friendly.   I highly recommend RETRO Dog. I will definitely be returning to sample the rest of the vegetarian delights and specialty sodas.",1,1
"Here to tell you I think this place is off the hook!  I was excited to try it & was not disappointed.  At first I thought they were a little pricey, but put things in perspective.  The ingrediants are of higher quality than you would think.  Went on a Sunday afternoon & it wasn't crowded at all.  Four of us sat at the counter and talked to the friendly staff members the whole time.  I ordered the Chicago dog & really loved it!  Boyfriend got the Carolina dog & he loved it!  The boys got the Coney dogs and wanted more.  Nom, Nom, Nom...  Few things worth noting... I am a designer and I was digging everythig about this place!  The layout, the lighting, the surface materials, the graphic design, etc.  I can really appreciate all of the nice, clean details this place offers.  I even took a pic of the rest room!  A+ to the design team!  They even have nice, thick, soft napkins which were like a luxury!  I want to work here just so I can get a red pair of Converse! Seriously,  I love their uniforms, very cool.  If they sold their shirts I would buy one!  Love the artwork & colors.  Again, well done & kudos to the artist!",1,1
"Overall fantastic place. The decor is very cool and the food is good. Even if you are not a fan of hot dogs, they do have burgers (including a black bean burger!) and chicken options. I had the original retro dog- diced onions, chili, and cheese. It was quite yummy. There was a hint of cinnamon in the chili that I could have done without but it was still delicious! My combo also came with a side of home-style fries which were surprisingly crunchy as well as tasty.   Retro dog also offers a variety of retro sodas- cream soda, black cherry, root beer and so on. The root beer is actually their own recipe and made locally. It was a sweeter take on root beer than most places, so if you like sweet pop, you will definitely be a fan :) plus it comes in a frosted mug, just like all root beer should!  Customer service was fine, seems they have worked out any kinks they may have had since opening earlier this summer. I know I will be going back!",1,1
Loved it since it opened. Everything's great but be sure to ask for your dog ungrilled if you don't like the charring. I like it like that but my kids don't.,1,1
This place is good.  The hot dogs are excellent and the burgers are good.  They seem like decent people and are friendly.  My biggest complaint  is that it is a bit on the expensive side.  We go here fairly regularly.,1,1
"I didn't get a hot dog, but I did get the ice cream sandwich.  I would give just the ice cream sandwich five stars!  The butter pecan and caramel cookie ice cream sandwich was recommended to me by the cashier.  She did not lead me astray.  Two huge cookies with ice cream (which was at least 1.5 inches thick).  I would go back just for that delightful treat.   I also got the chocolate malt, which was very good, but not great.   Everything else looked decent in the pictures, but I did not partake.",1,1
"Nice little ""drive-in"" diner. It's literally in the middle of nowhere but worth the trip. We went on the behest of my brother in law, and couldn't have been more satisfied. Actually ordered a couple hot dogs and the wife got a burger. The meat was seasoned well (pause) and the dogs were grilled perfectly. Ordered the loaded fries (tip: you can go for the regular size portion if sharing with another person, it's plenty!) and was stuffed the rest of the day and we ate there at 5PM. Staff was super friendly and helpful with our order.  Will definitely be back. To get more food, because why not?!",1,1
"What can I say about the food. It's awesome. Great family atmosphere. The onion rings are amazing and even the chicken sandwich is good. But skip that, grab a dog.",1,1
"Even though I planned my weekend in the Akron area around burger joints, beer and baseball, I couldn't pass up a hot dog place so close to my hotel.  You know, just for a snack.  For some reason, I was feeling adventurous that day.  I went against my instincts and, at the recommendation of Liana E, I went with the veggie dog.  I got mine topped simply with just the special mayo mustard.  I also went, of course, with a cup of the locally brewed root beer.  I debated the growler when I saw them on the counter, but it seemed a bit pricey (I think it was $15 for the growler full of root beer).  I took my cup and dog to go, but really just sat outside at one of the tables since it was such a nice day.  I unwrapped my dog and was surprised at it's size - bigger than I expected.  This was going to be more than a snack.  I took a bite.  And instantly my brain thought, ""This doesn't taste like a hot dog.""  Then I remembered, duh, I ordered the veggie dog.  The taste was not unpleasant to my meat-loving sensibilities.  And the special mayo mustard, which I think was just mayo mixed with dijon mustard, had a nice flavor to it.  Though I'm not sure it was the best condiment for the veggie dog.  The root beer was aces.  I still regret not splurging on that growler.  I've vowed to return to the area and I'd like Retro Dog to be part of it.  If I enjoyed the veggie dog so much, I can only imagine how much I'd like the meat hot dogs.  I also saw some amazing looking onion rings I'd like to give a try as well as some tasty looking desserts.  Seems like my kind of place.",1,1
"Great concept.  Food is good-fun menu and terrific custard desserts.  Drive-in service as well as indoor/outdoor seating.  Firepit for cooler nights. Plan on visiting many more times.   Onion rings are fantastic, hot dogs are good, chicken sandwiches are great!",1,1
Eaten here a handful of times. The hot dogs are good. They have nice snap when you bite into them. Burger decent. Nice to go to when your going to or coming back from Blossom. Root beer is good too. Worth a try. Use the coupons you get. I think the prices could be a bit better. But I'm cheap so I don't like to pay a lot for a hot dog. It's just a hot dog... But worth the try to see if you like it. Eat inside. Too messy to eat in your car. But it's cool to eat in your car so if you don't care then go for it.,1,1
"Randomly found this place after a concert at Blossom and overall I enjoyed it.  Service is quick and food is out quickly as well. I like the fact that they bake their own buns, definitely creates a different experience.  Personally, I'm a chili cheese dog man and was sad to see none on the menu. Never had tried a coney dog prior, instinctively I ordered one as well as a Chicago dog. As far as taste goes, it was definitely tasty, just not in the sense that I'm use to. The Chicago dog was excellent and PACKED with overflowing toppings and tasted great!  My SO got a coney dog as well and pretty much shared the same experience. She's a chili cheese dog person too. I know.. we're meant to be together haha.  Fries were fresh and their onion rings were unique and intimidating but definitely delicious! Loved every bite.  And last but not least, their MILKSHAKES. Thick and flavorful, just like a traditional milkshake should be. Chocolatey goodness!!!!  I'd definitely come back again!",1,1
"Traveling through town, we were looking for an inexpensive, quick, unique place for lunch. This is certainly it.  Wonderful hot dogs and great frozen custard. The atmosphere is great but the highlight had to be the onion rings. Wonderful batter, crispy and delicious. Would certainly recommend this place. Our family of 4 ate lunch for about $34 without custard.",1,1
I just loved this place! Neat atmosphere and the entire staff was friendly and helpful! I got the Hula Burger and BLT Fries - loved the hula sauce and burger! The fries were very good too - but next time I'd get the fries with hula sauce on them.   They have very cool ice cream options too! One of cups has a sundae at the bottom and a milk shake poured over it!  I can't wait to take my family here! These kind of burger/hot dog joints are my new favorite places to find!,1,1
"I have never had a negative experience here! Quick service, food is ready quickly, servers are sweet. Cream soda is addicting! The hot dogs and burgers are delish! We have been coming here since they opened. Only thing we have never done is go inside to eat. It's always so fun eating in the car with the kids!! You should eat here!!",1,1
"very good tasting hot dogs, a lot of options for toppings. a little bit more expensive than you'd want just for hot dogs, but the atmosphere is awesome and there's a lot of menu choices. I would recommend.",1,1
Chicago dog was delicious.  My husband had a double cheeseburger was probably the best cheeseburger Ive had in while.,1,1
"My significant other and I have been frequenting this establishment since it opened. We could probably walk there in less than ten minutes. He loves the natural casing hot dogs and I love the Retro burger. Both are an incredible quality at a great price. They also have some of the best seasoned fries around. I throughly enjoy all of their frozen treats as well. They make a frozen custard marble that is amazing, with any topic you can think of, plus their milkshake selection is seriously impressive. I dig the curb side dining experience, and Retrodog is doing it much better than any of the other competitors around. The staff is always sweet, quick and you can tell that they enjoy working there. Great customer service. Oh yeah, and they make homemade root beer that is very good and unique. It's a must try. I'll never go back to a Swensons/Skyway/A&W ever again. The quality of food alone makes them stand out above the competition. IMO they are the number one burger/hotdog/fries experience in the Akron area.",1,1
"This place is great! The white hot (veal/pork) dog is amazing! The shakes are amazing and their hula ghost burger BLEW MY MIND! made with a ghost chili sauce with bacon, grilled onion and pineapple makes for a burger that's out of this world!",1,1
Seriously. Banzai burger. Best I have ever ever had.  Everything at this old school/new school place...reasonable prices and tasty service...,1,1
"I tried this place today and it was really good! I ordered the retro veggie dog and cheese fries. The retro dog was really good it came with chili, mustard and onions. Being an all vegetarian meal I was pretty pleased. The cheese fries were fantastic! Crispy and the cheese was yum! We will be back.",1,1
"Was down in the area for some hiking and remembered seeing some good things about this place. Retro Dog is really in the middle of nowhere which explains why it wasn't so busy but easy enough to get to once you know what streets to take. The car hoppers came out very quick, gave us the extensive menu, and came back out just as quickly when we were ready to order. The shakes were DELICIOUS and the hot dogs were very good too. Good choice of bun as well. The fries with cheese sauce and bacon were also very good.  Overall, my wife and I definitely enjoyed it. We put it right up next to Swenson's as one of our favorite places to go for food. Very good!",1,1
"Did a Hula burger, it was different but pretty good. Onion rings are awesome! Coleslaw was not all that good.",1,1
"Man do I love Retro Dog!! This awesome mom and pop business does not disappoint.      It's a hot dog place, so of course the dogs are wonderful (my favorite is the Carolina) but that doesn't mean you should shy away from the burgers! Whenever I'm really hungry I get a Hula burger. Provolone cheese, lettuce, grilled onions, bacon, and a pineapple slice all doused in this incredible spicy hula sauce. Yum!  Don't forget to save room for custard! Not ice cream, but delicious, creamy custard. There is not a single thing on the desert menu that I wouldn't get.   The service is very friendly and helpful! They genuinely seem to be very happy at this establishment. Not the usual disgruntled employees. The managers are just as wonderful! Always making sure you're happy, and that your visit is a good one.  This place is unlike any other restaurant I've been to, and I always recommend it to anyone who is ever going through that area. I love retro dog!",1,1
This place was great. I don't understand the poor reviews. One of the best hot dogs I've ever had. Milkshake was solid as well.  And the poor waitress braved a monsoon to take our order quickly.   Can't wait to go back.,1,1
"Excellent local restaurant for grilled American fare. The selection of burgers, hot dogs, shakes and fried foods is just incredible. There are also vegetation options (dogs and burgers) which is greatly appreciated! The place is clean and neat, and the service is quick and modernized (they use iPhones to ring you out). One minor issue - the hot dogs and burgers are great, but the buns themselves are either too big or too soggy.  The food is incredible, but a better bun makes a even better sandwich.",1,1
"I can't believe some of the complaints on here! Retro dog is awesome plain and simple, if you don't like something you picked out build your own meal! They offer that. Any who, never have had a bad meal, in fact we drive from North Royalton/Strongsville just to have there food! There hot dogs &&& burgers are to die for, seriously! The prices I don't mind at all either because I work at a family establishment and times are tough and so are soaring prices in the food industry! We love you retro dog!",1,1
"Yes, there is now a White Castle located on the strip in Las Vegas. Everyone who wants to try them without going to the Midwest/East coast can now have a taste of the well known slider. I have enjoyed White Castle before in Chicago and found that they are quite tasty and I can put a few back. My cousin always orders them with extra pickles.  I should have remembered that when eating them in Vegas.  I forgot that tidbit, but they were still really good. I really wish they had a location in Denver.  That would make my year.  The best 2 things about the one on the strip, they are open 24 hours and they sell beer.  What can make this place better? Well, it is also attached to a casino! The place was hoping and cranking out burgers at a rapid rate.  If you haven't tried White Castle, now is your time.",1,1
"Thoroughly enjoyed the Midwest sliders. Freshly made and tasty. Brought back memories from Chicago late night slider runs.  They have onion ""chip"" rather than full onion rings. Think onion rings cut into pieces.  And being Las Vegas, this White Castle serves beer - keep that buzz going!  Friendly staff and a dining room cleaning crew that was constantly keeping the place clean.",1,1
"Very small restaurant capitalizing off the brand's nostalgia and charm. They sell their signature miniature ""slider"" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in.   The restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer.   A large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others.   Last, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect.   My experience was pleasant, but to each their own. For $8.99 you can get 4 Cheese Sliders, a small fry and a small drink. The price is consistent with the glamorization of the branding. I ate each slider in about 2 bites and was still hungry afterwards, but didn't want to face waiting in a long line again.   If you are nearby in the area, take a look!",1,1
More of a nostalgia thing for me growing up in Minneapolis and eating them as a kid.  Price seemed always right and always fresh and delicious.  That thing they do with the onions is over the top.  Not as good a burger as I remember as a kid but maybe I have eaten too many celebrity chef burgers and acquired a different taste.  Hard to park to get there but if you're in the neighborhood pick up a few and enjoy.  Fast and friendly service and smells great.,1,1
"The wait is long, but definitely worth it! I wish there was one in So. Cal so I can have it more often than twice a year. The service is definitely quick and accommodating.",1,1
"Listen folks....White Castle is not for everyone.  If you're curious about these little cooked to order sliders just try one or two at the most. I definitely don't recommend a full meal.  Vegas location means Vegas prices. It may not be worth it to you. Now for all the lovers & fans of this tasty little spot..... be prepared for greatness! Its always super busy here which is assurance that everything is fresh, hot, & ready to go. They ppl here a great system to get you in & out. You can even see them cooked the burgers, grill the onions, & steam the buns while placing your order....but i must warn you...be prepared to pay Vegas prices. Hope this helps!",1,1
First of all this opened 15 hours ago. The wait was not that long considering I ordered a crate w/cheese (100 sliders w/cheese). The manager maintained eye contact with everyone on line (less than 20 people at 530am). I seen over 400 burgers leave in the 15 minutes I was there. The place was clean and I could not smell smoke (it's inside a casino).,1,1
"Cute little burgers. Good ratio of onions and pickles. Kind of wish it had already come with ketchup or mayo inside. I guess this place is really only for those who know what to expect. If not, kind of setting yourself up for failure.",1,1
"I like this place. The workers have great customer service and their services are fast. I seen a couple complaints that this place is similar to the frozen stuff.  Um.. yeah... shouldnt it be??  If i owned a restaurant and decided to sell my food to the grocery stores, i would want it to taste like it was the same as dining in.   Las Vegas is a tourists city and I'm very grateful for restaurants from around the world to land here.  It's very welcoming for those that moved out here and miss what they grew up with.",1,1
I agree with most people that White Castle is a bit overrated.  The fries are akin to the ones you got in grade school cafeterias.  The sliders are tasty.  The service was good.  We came by at 11am on a Monday and ordered a 10 slider pack.  There was only one couple in front of us but we got our food within a minute after ordering.,1,1
Oh my...  As a person who has at times struggled with weight I have to say that going to the Las Vegas White Castle location was the biggest boost of self confidence.  The average circumference of the people that were there to eat was over the morbidly obese range...one guy had a gut that was drooping over his shorts.  And I saw a few order the 100 burger box...I actually couldn't help myself but stare several times...I felt instant guilt and wondered how many children in the Philippines were hungry  I liked the burgers but after seeing what can't be unseen...I won't be going back and I'll be heading to church to pray and to the gym to run,1,1
This place is great for a late night drink food run. The line can be long but is worth it. If you do come with a large group order the large pack.,1,1
"I turned the corner and there it was--HOLY SQUARE BURGERS, ITS WHITE CASTLE!  Been living in Washington for almost 20 years now and when I saw that blue and white--ITS WHITE CASTLE!  I know when I walk through the pearly gates, right next to the NY Pizza place will be a White Castle!",1,1
"First time trying this burger joint and it didn't disappoint us.  For a family of 3, it was me, my wife & our 3 year old, i ordered the 4 cheeseburger sliders combo and extra 2 cheeseburger slider. I thought it was enough for us, but I had to order a few more lol.  For me its best to eatitwhen it is still warm, everything just melts in ur mouth, and im craving for it right now again while writing this review.  I ordered a $5 chocolate shake too and that was also good!  Their service is really fast and food quality is great, that is why for me, they deserve a 5-star rating.  At the time that we were there, there was a good amount of people.  When I paid for my food they gave me a number, i went to go get my drink, a minute or two after, they called my number right away, so i was very satisfied.  Its a small dining area, so It might be a little hard for you if you come here when there is a lot of people.  When I come back to Vegas, I would definitely come back here.",1,1
"11 years! That's how long it has been since Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about these tiny burgers, and how long I have been waiting to find out if it was worth it.  Spoiler: It kind of is.  The meat is really nothing special here.  It looks preformed from frozen (I could be wrong, but just my observation) and it very thin.  What makes this joint stand out is everything else in addition to the location.  The burgers grill on a flat top coated with onions to soak in flavor.  They are simply made with a couple leftover onions and a pickle, plus cheese if you pay extra.  No frills needed, or really requested for that matter.  The other options I tried were pretty basic type fast food, so nothing special I would go back for.  This location is 24/7 right on the Vegas strip and whether it was noon after a night of drinking, or 4am during a night of drinking - this place is gold! 4 bite burgers that are pretty cheap, freshly made in front of you and aren't super heavy.  I chowed down on 5 of them easily feeling satisfied without feeling sick the next day or really even feeling regret from eating anything overly greasy or poor quality.  In a regular fast food setting it would be just that to me.  A quick bite when I don't really care about what I'm eating the way most fast food is.  On the Vegas strip however, this is probably my new favorite stop during the night or before I get some sleep!",1,1
"I've always wanted to try a White Castle and this is the only place in western US.  The burgers are more like small sliders, so order a few of them. They come with pickles and grilled onions, but they are very tasty!  I also ordered 'onion chips'; Its like onion rings but in French fry form. They are really good.  The service was quick, the prices were reasonable (considering it's on the strip). I would definitely come back.",1,1
"I've been wanting to try this place WAY before Harold & Kumar made it cool. I was pretty excited to hear that one opened up in Vegas. I've had friends who've gone to New York & eat it & they basically told me ""What you see, is what you get.""   True to word. I wasn't disappointed though. The line was ridiculous but it went by fast. We ordered almost everything on the menu & it was done pretty quick. The cheeseburgers were pretty good, the fries were lame, the onion chips WERE DELISH, the chicken rings were okay.  I mean, its a fast food place - I don't know what people were really expecting.. lol.",1,1
"We drive up from the Phoenix area for White Castle. Husband is a WC freak! I grew up in No Cal, so I only knew from the movies. ;) He says they are far better than the microwave / grocery store heat and eat. We did a drive across the good ol' USA last summer (from coast to coast) and I honestly can't tell the difference between Las Vegas and St Louis. Which is a good thing. They taste the same here as they did on the East Coast.",1,1
"College at Ohio State and these things were a regular food item for us. I haven't had a ""fresh"" one in 15 years! These were the highlight of my trip to Vegas. Are they kinda crappy? Yes, but if you're from Ohio you get it. You know why we love them. The atmosphere isn't so great, homeless walking up to you asking for money is a bit of a downer when you're relishing your first bite in over a century but it's Vegas, so whatever.",1,1
I never heard of White Castle till I watched Harold and Kumar. It never dawned to me till I seen it while in Vegas. The line gets really long (which is normal on the Strip). They are small portions so get a few.  It is kinda pricey but I thought it was really good. I would choose White Castle over Innout any day now..,1,1
"White Castle burgers give you the munchies without smoking pot. I grew up with White Castle burgers and I love them. They are unique. They do not taste like any other burgers you may have eaten. They are 'steam' grilled and this gives them a unique flavor and texture.   If you go to White Castle with any kind of preconceived notions of what a burger is supposed to taste like, you will be disappointed. This is where the negative reviews come from; people who are going to White Castle for the first time who are expecting something different. All I can tell these people is that, unless you've grown up with White Castle burgers, they are an acquired taste. They are the caviar of fast food burgers.  You may not like White Castle burgers the first time you try them. But, after you eat them few times, you'll wake up at 3 a.m. some night and find yourself craving them. Those of us who grew up with them understand this. As I said, White Castle burgers give you the munchies without smoking pot.",1,1
Oh I love you White Castle! The most amazing place. Only in Vegas can you get a 6 pack of burgers and beer! Sweet combo! I'll be back very soon!,1,1
"So you're drunk on the Strip and you want that delicious but poor food choice. Yep White Castle fits the bill. The sliders are little bites of heaven which do a great job coating your alcohol laden belly. Being originally from Detroit there was a White Castle on every corner so it wasn't an urgent run to try them when they arrived on the Strip. Being drunk and at Harrah's seeing the White Castle was like a beacon calling us over. The place was packed as we weren't the only ones with the same brilliant idea. The cashiers do a pretty efficient job filling all the orders as quick as possible so expect to wait 15 minutes on a busy weekend night. 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a pop (dammit I'm from Michigan and it's POP not soda) will set you back $8.99 but the extra space it soaks up for more alcohol consumption is priceless. Thank you White Castle!",1,1
"Well, well, well-- another burger joint in Vegas. And guess what? It's affordable, especially after an intense session at the slots or tables! Or if you had ''too much fun'' at the clubs.  Location: This burger hot spot is located near the Linq, across from Mirage-- it's literally next to ""Margaritaville'' or whatever. But definitely easy to spot (look for the castle structure sign).  Interior: This is a typical fast food joint. Need I say more?  Food: The burgers were pretty small. Being a Hefty Hannah that I am (inside and out), 5 burgers & fries would probably fill me up. I kid you not, I could probably fit 2-3 burgers in the palm of my hand. Compared to Shake Shack & In n Out -- this place is.... different. If you're into small & soft burgers-- this is the place for you. Also, I really like how the cheese is always melted in the burger (that's total perfection). However, the squiggly fries were ""eh."" Same with the chicken rings-- I could pass on both and stick with the CHEESEBURGERS. Oh, and be sure to ask for the sauces with your burgers-- it definitely makes for an exciting twist. Between the other burger spots, I would choose this place because it's one of those, hashtag cheap eats -- and bragging rights of ""OMG, I ate 10 burgers!""  Service:  It was alright. Nothing to complain about.  TLDR: This place is great for cheap burgers-- comparable to McDonalds, but better. in flavor and MELTED CHEESE! Burgers are small, so order A LOT (5-6 per person).   Turn Ons: - Cheap - Melted cheese - Super small KAWAIIIII burgers - Sauces - Opens 24/7 (I think...).  Turn Offs: - Fries & Chicken rings (ew)",1,1
"I'm a native new yorker and this couldn't be better I gave missed this, onion rings look different but it all remains me of home . thank you",1,1
"After years of eating the frozen burgers from the grocery store, I finally got to try them in person in a real location. I'll be honest, these are not the best burgers I've ever had - nor are they best sliders either. But hey, they're tasty and they get the job done. They're pricey but that's common in Vegas, but I must say the sliders with cheese are delicious. Their chicken rings, yes ""RINGS"" are delicious as well. So if you find yourself nearby while walking the strip and need either a small snack or full meal, try it.  It's not the best burger in town, but it's a tasty for what it is.",1,1
"Ok if you are DRUNK, HUNGOVER, OR GONNA BE.  These rock.  If not they are kinda grease pits that sit in your gut.  My friends had issues with the onions I did not.",1,1
"My bf is from the east coast and was beyond excited when news broke of a White Castle coming to Vegas. Being from California my heart belongs to in n out. That being said, their sliders are pretty good for the price. The sliders are on a soft pillowy bun with grilled onions and pickles with the option of cheese.  We received a text 3 days before the official opening date stating that White Castle was giving away free food. Within minutes we were out the door and made the 20 minute drive to the strip.  When we got there, there was caution tape preventing us to enter the restaurant from the casino, but we were able to see the entire restaurant. We saw kitchen staff making sliders and contractors making finishing touches. We figured that they would give away all the sliders they were practicing to make for the grand opening. After being told that they were only giving them to casino employees we decided to hang out for 45 minutes hoping for the chance they would have extra for us. We even offer to pay for them.  The patience paid off and we went home with 14 sliders and fries for free!  The customer service was amazing. Curious casino patrons would peek into the White Castle and sure enough an employee would come over to answer questions and encourage them to come back in a few days when they officially open.   They open Tue, Jan. 27th at 2pm!",1,1
"This was my first White Castle experience.  I had tried the frozen ones before and didn't care for them and was assured by many that I had to try the real thing.    I was excited that White Castle had opened in Vegas since it was more likely that I would make it to Vegas than the east coast.  Final the Vegas trip was booked and I was excited to try out White Castle.    Flash forward to Sunday morning.  The breakfast debate begins and me and my home skillet decide on White Castle.  Since its Vegas it's open 24/7 so why not!  White Castle is located on the strip in the Casino Royale.  The store front is located on the strip and easy to find.    As you walk in it feels like any fast food restaurant.  Ordering was quick, easy and friendly.  We ordered the 2 person combo with 10 sliders (5 with cheese, 5 original), a fry, an onion chip and two soda's for a little over $20.  Our order was up pretty quick.  They do require you show your receipt when you pick up your order.  I'm sure this is a safety measure as I can imagine as day turns to night and the party animals are on the loose there has been previous burger burglaries.    The moment has arrived the tiny little boxes of meat onions and bread is before me!  I take my first bite and.....it's alright.  I figure it's a east coast thing.  I'll stick to my my west coast In n' Out.  The restaurant itself was good, I can't blame them for my taste buds being born and raised on the west coast.   Moral of the story.....try it, you might like it, even if I didn't!",1,1
They are what they are - greasy little piles of goodness.  The pickle and cardboard box adds the missing pieces that the frozen ones can not provide.  If you grew up with them then you know what I'm talking about.  For first timers they probably won't be to your liking and that's fine too.   Cut down on the fat by removing the bottom bun.  It soaks up the majority of the fat.,1,1
"I first had the honor of noshing on these edible miracles, while attending the U or MN (Twin Cities), beginning in 1969 (Sliders were 12Â¢/each, then).  I had a ""dry spell"" (living W of the Mississippi River) until I visited NYC in 1976.  Since then, none.  Now, it's like a prayer has been answered in my favor, and I can once again re-live my college days, even though I am now 65 and can't down the 20 I used to put away at a single visit in the 1970s.  I have a friend in Meadview AZ who's more ""addicted"" to them than I am, so if he has HIS way, I'm sure he'll be traveling the 218 round-trip miles every weekend, and crying when that's not possible.  While I'm glad they have finally opened an outlet in the Las Vegas Valley, I only have one question regarding that:  WHY didn't you open one here, in the 1970s?",1,1
"I'm not sure why the bad reviews. I mean it's not the best burger I ever had,but it is pretty tasty. Doesn't taste anything like the microwaved version of the chain. For what it is it does the job. It's a little pricey but I would eat it again next time I'm in town.",1,1
"I finally made it to White Castle! Located on the busy strip of Las Vegas, the only White Castle on the West Coast(ish). This small shop is located next to the Harrah's on the east side of a small casino. As you may already know, parking on the strip (if you are coming from off the strip) is a pain in the butt, but if you are coming just to have White Castle I would choose a hotel/casino near the Harrah's.  The restaurant is pretty small and narrow. Once you walk in there are a few tables including one really long table with seats on both sides of the table. The counter is in the back of the restaurant. The menu is pretty basic; there are a few combos that include the sliders, fries and a drink, sliders that are being sold by themselves and also options to order large amounts of sliders!   We ordered a regular combo, but added a few more sliders to our order. They came out quick and hot... and they tasted just like I imagined a fresh White Castle Slider would taste like... my childhood nostalgia. I easily packed away like 7 sliders without blinking, but boy do you pay for it later.  I have friends that have visited the Midwest and told me that White Castle was delicious, but gives you gnarly gas... and boy does it! You have been warned.",1,1
"Ahhhh a familiar taste! This is the only location in Vegas! I am glad they have one from where I from (St Louis) they have them everywhere! I have read some of the reviews and I must laugh at some, this place is not a five star burger place, they are called ""Belly bombers"" for a reason! They a quick snack food and great late late at night or early am, or beating a rough night before. I LOVE white castles and will continue to go back they are great and I am glad to have them in town!!!",1,1
I have been a loyal customer of Freshmart for the last few years. I just noticed that they have filled the void created by the closure of European Quality Meats and Sausages. Freshmart now carries their full line of products. The only difference their meat counter is self service. You don't have to take a number and wait. As to their prices they have without question the cheapest prices in the area.,1,1
"The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art is small and in any other big city, $15 for a well presented, but small Monet exhibition might not be worth the time or expense. Yet after walking up and down the Strip for a couple hours and repeatedly reminding myself of why I'm not a Las Vegas type of guy, this Gallery was a welcome and peaceful respite. With the audio guide in my ear, I enjoyed the overwrought explanations and wandered back and forth as I actually tried to learn something. It was an enjoyable time, and I was actually sorry that I had to go back and brave the happy hordes again.",1,1
"A touch of true (not manufactured) French impressionist art in Las Vegas. This city keeps on pleasantly surprising me.   The Monet exhibition is on view through January 6, 2013. This exhibition showcased 20 works by Monet and eight other works by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Camille Pissarro, and Eugene Louis Boudin.  February 2013 onwards we can look forward to a Warhol series.   The gallery itself is pretty compact, the audio aids provided are quite easy to use and the gallery doesn't seem to get too crowded to allow enjoyment of these exquisite works. Although I have to mention that the audio provided quite a lot of useless information rather than descriptions of the art work and the artists.   Strangely enough, in addition to the gorgeous art, I was drawn to the walls of the studio that were painted a stunning purple!  The cost of a ticket here is around $16 for adults ($13 for locals) and children under 12 are free. Pretty reasonable for a priceless experience.   It's nice to partake in these creative gems without taking an international flight. If only this were a little bit bigger....think the Art Institute of Chicago maybe? We did Smith Center...now for a large museum (that's not mob related) Vegas!",1,1
"Bellagio prides itself on being one of the best luxury casinos on the Vegas strip thus I promptly expected it's art gallery to be up to par. I came to Vegas for the 4th of July weekend and noticed that they just recently opened a Picasso exhibit titled Creatures and Creativity. I was extremely intrigued and wanted to visit. However, it was far too crowded. I came back to Vegas about a month later when it was far less crowded and came by the gallery.   I like to think of myself as a modern art aficionado; I am especially fond of Rothko and color blocking  which is very different from Picasso's style. However, this exhibit boasted 43 works and regardless of whatever modern art movement you prefer this exhibit will not fail to impress. This collection contained a series of works inspired by his wife Jacqueline. The whole exhibit will give you a deeper appreciation of Braques and his cubist movement. I can't recommend this gallery enough. Go to it to take a break from all the slot machines and general chaos found in Vegas. Enjoy.",1,1
"We went here with some friends for the Picasso exhibit and it was great. They have an interactive headset feature where as you walk around you can hear a short story and description of each of the beautiful paintings as you are in front of them. The staff could be a bit more ""customer service"" oriented but I guess standing around all day staring at the same paintings does get to you after a while. It does provide a great history of his personal life and his inspirations for each of his works of art.",1,1
"I like the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts, enough that I renewed my annual membership today.  I don't go as often as I should but I can and will--well not if history is my guide.  I know the space is small and I realize they charge too much for admission given that fact.  The audio tour wand included with the admission is almost worth the admission price.  The current exhibit--A Sense of Place:Landscapes from Monet to Hockney is small with a limited number of paintings and other art.  The quality, however, is excellent.  Many of the pieces are on loan from The Boston Museum of Fine Arts.  Some are from the Contemporary Museum in San Diego, and a few pieces are from the MGM Resorts collection.  I didn't have all that much time today, so I did the audio tour and moved quickly through the exhibition.  Since I have the membership for a year, I can go back another time and spend more time studying the individual works and learning more about the artists.  Again, I know the place is small, but at least we have a fine arts gallery.  With the Guggenheim closing and the West Sahara Library Museum closed, we need something like the BGFA.  It is worth having.",1,1
"Great exhibition of Monet's work. it's a little small, but then again it is an exhibition gallery and not a museum. It's fair priced and the atmosphere is great. The staff is very friendly and seem well educated on the matter. Lastly, a complementary audio guide is given to you as you access the Gallery providing some information and a little background of art on display.",1,1
"Before I start the review, I wanted to address the biggest complaint I read here: The size of the gallery and the number of artworks here.  This in itself raises an interesting question.  What is the ""value"" and ""worth"" of admission of an art exhibit to a person?  Do 3 paintings justify the price?  30 paintings?  Do the artists showcased play a factor?  Granted, I took advantage of a ""Free Admission"" day, so I didn't pay the requisite $15 dollars.  It's only 4 rooms, so it took less than an hour to complete, but I did see some beautiful pieces there from the ""Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form"" exhibit.  Some from Lichtenstein, and Nara, and Picasso, Degas, and Renoir.  Certainly, viewing the works of these artists has to be worth something.  And it's not like the gallery doesn't change its exhibit at least twice a year.  The staff was friendly enough and didn't follow you room to room; an issue that I had at another (now closed) museum here.  There are locals and student discounts.  It comes with a free audio tour.  So what is the price of viewing art worth to you?  If you like the artists and get a chance to see their works in person, shouldn't that be at least worth some value to yourself?  I've been to bigger and admittedly better museums, but I did enjoy my time here.  When the exhibits change, I'd be glad to come back.  And yes, I'd actually be fine in paying to do so.",1,1
Wanted to see the Farbege exhibit. Student and resident discount  Smaller than most exhibit I've been to but it's always fun to see history.  A bit of a walk from lobby but the hotel is beautifully done.,1,1
"I'm a bonafide art lover who lives in the art wasteland that is Las Vegas, so I'm super happy and grateful that the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art exists in our town. I support it every chance I get and I never miss an exhibition. The exhibitions change only a couple of times per year so make sure you call to find out what's currently on display.  I love that a free audio tour is included with your admission. Make sure you pick it up because it's very informative. The gallery itself is super tiny. Even if you are expecting the small size, you'll still be disappointed. The exhibits only have a few pieces on display but it's better than nothing. The curator here is big on having a certain theme or artist on display for each exhibition. We've had Monet, Warhol and more general themes like Women Painters. Allow 30 minutes to an hour to view the exhibit. You won't need more time than that.   The museum offers a local's discount certain days of the month. It changes so call ahead, but tickets are reduced in price from $13 to $8. The gallery has monthly wine discussions in the gallery too where you enjoy wine pairings and talk about the art for around $40 per ticket. Photography is NOT allowed in the gallery.",1,1
"My husband and I went to see the Warhol Out West exhibit, as I am a big fan of Andy Warhol. While it is a small gallery, and a bit pricey for the size, I loved the pieces chosen to be part of this collection. They had his famous Campbell's soup cans, self-portraits, American Indians, snapshots, moving installations, and a few diamond dust pieces -- all-encompassing of this amazing artist's different works. I loved all 45 minutes of my audio tour as well. I recommend it to those who appreciate and love Andy Warhol and would enjoy a refreshing activity outside from typical Vegas madness.",1,1
"Whether or not this is worth the price of admission depends a lot on the current exhibit and how big a fan you are of that art.  When I visited, they were displaying works (mostly) by Monet which were loaned by the Boston Museum of Art.  This is actually the second time I've seen this exhibit in Vegas, although they had different paintings each time.  The first time, about 7 years ago, was the first time I had seen Monet's paintings in person and I was blown away.  This time, although I've now seen his works in Seattle and in Paris, I was still pretty happy with the exhibit.  The only disappointment was that they didn't have any of my favorite pieces.  The space is large enough to feel like you aren't caught in a crowd, small enough that you can see everything in a reasonable amount of time, and the audio guide worked well.  If you're up for a little culture with your vacation of sin, and the gallery is showing something you're interested in, it's definitely worth stopping by!",1,1
"As a huge Warhol fan, I was pleasantly surprised at what this exhibit had to offer.  Small but a well rounded display of all that is Andy Warhol.  The polaroids being my favorite part.  I also appreciated the free phone gadgets that explained in detail the background of each piece.    Being an Art major and from an area that offers maybe a little too much culture (Washington, D.C.)..  Little gems like this make me so happy.  I missed the Monet exhibit but will be back for future displays.  Oh, and the local discount was cool, too!  If only they served wine and/or champagne.  Didn't they get the memo that wine and art are a killer combo?  :)  **Please note:  Absolutely NO photography is allowed.  Andy Warhol never allowed photography even if it was taken without a flash. So BGFA respectively made sure to follow his wishes.",1,1
"Small but fabulous gallery.  Favorites include Eugene Louis Boudin's "" Venice, Santa Maria della Salute from San Giorgio"" and David Hockney's ""Garrowby Hill"".  A must-see if you're on the Strip!",1,1
"First it should be said that this is an art gallery in a casino.  While it may seem an odd note to begin with, it seems that many people have a few overblown expectations about it.  With that out of the way, the gallery itself is a small, four-room affair, with a very silent feel to it.  The exhibits are arranged in number order to correspond with the free audio tour wand, which has an explanation of a few of the things to look for at the piece.  The gallery changes themes about twice a year, and is actually quite well-curated.  Rather than being a giant art gallery, it has more of the feel of a small artist's gallery, and is themed as such.    The only thing holding me back from a 5-star review is the price.  It is simply too expensive for many people out there, and a lot of them will feel cheated for the money.  At a stout $15 per person, it can seem a bit pricey, especially with places like the Met at NYC can be entered for a mere $5.    I think that this gallery is to be relegated to being a locals gallery, since they can get a discount (even more for students), and it is one of a very small set of galleries in the Las Vegas area.  This being a casino, each part must make money, and I guess the only way that the BGFA can do so is through exorbitant prices.",1,1
"Always consistent. I've been here several times for different exhibitions. Intimate, quaint and a nice alternative in Vegas.",1,1
"This gallery is beautiful! As an art history major finding this hidden gem was just amazing. I wouldn't expect anything less from the Balagio.   I was lucky to be in town for the Picasso installation, and we're talking before Picasso got into cubism Picasso, which I personally believe to be the best from him. They had beautiful pencil portraits of his and I just couldn't believe how remarkable they were. Such excellent quality. I also enjoyed that even though this gallery is small, there isn't a lot of people in it all at once so you can take your time with all the art and people won't stand in your way to see them.",1,1
"Totally worth it if you love art and need a bit of culture in your Vegas trip. The exhibit area is not large, so don't be expecting a big museum. We saw the Painting Women exhibit and it was very nice, lots of great paintings and some artists I had never seen before but will be looking into when I get home. I think it was about $20 a person, expensive but not for Las Vegas--everything's expensive here!",1,1
"I was interested in coming here because they were exhibiting works by Picasso. I think Picasso's work is pretty cool.  This a headset guided tour. I guess you can just walk around if you want, but I highly suggest experiencing this in they way they've set it up.  There was plenty of information given in Picasso's artistic processes as well as details on his love and personal life.  Be aware that there are no photos allowed to be taken.    If you are an artist you will gain new knowledge on different techniques and I'm sure become inspired.  For the art lover like me, you too will be pleased.    I should note that this was an extremely short art exhibit so you may not be so happy with that. For $19.00 and being held inside the Bellagio I guess this was reasonably priced. At a larger museum this probably would have been an exhibit add on for around $10.00.  Me and my husband got in for free using My Vegas points so you can try that too.",1,1
"I had gone to the Monet gallery and wanted to return when they got a new artist in, although it is small and doesn't take long to go through, I found it interesting and decently priced. When I had heard that Andy Warhol art was coming into the space I was excited to go check it out. I enjoyed seeing both galleries, but I would say I spent more time in Monet. It held my attention a little better and was all around just more interesting to me. I think everyone is different and some people might think vise versa of my opinion and I can see that, but I would definitely recommend going to check out the gallery no matter what art is being displayed. Its a great locals night out (dinner, gallery, drinks) and something nice for tourists to do too, to get away from all the gambling, smoking, and drinking (even if it is only for an hour or so).  Hours: 10a-8p  Prices: GA $16 Local $13",1,1
"The Picasso exhibit was a nice distraction from the Vegas craziness. We went early afternoon on a Thursday and there wasn't much of a crowd inside. We were able to enjoy the exhibit without feeling rushed and the audio guide helped a lot.   The exhibit seemed a lot smaller than the advertised amount, only because some of the paintings were part of a series and it showed the same piece develop over time.   They offered a discount for M life members and at $16, it was was a great break from the craps table.",1,1
"***************************** 1363 ***************************     Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art is small gallery located right across the Bellagio Pool. $18 ticket but if you are M Life Platinum/Noir member like me, you got 2 free tickets :-)     This time it was the Pablo Picasso private collection from his son. Picasso: Creatures and Creativity - On display July 3, 2015 - January 10, 2016. The exhibition features over 45 of Picasso's paintings, linocuts and lithographs spanning the 1930s - 1970s. These works showcase Picasso's extraordinary ability to capture the human form with his use of line, movement and color. Highlighting his ability to create portraits that vary from realism to the highly abstract, the exhibition reveals Picasso's evolution as an artist over a 40-year span.     It was quite amazing to see the different from one to another right next to each other.      A few things you are not allowed to do here, unlike other museum where you are allowed to take photos with no flash, not here.   - Strollers are not permitted in the Gallery. - Food, drinks, videotaping and photography of any kind are not permitted in the Gallery. - Use of cellular devices is prohibited.",1,1
"We spent about an hour walking through here to see Picasso's paintings, lithographs, and linocuts. It's a small exhibit, which really encourages you to just walk through and listen to each clip of the audio tour (which I typically never do in larger installations). I didn't know much about Picasso aside from his more popular paintings, so to learn about his lithographs/linocuts, was really intriguing. A linocut is like a giant stamp. Picasso would create entire series off of one linocut, which he would stamp once, then cut into and stamp again. Repeat. In one way, it's a bit heart-breaking to know that he just had the one linocut, vs having dozens of them to show the series..but that's kind of what makes it really beautiful.",1,1
"It's nice to see some genuine culture amidst the tacky bling of most of the trip. I saw an exhibit titled ""Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form"". The cost was $12 for locals and included an informative audio tour. It led you through 4 rooms filled with paintings, sketches, mixed media and photographs, including pieces by Picasso and Renior as well as more modern artists. True, the museum is modest, but I thoroughly enjoyed this display.",1,1
"I really love this bit of culture driven by the finest absolutely priceless art hidden in the back of the Bellagio. Most never make the trek down the long hallways to get there. But, if you appreciate some of the world's finest art, along with an incredible adjective and adverb filled audio guide pulled from the largest thesaurus available, I'd really advise coming here.   Once, we were lucky enough to take in an Andy Warhol exhibit. It was incredible! Pop art didn't exist before Andy's era. Wow!  Another time, we saw a Alexander Calder exhibit. Did you know he invented the mobile? In other words, before Alexander Calder, nobody on the planet had conceived of creating hanging sculptures that move in the slightest breeze! These kinetic art forms now grace toddlers cribs, enormous atriums, airports, and wonderful spaces the world over! They even had his one true transitional work, where the mobile was hanging within a traditional picture frame. He then broke from the confines of a frame and centuries of art history and moved his art in to the open where it could rotate, move and be seen from all angles. Truly inspiring!",1,1
Just saw the Faberge' exhibit. The art and stories were fascinating. The exhibit hall is beautiful and the staff friendly. The docent was very knowledgeable. We were excited to see this because our daughter is leaving for Moscow for 16 months. The price is reasonable for locals and students.,1,1
"The Faberge Revealed exhibit at the Bellagio Fine Art Gallery is not to be missed if you enjoy exquisite craftsmanship. The exhibit showcases over 200 artifacts from Karl Faberge and other jewelers from Russia. This traveling exhibit on loan from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is amazing and will be in Las Vegas until May, 2015. The exhibit features four Imperial Easter eggs. The eggs demonstrate the intricacy of the exceptional design and artistry. Also included are Faux, Faberge look alike objects that have been available over the years.",1,1
"Last month I went to see the Claude Monet's Impression of Light exhibit. And I was so delighted to be there. The gallery is small and compact but right to the point. It was a very intimate experience. The audio tour was also very nicely done, not too much information but just enough for you to get a good understanding of the painting. I can't wait to see what the gallery has to offer next time I come back to Vegas",1,1
"We came to see the Picasso exhibit. There weren't many works but it was beautiful, I highly recommend to get the audio tour (it's free). The gallery is not kid friendly nor stroller friendly. It's small and I don't think there was proper security. We got tickets from the MGM hotel special ""3 attractions for $57.""",1,1
"The largest collection of Monet art on display outside of Paris!!!!  (at Bellagio through January 6, 2013)  We just happened to stumble upon a poster advertising this Monet exhibit. How lucky was I since Claude Monet has been my favorite painter ever since I was first introduced to his work in 2nd grade!!! You bet I was freakin excited! (Especially since I've never been to Europe so I have yet to see his most famous works...so far I have only been able to see only a handful of his original pieces).  The gallery is open until 8 pm, with last admission at 7:30 pm. We allowed ourselves a good hour to spend in the gallery. The tickets were reasonably priced: $11 for students, $16 for general adults. Though the gallery was small and comprised of about 4 rooms, there were probably at least 20 paintings on display.  We were told they were on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. There is a complimentary audio tour but I personally declined the option, so I cannot give much feedback on that.  I was slightly disappointed that not all of the works were by Monet, though it was still nice to see some variety (other works included those by Boudin, Pissarro, and Corot).  They showcased a lovely selection of both famous and less-known Monet pieces. However, they did not have any water lilies or Japanese bridge, which I would have loved to see.  Some of my favorites from the gallery were:  Grainstack (sunset) Meadow with Haystacks near Giverny Meadow with Poplars Antibes Seen from the Plateau Notre-Dame Charing Cross Bridge (overcast day) Entrance to the Village of Vetheuil in Winter  There are a couple of security guards, as one would expect. But I was pleasantly surprised (and most appreciative!!) that they did not reprimand me when I peered fairly closely at each painting (framed behind glass) to view the intricate textures and brushstrokes, which I have unfortunately experienced in the past at another museum.  A superb exhibit -- if you are you a Monet fan, you mustn't miss this! The orchid-colored gallery walls really set the mood and complemented the art.  THANK YOU, BELLAGIO!! =)",1,1
very nice! We saw a very well put together exhibit with very famous and not as famous art. well worth it!!! There were families there but parents were carefully & respectfully educating the children on the att.,1,1
"The Bellagio's Gallery of Fine Arts is one of those visits that you need to make whether if you're local or a visitor.  Reading the reviews on Yelp is very helpful before visiting BGFA.  And if you're reading this now, you passed step one.  BGFA looks like a fairly sized exhibit on the outside, but don't let that fool you.  A couple of steps inside and you're wowed with the fact that BGFA is small.  This was my thoughts the first time I've ever visited BGFA.  Prices for the exhibit is about $15 (current exhibit is $16).  There's local nights which is half price, which is big deal. Once you're in you're given an audio hand-held and can tour BGFA at your own pace.  I've been here for the Monet Exhibit, which I thought was fantastic.  I loved it and even paid the full price because I forgot locals get discounts.  My most recent visit was Andy Warhol's exhibit and this time got in during Local's night.  Regarding the Andy Warhol exhibit itself, it's really not for everyone.  You have to be a fan of Warhol to love this exhibit.  And even if you're a huge fan, you need to keep in mind that only a select pieces of his artwork is displayed here. In other words, your favorite pieces may or may not be on display.  I once dated someone that was a huge fan so you can say I was forced to love some of his work.    PS: When you exit, don't forget to stop by Jeff Mitchum's Gallery.  His work is on display or you can review his books that showcase his art. Some comfortable seating too.",1,1
"It's a small museum, but every time I've been here I've been impressed by how well organized the exhibit is.  It is worth the money.  As others have said, this is not an all day experience.  But if you want to get some culture to balance out the debauchery of vegas, this is the place to do it.",1,1
"One of the best art exhibits I have ever seen was an O'Keeffe Stieglitz presentation here; it was so personal and detailed.  Really an in depth gorgeous experience.  This was a few years ago.    This time it was an exhibit on the human form.  Although it was much much smaller than the O'Keeffe exhibit it was nicely put together with notable pieces from Renoir, Picasso, Hockney all the way to a Cindy Sherman photograph.  Good variety, but small.  This is one of my favorite places to go in Vegas and will go every time I visit; LOVE IT!  P.S. It is so f-ing LAME people complain about the price- morons!  It costs $15 for a sandwich on the strip and 3 seconds to loose $15 gambling STFU!",1,1
"I hear that they also have other attractions in Vegas, like gaming.  And shopping, and fabulous restaurants, and pools with plenty of sunshine.  However, my primary reason for visiting Vegas is the art. I first attended the Impressionist show at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art about five years ago, and was duly impressed and surprised by the scholarship and selection of the work.  As a former museum professional, it made sense that Vegas would have the money to pay for the crating, insurance, and exhibition of priceless works of art.  Having worked at a major Modern art museum, it was also a pleasant surprise to use the audio tour to hear the level of scholarship that was available to the casual art viewer.  I have seen every show at the gallery since the first show. My first stop in Vegas is this gallery, now that the Guggenheim branch at the Venetian is closed.  I do, however, miss the voice overs of the likes of Jeremy Irons on the audio tours that the Guggenheim used to feature.  There is nothing like well-written art scholarship read with passionate restraint.   One of my particular favorite shows was on Early Modernism in America, from the vital beginnings of Post World War II art in New York, and featured an array of works that must have been hard to locate and assemble.  The exhibitions here, although limited because of the gallery size, are focused and sophisticated.  I do use either the teacher, or local discount for admission, so it reduces the price.  However, as an art history teacher, I have had to buy museum memberships in order to see large shows at major museums, not to mention the added costs of parking and transportation to reach destination cities.   This small, easily accessible gallery is ideal.  This gallery also accomplishes the egalitarian task of displaying work to everyone, not just the art lover who takes the time to visit a museum. These shows are well worth the price of admission for an hour or so in the company of cultural artifacts that represent the highest aspirations of mankind.  The book store also has some unique, scholarly books that feature the work shown in the gallery, so a visit there after the show is always rewarding.",1,1
"Saw the Andy Warhol Wild West Exhibit here and it was so cool!  Ive seen his other work at the MoMA in NYC and those were also rad. The work shown here, however, is probably not as popular to the public as those shown at MoMA.  We were given an audio device that you hold up to your ear and it plays information regarding the artwork.  It was nice to hear the history behind the art and really made me appreciate it more.  My favorite  were the polaroids that Andy Warhol took of celebrities and of himself - so perfectly imperfect. Very small gallery though. I love art so this was a nice treat for me and worth the $16 general admission.",1,1
I was very impressed by the Yousuf Karsh exhibit. Included with admission is a self guided audio tour. All you have to do is dial the number next to the picture into your handheld device and you can hear a short narration. The Icons of the 20th Century exhibit is on display until 9/5/16 so be sure to stop by.  There's a small gift shop located adjacent to the ticket booth.,1,1
"I had only ever heard legends of White Castle burgers whether it was through the Harold and Kumar movies or the frozen versions at Albertsons. I was pretty excited to learn that White Castle was fairly new to Vegas so the hype was intense. The line is crazy and the menu is like nothing i've seen before. You basically order for the group or small orders for 1 person. Obviously we went for the 20 burger combo with fries and the chicken rings. Seeing how the burgers are made is mesmerizing. The kitchen is pretty open compared to other fast food restaurants where large machines cover the process. White Castle however lays everything out for you to admire and salivate while you order. They cover the grill with the chopped onions and then place the patties on top. It is definitely a sight to see. 20 minutes later, we got out food which was well worth the wait. Those little sliders are so delicious and fresh. You almost feel bad as you count how many you eat from the 20 burger combo. The onions are probably my favorite part. The fries are really nothing special and i would not order them again. The chicken rings are pretty good but are pretty basic tasting compared to Burger King's. I ate 6 sliders by the way...",1,1
"I have only been here twice at this location. We don't live far but both times we have gone there, food was very good :-) Fast service!",1,1
"If you never tried it, must experience it. Great little burgers that will fill you up. 10 should be enough for a person. Good place for late night in Vegas. Opens 24/7.  Line isnt so long. Worth to try and wait for. Great for hangovers after the club.",1,1
"For a super busy fast food joint on the strip they are getting it done. Waited less than 5 minutes for my food, they clean off the tables as soon as anyone stands up. Ask for the dusseldorf mustard or you won't get it.",1,1
Hi Mike my friend darzell MC joy applied there he is just waiting for you guys to call him,1,1
"I have always wanted to try White Castle; I have only had the frozen burgers.  Needless to say when I saw a White Castle on the strip in Las Vegas I was ecstatic.  The line to order moved fast, the line to pick up food was super slow but who cares its White Castle.  The burgers are small and delicious, the bread was warm and soft.  It was the burger slider.",1,1
"When I was living in Vegas, they didn't have a White Castle yet. This one is fairly new. I wanna say maybe a year now?   Anyways, if you're in Vegas, White Castle is a MUST if you're on the strip. Especially when you're drunk. Their burgers are like sliders, small but they're less than $2!   They are delicious!   They are located near Fat Tuesday and Harrah's hotel.   If you aren't in any of the states that has a White Castle, Target sells frozen boxes of White Castle sliders. It won't be the same but it's close!",1,1
"Have been a fan of White Castle for years! Started when I was a child getting their burgers frozen from the supermarket. At that time I never knew it was a restaurant. Then the popularity from Harold & Kumar happened making want to always try a White Castle restaurant. I finally had my chance this summer in Las Vegas! I was actually feeling like a little kid again as we were on our way walking up the strip looking for this place! A special adventure! I was so happy to finally eat at a White Castle! To me, this was the first mini burger I have ever had, so it was unique.   I ordered the 20 pack of sliders and 2 regular fries combo pack. $25.99 before tax. Sitting down and laying them all out for my girlfriend and I people thought it was all to myself since she was in the restroom. I laughed and said no, I could have eaten all of it, but not today :P The burgers tasted exactly like the frozen ones, just a bit fresher. Not too surprising, would give them a 3 stars. But the extra star for me was the service and overall experience I got from finally eating at this place! Highly recommended for a quick burger bite! Would go back again next time I visit Vegas!",1,1
"This is a good place to come with friends. I was told to try these sliders by Chicago transplants in Las Vegas. I like the burgers, but, I am an In N' Out/ PDQ fan. The sliders are different, however, I have had tastier sliders in Phoenix and Oakland. They serve beer, so it's a nice break to the strip bars or ending the night with friends.",1,1
"OK, let's be honest here...if you like White Castle you like White Castle.  There is no in-between.  I grew up in the midwest, so I happen to love them!  So, I can't help it...  It is a true guilty pleasure.  They are simply little steamed cheeseburgers of joy.  Soft, fluffy and delicious!  I always just get the cheeseburger sliders.   The line here in Vegas can move slow if there are a crowd of people, but the burgers are as good as any White Castle in Chicago.  If you crave...you crave...and this location delivers!",1,1
Ever since I went to White Castle when I visited back east as a teenager I've always wanted to go back because I really enjoyed theirs food. Circumstances be as they may I've never been back east but low and behold they're here in Vegas which is way closer to California. Many people have ranted and raved about shake shack and after trying their much over hyped food my money is and will always be on White Castle. Better service and Better food. It's the way I remember it so many years ago.,1,1
"I had to give them a 4 stars for not putting mustard and catchup on the burgers,  but it was clean, the staff was really friendly, and the wait wasn't terrible.",1,1
"So worth it. Probably not for everyone's taste though. (4 of the 5 of us loved it. One whined cause onions. *rolls eyes* kids.)  My only problem with it is the location. Here I was hoping it would be in like Luxor or maybe even Excalibur (far better placement). As a non-smoker with severe asthma, I was coughing my lungs out to get to it through the casino, and continued to cough while I tried to eat. Next time I'll send someone in to buy, and we'll leave after. -_-",1,1
"Food 10/10 we bought a box of frozen White Castle cheese burger and loved it. The real store is way better   Ambience 6/10 it's on the Main Street of LV, not great but understandable   Service 7/10  We cannot wait to come back again",1,1
The line moved pretty fast. I was in and out with my food within an hour and half. The food was amazing!! Totally worth the wait! Yes the prices were higher as if you were to go back to the mid west. However you have to take into count that. Mid west is cheaper. This is Las Vegas. And also it's the strip everything on the strip is priced higher. So can't complain. Def worth waiting in line for!!,1,1
"after years and years of making microwavable white castle burgers, my drunken self brought my drunken group here after too many Fat Tuesdays!   i ordered 4 of the cheeseburgers and my god these are heavenly!  the right amount of grease from the grill, nice amount of onions, a slab of cheese, a toasty bun to soak up the flavors, the pickles however i was not a fan of and actually was not aware that they were on the burgers but it was not a big downer to the burgers!  one of my friends ordered the chicken rings and these were basically like chicken nuggets but better!   it isn't the cheapest but also not THAT expensive, i think my four burgers came to about $8?    i would love to stop by again for a snack or quick bite next time in Vegas!",1,1
White Castles are my favorite. They started in Wichita but Kansas has no White Castles. Go figure. Las Vegas White Castle opened in January. Order the family pack with 10 or 20. Fries or onion petals atr a must. Cheesecake on a stick is great,1,1
"I was surprised to find that this East Coast chain had found its way to the Las Vegas Strip. So I figured, let's find out what Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about. At first I wasn't that impressed. BUT, for some strange reason, I kept finding myself coming back every night to soak up the day and night of drinking. That smell of grilled onions had such an aroma that I couldn't stay away. I know it isn't the highest quality or best burger, but it got the job done. I found myself ordering the 4 burger meal. They even sell a ""Sack"" or case of burgers (up to 100) AND they serve beer here. Great Combo. I will be back WC. Oh yes, I will be back.",1,1
"I guess I'm like the other hundreds of customers, that ignored the two stars and came to check out White Castle for myself. I have been wanting to try this place for years, so glad when I finally see it in Vegas. Do not come here expecting to have a burger your way with 86 options to choose from, you can venture down the strip if you want to spend 40 bucks on a gourmet burger. This place is serious business here, they have A LOT of employees working in assembly lines preparing burgers, refilling soda machines, stocking up on ketchup, cleaning up as soon as a vacant seat is available, calling out numbers with video screen assistance like the DMV, organized chaos at its finest. The line stayed long, it moved quickly, and the staff was great. I got the cheese sliders, and being a cheese lover I do not think I would enjoy burger as much without it. The fries were mediocre, but probably taste better with toppings. Overall this is a great late night munchies spot and I am sure to return.",1,1
"""It taste so good when it hits the lips!""  This is a Midwestern girls dream come true to the Las Vegas desert. The line wasn't too long. Came here at midnight on a Saturday after a concert. It's consistent taste to any other east coast location I have ever eaten at. Glad they made their way out here. It really seems to be a good location too.   I will probably be back at some point. Good things come in small packages.",1,1
Shaylene gives amazing customer service and I didn't have a single problem even on their busiest days,1,1
"I grew up treasuring White Castle in Detroit in lines before Tiger games... Ooh...the thought of those sliders!!!  But this location is not your typical White Castle-- it is ""on fleek"" lol. Clean and shiny, interestingly located in a casino but reached from the street.   We grabbed a sack with cheese-- fries and drinks. Sliders very good.. Better beverage selection would be a plus.   Customer service... Let's just say we think no one there wants to be there. At least they didn't last night.   Overall, a worthy stop for the White Castle experience. Would rate Detroit #1, Vegas #2 and New York (Brooklyn #3)",1,1
Moved from the Midwest to Southern CA so this White Castles on the strip is the closest to me. Tastes good just like it does back home.,1,1
"This was our family's Christmas Day Lunch/Dinner (depending on what time you eat lunch/dinner). Seeing as my wife and I both love White Castle and there is not one no where near where we stay, this one was GREAT.",1,1
Burgers were good first time eating here heard a lot about it wanted to try it out taste was good on the sliders fries were alright will be bringing my girl and the kids,1,1
My husband has always loved White Castle so of course once he found out there was one a block away from where we were staying (the Venetian) we had to stop in and grab a bite to eat! Thank god this place is 24 hours because the best time to eat it is when you're good and drunk and that is usually late but then again it's Vegas we are talking about! Lol when are you not good and drunk? Anyways!!!!! Awesome drunk food for sure! And it's nice that it's cheap too!,1,1
"I've been buying White Castle slider burgers from the frozen section at Walmart for years and always wanted to try the real thing. I finally had the chance this past weekend while in Vegas and it was awesome. Everything I'd hoped it would be. My wife and I ordered 20 beef sliders, 2 small chicken rings, and 2 fries. It ended up being too much food but was still worth every penny I paid. Will definitely return on my next trip.",1,1
OK I was born and raised in New Jersey where there is white castle all over the place I remember when he first got here to Las Vegas and me and my nanny and son went here for the first time  Yes it's the exact same but it is much larger and caters to a lot of tables and there is a beer offering and it's pretty cool how they fill the cups  The only thing that is a complaint is the fact that it's three times the cost as a normal white castle visit.   This white castle did in fact run out of hamburgers when it opened on The strip I remember the day that it happened and it made headlines It's kind of like a classy white castles if there such a thing,1,1
"Loads of interesting options. They have great combos, all sliders. If you are in a group better get their Castle packs which are great. The place is crowded, so ensure you have time to wait in line. Quick service though. Pretty organized.  Best part: they make their sliders fresher in front of you. They are NOT reheated when you order.",1,1
OMG! My favorite vacation spot meets my favorite burger! The sliders were delicious along with the iconic fries. I recommend everyone go here while on the strip,1,1
"This place is good! short lines and fast service. I ordered about 30 burgers and they came out fast, i ordered them for the drive home and my group ate them all before we can get half way home. Defiantly worth visiting here.",1,1
"We don't have White Castle in California, so this was a must go for my husband. We loved the mini burgers! Preferred the original one patty more than the double. Bought extra to have in our condo for munchies and they reheated well in the microwave. Total yummers!",1,1
"I really enjoy the simplicity of these little sliders.  The onion chips are my favorite side.  The fries are average, but I'm not really a potato person in general.  The frozen cheesecake on a stick is worth the trip alone.     I admit that when I first tried this place it took a while to grow on me, but now I really crave these simple little burgers.  I try to stop in every couple of weeks for a quick bite.  I avoid the weekend tourist crowds and always stop there for weekday lunch.  My parking experience has improved since I discovered the back entrance.  The only bad thing about this place is getting in and out of the parking lot, but that's not the restaurant's fault so I won't ding them for that.  I also get a kick out of the people walking out with two suitcases full of these things.  Like they're buying enough to feed a whole plane.",1,1
"OK, fact not the best burger in the world. Fact not the best slider in the world. However it is a regional thing. People flock to In-N-Out burger as soon as they land in Vegas not because it's the the best burger but because they grew up with in-n-out and the want the nostalgic feeling from their childhood. Just like many of us go to Chic-Fil-A every time we go to California!  Service was friendly, dinning area was clean and the food was hot. If you have never had W/C give it a try you may just like it. If you want a GREAT Burger try the Burger Bar.",1,1
"Well Saturday night is over and what a better way to finish it than stop in for a few white castles, a Coke and some chili cheese fries",1,1
"This was my first trip ever to White Castle. I ordered 2 original sliders, 1 with cheese, and a side of fries. I have to say, I'm a big fan of the fluffy bread and onions. Fries were decent too, and not greasy. I usually just order hamburgers, but I must admit these sliders are much better with some cheese.   White Castle is def a good snack as you walk along the Blvd. looking for trouble. Best to go during weird hours because that line can be Disneyland-long.",1,1
"Ok so for those of us who have never ever had a White Castle from an actual ""White Castles"" I was so freaking stoked about my visit to this holy grail. I truly believe I had the  exact same feeling that Harold and Kumar had when they finally arrive at the place where they have been dying to get to all because they have been yearning for those little magical sliders in the pretty little white box.  As I stepped through the double glass door from the Las Vegas strip and entered this gold mine I was filled with happiness. Who would have ever thought that we would be so lucky to have a White Castle here, but I guess dreams do come true.  The line was not bad and space was pretty small and yes they only have 2 cash register but there was an army of workers in the back cranking out them sliders and the food came out fast. As I am placing my order I am still in disbelief that I didn't have to travel to the east coast to experience this must try burger joint. Any how that was just it. I am giving them a 4 stars because although everything was great the burger itself the one thing that this place is all so famous for was good but I wish was better by being hot and fresh.   I totally understand that in order to meet demands and keep customers happy by getting their food quick they must constantly pump out burgers and let them sit there, and that's where it suffers I think. I burgers itself was a little cold. But never the less I was extremely content. I ordered almost every item on the menu because even though I wish it was a hope skip and a jump, it is not easy for us locals to just drive up and pick us up a bag full of burgers...no you must be strategic about it and actually plan your day to enjoy this place and it's food.   All in all everything was good and I defiantly will be back again and again. I'm crossing my fingers they will open up other locations where we can just pull up to a drive thru and satisfy our cravings a little easier. I think I have been building up the anticipation about White Castles since the movie Harold and Kumar and never thought I would ever get to taste them or get to one without actually leaving Vegas but now I can. So say what you want about this place I am just so happy that after all these years I Finally Made it to WHITE CASTLES!!!! Thank you for opening one up in Vegas.   Oh and the staff was super nice too!!!  ***OOPS I PUT THIS PLACE IS DRESSY BUT I MEANT CASULE*** I hope we all could figure that out! LOL",1,1
"1st time I had white castle sliders... woo-hoo!  very delicious!  cheap, yummy and fast on the strip!  i like their fries - which are not salty, and chicken rings ! open up in canada, will ya!?",1,1
I didn't expect  much being that they only had sliders. But it was surprisingly  good. The grilled onions make it worth it. Definitely  enjoyed our dinner date on the strip!!!!,1,1
"JalapeÃ±o double and onion chips/loaded fries are just so good, not anything like the frozen cheeseburgers quality. Get some Dusseldorf mustard and zesty sauce on the side.",1,1
"It's White Castle. It's its own entity. It's not a hamburger as West Coasters (myself included) think of when you hear the word 'Hamburger'. Once you get into the idea that you're eating something completely different, you're on the road to success.  I fell in love with these little onion-y meat and bun nuggets in Kentucky. I suppose if you hate onions, you'll hate this. The onions are cooked and the patties and buns are stacked on top steaming everything with that onion-y goodness. These were every bit as good as the ones I've had in Kentucky.   Pro Tip: Get a side of onion chips, and order by the sack.",1,1
"I've been craving White Castle ever since Harold and kumar came out. I was elated when I heard they were coming to the west coast and was not disappointed. I'm surprised the location is so small so I can only imagine how quickly it fills up. I got the 2 double slider combo and was blown away. So meaty and cheesy, with the onions and pickle to cut through. No condiments necessary.",1,1
I love White Castle so I was excited one was out my way!! But the parking is horrific because it's located on the strip!!! Sooo wish they would add another location with a drive thru in another area of vegas!,1,1
Service was quick. Sliders are bomb. It's White Castle. Need I say more. Go there. Stuff your face. Drink a beer.,1,1
"Located inside Casino Royal. Hubby and I had the late night munchies after a bit of a shopping. The line was kind of long, about a 15-20 minute wait then an additional 10 min wait.  This was my second time eating White Castle. Their sliders were delicious. We ate a lot of them on the ride home. They are small and perfect, I don't get the same guilt trip I do when I eat other burgers. I tried the chicken sliders for the first time, it's not my cup of tea, I just don't think that chicken should be a burger, I also tried their bacon cheese fries, oh my.",1,1
"In a word, yuuuuuummmmmm!!!! So glad to find a White Castle out west! We walked from the New York New York casino up the vegas strip just to have some of these sliders and they were definitely worth it!!!!! Staff was friendly, kept the area clean which made our experience even better.",1,1
"When I heard about White Castle coming to Vegas, I honestly got excited about it. I've never been to one of their locations before but I figured it would be a cool experience, especially seeing it practically get famous from Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (I can't believe that movie is 11 years old now!)  Located on the Casino Royale side of the Strip, White Castle offers cheap sliders at any time of the day. I honestly think it's better than most fast food chains, but it tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store.  The breakfast slider was pretty good, though. It really isn't anything special because it's just a sausage patty with an egg, but it does the trick if you want something simple and filling for breakfast.  It's not a gourmet burger joint, but it's definitely nice to have one of these on the Strip. The cheap prices and better quality food than other fast food chains are what makes White Castle a winner in my book! It might be a little too over-hyped, but it's still a place to visit just to say you've been to one.",1,1
"This place is unexpectedly good!!!  For a Southern California girl who has only ever eaten these things frozen I went in with pretty low expectations.  But wow!  They were warm and fresh and just good!  The onion fries were also a nice surprise.  I forgot to order the chocolate dipped cheesecake which was a bummer.  Next time!!  If you have never been here, I recommend ordering a few extra burgers. They go down easy, I ate three of them no problem!  Perfect snack after a day of drinking!  Down side is the line is long but that seems to be a Vegas thing anywhere you go!  I will be back.",1,1
It's fast food people. Nothing over the top or special just a perfect snack when you have the munchies and wanna eat 10-15 sliders in one sitting and feel bad about yourself after breaking your diet lmao   For me it's a throwback from when I was a kid eating those little burgers on the tailgate of my mom's station wagon at the drive in movies in Indiana.  I moved to California and was excited to hear they opened a location in vegas because I wanted to taste a memory.    100% the same since I was 5 y.o. everything taste exactly the way I remembered.    10 soft little burgers and we'll done crinkle cut fries :) I felt guilty after eating it just like I would any other fast food binge eating session hahaha   I see bad reviews.  Don't overthink it people.  It's only fast food.  Enjoy responsibly,1,1
"Ok, I'm from Southern California, so I never really got the whole White Castle craze, since it was never in California to begin with.   A recent trip to Las Vegas with my Chicago born girlfriend certainly changed it around for me. First, it's not the in and out type burger most will want. It's a small steamed burger, and it tastes great. Small sliders that are bite sized is what White Castle is all about. Quick service and overall great place in my mind.  Yes, the prices were high, but drive 1200 more miles if you want the closer one, and you'll pay the higher than normal prices for them there. It's Vegas, get over it, most of everything in Vegas is overpriced.   Great times and good food.",1,1
"Had to come check this place out, I'd never had a fresh White Castle burger and I was not disappointed. I got the 4 cheeseburgers with fries and a drink, it tasted fresh and was nice and hot. The onions were a tasty addition and even though I could only finish three of the burgers and half the fries, it was really tasty! Would definitely go back.",1,1
What can I say? It's White (mo fawkin) Castles!! Only complaint is we need some in California. I've been writing them for 30 years BEGGING!,1,1
Perfect east coast addition to the strip.  Sliders were just like I remembered.  Service was quick and easy.,1,1
"Yay!  White Castle west of the Rockies!!!!!  Well located and easy to get in/out.  Inside of the Casino Royale - next to Walgreens. Menu as you have memorized.    Advice:  Go in the daytime, buy a sack and put the leftovers in your room fridge for a late night snack.  Oh so good.  You'll thank me at 3am after a night at Omnia.....  Special shout out to the Saturday morning staff (9am - 7/30/16)  Super friendly and fast service.  Kudos!!",1,1
"Ever since I was a kid listening to the Beastie Boys rap about White Castle, I have always wanted to go there. Living in So Cal, we don't have the opportunity.  Low and behold signs on the way to Vegas advertising for White Castle.   No traffic, no crowds, no parking issue was going to keep us from going.  Park behind and walk to the front of the strip location.   The customer service was great, the location is clean and inviting and the food was so, so delicious.  The burgers were just as good as I had hoped, and the dipping sauce zangy sauce was OUTSTANDING.  I tried to find a copycat recipe of it online, but have failed.    I will definitely, be back when in Vegas again!   Love White Castle.",1,1
"Authentic and typical White Castle...Except it's on the Las Vegas Strip. -Typical White Castle food, either you like it or you don't. -Prices are a bit steep, but it's a high rent location. -This location serves Beer! -Good central location on the Strip. -Friendly employees. -Restaurant was clean. If you want a White castle hamburger and not frozen from a supermarket...this is your only option on the west coast.",1,1
"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!?!?!?  A White Castle on the West Coast of America?!   So to my surprise, I spot this gem and we decide to stop in and make it a White Castle kind of night.  For a whopping $27-we got 10 cheese sliders, 2 cheese fries, and 2 drinks.  Well worth it. So yum! Yeah, it's crap fast food but we couldn't pass it up.  Girl at the front was super nice. It didn't seem like anyone hated their job.   There was a constant line, so obviously business is well. Place was clean-they kept wiping up and such.  Overall, I'll stop in again next time I'm in Vegas and if they are still there.",1,1
I wish we had these in Canada!!  Can't say too much other than the sliders are heavenly  and hit the spot EVERYTIME!   The bun is soft and a bit sweet. Meat is never dry.   Ok I'm drooling... Time for another road trip.,1,1
"This Minnesota boy is now happy.  Las vegas finally gets with the program and White Castle learns a lesson in economics (you go where your rabid fans are). yes it's a square, little hamburger. Yes, it was copied by some Schmuck named Krystal  from the south who claims he had the idea when visiting St Louis World fair..     Some people pay premium dollar to say they have an iPhone, some people pay a price to eat a small, square burger that has its onions and buns steamed with the burger...    This one serves beer... Bonus Points!!",1,1
"White Castle in Vegas ? Whaaaat ?  oh yeh, these were amazing little burgers.  I've had these when I was in Ohio a few years ago and haven't seen a real location out on this coast except in Vegas.  Give them a try.",1,1
"Alright, I've had White Castle once before this. I still don't get what the hype is about.  I waited in line on grand opening night for a little less than two hours, met one new person (while waiting in line with) to be honest I was mostly excited to see the employees because as the they were leaving/entering all were excited.   I payed a little less than $20 tax included for 4 sliders (okay), 2 sodas, 1 chicken ring box thing(mediocre), and a tiny cheesecake on a stick.   The cashier that helped me was great! They didn't seemed overwhelmed at all despite the line going out and around the corner of the street.   What's the 5 stars for?  Because I'd go back for those tiny cheesecake sticks.",1,1
"Yes we went again. My first review was lower only because the Las Vegas prices are higher than what I'm used to in the Detroit area. Food was fine.   This time we looked past the prices and just fixated on the food. The burgers were as good as any WC anywhere but the fries weren't exactly fresh. So while I could knock them for the fries, it's a White Castle and it was a WC experience    The line wasn't long, the wait for the food was alright and the burgers were as good as any. They don't serve win mustard and ketchup but when you have such a massive operation as the LV location you make allowances.   Kudos for a great ""dinner"". Work on those fries and we'll be back monthly because.....it's White Castle baby!",1,1
Greasy-gross-burped up that nasty onion taste the rest of the night. This place is not for me. Buns were good.  I'm changing my review the responder is correct there are other items to try :)  It's still fun to say u went there like Harold and Kumar lol,1,1
Wow! I had always wanted to try these burgers since watching Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle a number of years ago. They did not disappoint. These sliders are so different than any Burger I have had before. The service was friendly and we didn't have to wait long. Can't wait to go back for more.,1,1
"I don't know what happened, but I recall drinking heavily and then waking up the next morning with a big box of white castle burgers.  Now I have never had white castle but I saw these little guys off of the Harold and Kumar movie so I knew I'd like to try them some day.  I didn't know that I would have them off of a drunken stupor, and I'm glad I did, because hung over me was very appreciative of these little guys.  I would like to try to eat here again in passing, without any alcoholic influence, so who knows maybe one day I will!",1,1
Thankful the 'belly bombers' are now on Vegas. I was raised on White Castle ;)  nothing beats those grilled onions! I usually order a dozen with cheese and a dozen without.  Recently tried the fudge dipped brownie!,1,1
It has been about 20 years since going after Cubs games. Now they are in LasVegas on the strip. So walked over during lunch ordered a number 1 4 original sliders fries and a med drink. Yep it was delicious.,1,1
Pretty alright place they have!  Very confusing location. Got two crave cases & some chicken rings (or something idk they had chicken onion ring shaped patties)   I thought I'd have to wait hours in line.   When I walked it I was immediately helped. In & out within 4 minutes!  The staff seemed a little rushed but I give them credit. It got way busy after I left.   The chicken sandwiches I got were so good. I am certainly going back for more very soon!   Thank you White Castle. You guys did a good job!,1,1
"D. Freakin'. Licious. Best drunk food ever. My husband and I stayed at the Venetian and we ate here 3-4 times (we weren't drunk each time lol) during our 2 night 3 day stay. I'm not proud to admit that. Only qualm is that the line one time was ridiculously long and they only had one register. But what made up for it was the customer service. John, the cashier, was super nice. FYI they do offer military discounts.",1,1
"First time eating legit White Castle burgers and it didn't disappoint. Them sliders can be filling (I had 4 of them and i was full)...best part is, they are open 24/7!!! Now that's convenient!! So your missing out if you haven't had White Castle.",1,1
I was super excited to see a White Castle in Las Vegas. Food was hot and made exactly how I ordered. *I wish you had the sack of fries like other locations have. They had enough employees to handle the crowd of customers.,1,1
Great experience!! The burgers were DELICIOUS! The customer service was fantastic and the staff was extremely friendly! I will definitely be back!! So excited that this restaurant finally moved to the west coast!,1,1
"The service was pretty quick. We ordered the 20 pack with 2 fries. The bottom buns were soggy----otherwise, the burgers were pretty good. Would come again if in the area.",1,1
"Grew up in Chicago and always loved sliders! This is more of a white castle ""light"" location meaning, they have a limited menu. However, for me the double cheeseburgers were awesome! They nailed it! Onion chips (think cut up rings) were very good as well. Negatives were the smaller menu (would love some jalapeno burgers), location is not the best, gets a bit crowded/long lines, over priced for sure, and the fries, meh, still not very good. Still, living in Phoenix now, I am thrilled I can get great sliders without having to fly back to Chi-town - I would definitely hit this place every time I was in town.",1,1
"Went today around 3:30 and was only in line for about 30 min. The employees were so nice, and didn't seem stressed at all considering the craziness they've gone through these past few days. They taste just like NY, brings back a lot of memories. The only downfall is the price, they range from $1.10-$1.50 each. NY is like half the price.",1,1
"Just like the ones in Michigan. Steamed onions, patties and buns. Must get the ketchup mustard mix.",1,1
Kids liked their White Castle experience taste just like the frozen ones. Try adding the new jalapeÃ±o cheese really good especially on the fish burgers. Long lines but employees are very friendly and efficient.,1,1
"Thank you White Castle for coming to the WEST COAST.... As soon as they opened in Las Vegas, I was there that week. Can you bring one to CALI please, if not will travel for food.",1,1
"Great first time and I'm digging the sliders so hard.   I've wanted to try White Castle for a while but I'm unsure of where one is in my area. Finally got my chance to and I don't regret it. The prices of the sliders were delightful and affordable. Quality isn't top notch but I feel like it's more enjoyable than a McDonald's burger. And it simply melts in your mouth, it was great, I didn't know that a slider could run like gold down your throat.   I was also really big on the free onion ring slices that came with the sliders. That was amazing! I didn't even ask for that and there they were! I think that's a thing? Am I wrong? Or did the server just love me that much? I'd like to think it's both. Yeah probably both.   While I loved the flavor of what I ate, White Castle is definitely more of a late night snack than a stomach bloating meal. For me at least.  But I loved it none the less.",1,1
Good burgers for a reasonable price... Eat here to save money while on the strip!,1,1
"Okay, so this place is more like 3.75 stars but whatever.  I'm gonna give them a four despite hearing all of Yelp scorning me on my check-in ( :P ).  Hey, we don't have a White Castle in Arizona and I have wanted to try an actual White Castle forever.  Even before I saw Harold & Kumar, I enjoyed their frozen sliders growing up.  Eating the real deal after all this time, even after a great German lunch, was heaven.  It could also be because I was under-dressed for the surprisingly cold Vegas weather but the warmth of a cheese slider was bliss.  I loved every dang bite and I don't care what y'all say.  We ordered a 10-slider, fries, onion rings, and two drinks combo.  We got five regular hamburgers and five cheeseburgers just to see the difference.  I was trying to tell Mike W. that cheese makes everything better but he didn't listen and I ended up having to choke down some plain burgers while he enjoyed my delicious cheeseburgers.  The fries were meh but those onion rings were pretty legit.    All in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in for a quick cheap bite when I'm on The Strip.  Is it the best burger ever?  Haha, of course not.  This is a fast food place, obvi.  But I definitely wouldn't say no to going over to White Castle for a quick bite!",1,1
"Charlton & the gang go to White Castle! Since this Vegas trip was primarily focused on burgers I wanted to experience as many places as possible. Ever since the movie Harold & Kumar go to White Castle popularized the existence of this burger chain to a wider audience, it has always been on the back of my mind to try it. Unfortunately since they are only located in the Midwestern United States, I had to settle on the frozen ones that they sell and love it or hate it, I find them quite tasty!   Las Vegas is known for housing popular ""guilty pleasure"" restaurants that can't be found outside of their respective regions or cities, making them must-visit destinations for tourists. Casinos have opened such iconic locations as Pink's Hot Dogs from Los Angeles in the Planet Hollywood Casino, and New York City's Shake Shack recently found a home inside the New York, New York Casino.  This White Castle is located across the street from the Mirage. You can easily walk to this location by parking either at the Ceaser's Palace self parking or at any other of the casinos close by and walk to it. The location is small but there is plenty of seating available inside. Since I've had the frozen ones plenty of times before, I wanted to order the exact ones which were the cheeseburger sliders. The lowest combo you can get is 4 sliders with fries and a drink which is what I decided to get (having still been fairly full from the buffet from earlier).   Once you place your order, you get a number to wait; thankfully orders are pushed out quick since they are made en masse. The sliders are all packaged individually; I can only imagine how many they go through a day. Taking my first bite, it instantly reminded me of the frozen ones. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The only difference was that there are pickles in the sliders that are not in the frozen ones. It does add more flavor to it but not much else. These sliders go quick, I can usually finish one in two bites or one if I really want to. The fries are crinkle cut, my personal favorite, they aren't as good as Del Taco's or Shake Shack's fries but it gets the job done.   I would suggest coming here if you have NEVER eaten the frozen ones before. Then you can brag to all your friends who live out in the west or east coast saying that you've actually been to an actually White Castle. This place is worth coming for a late night snack, drunk food or a quick meal. Otherwise, if you have had the frozen ones before then you are really not missing out on anything other than the pickle.   I am a fan of White Castle sliders but I'll settle for the frozen ones just fine.   CC out!",1,1
So to start off I'm not a burger fanatic i rarely eat them and if I do its a couple of bites from my son or BF.   What we ordered was the cheese burger slider which came with 4 cheeseburgers a regular fries and a drink. The sliders had pickles cheese and onions. It was soft and good. But if youre a big burger eater i suggest you order their crave packs that have 10 or more depending on how hungry you are. The buns were soft meat was soft too kinda reminds me of a meatloaf in a way but a good meatloaf lol.  We also ordered the onion ring chicken slders it came two sliders regular fries and a drink. The chicken sliders were good it reminded me burger kinds chicken fries. The other stuff we ordered on the side was onion chips theyre like onion rings but turned into bite size pieces of goodness. We also had the bacon ranch fries theyre crinkled cut fries loaded with bacon ranch and cheese. It was pretty good. The other thing I ordered was a vanilla shake it was thick and yummy. Above all I would come bk the lines are long but once you order your food comes out pretty fast. They have an assembly line going on in front of you so you can see what theyre doing to your food. The best part is it's open 24 hours 7 days a week. The location is in between Venetian and Harrahs inside the Casino Royale. Oh yeah they also serve beer for all you beer lovers :-),1,1
First time ever at a White Castle.  Had to see what all the hype was about.  Quick fast food.  Tasty little sliders especially after a night of Vegas drinking.,1,1
The food is addicting.  The little burgers are cute and perfect for the little ones and as for my son awesome for all his food challenges. Every time we are in Vegas we have to stop by white castle. . Decent price . The only down fall is the parking area is not accessible. The other down fall is there is never a place to sit so the kids wait for a place to open to save seats while we order.,1,1
"Wanted to try this place since forever, there wasn't much of a line and the orders came out quick, my daughter is a chicken nugget queen so we got lucky and ordered the chicken rings which were small so you gotta order the 9 piece. We tried both the cheese sliders and original, I think without cheese they have a better flavor. Love it!",1,1
"Had to try it! I was more about the experience than the food I think! paper thin burgers with 5 holes in the middle. Great Mustard Fries were good Very long line, Friday nigh about 40 minutes in line and no lots of seating.",1,1
"Been eating white castle since I lived in chitown, they're a little pricy, but there def worth the wait.....HEY its Vegas so expect to pay more...",1,1
I finally got my white castle burgers and the wait was worth.  Would have given 5 starts but the fries were not good.  So So good.  Wish I would have gotten 6 instead of 4.,1,1
"I've only heard of the wonders that are White Castle sliders. As a CA native, WC is a thing of movies and the frozen aisle at Walmart, but I needed to try the real thing. The line was short on a Sunday at 11am and my double cheese slider was ready in less than 5 minutes. IT WAS ALL I EVER HOPED AND DREAMED OF. The onion content is a bit heavier than I'd have chosen, but I'll know that for next time. Hot, moist, delicious, and satisfying. Why aren't these available closer to home?",1,1
Yay. First time trying and I was not disappointed.   SIMPLE Cheeseburgers & Cheap!  Extra grilled onions  Liked the open kitchen layout. Super Clean! Friendly staff.,1,1
"Are you in Las Vegas in the north part of the strip, drunk, hungry, wandering around, already took off your heels and have flat/slippers/or just nastily barefoot? White Castle is there for you! I mean, it is what it is! If you think chicken nuggets are unnaturally shaped, get on some chicken RINGS! I cannot differentiate between regular White Castle burgers from the brick & mortar and the frozen ones. It's like they might as well have a bunch of microwaves to warm up the frozen mutant meat--no one is going to notice or care.  Chicken Rings, wtf? Yes.",1,1
"I love how all of these east coast classics are making their way to Las Vegas! I guess that is the one perk about living in a city that is just one big tourist destination.  White Castle made its debut a few months ago in Casino Royale, a hotel that is smashed between the Venetian and Harrah's. White Castle is really easy to find since their have their own entrance from the street. I have read the reviews about the long lines, so I waited out the hype and my first visit was last week. I was there around 4pm on a Sunday and the line was not too bad-- I would say tops, 15 minutes.   We ordered four cheese sliders, a double slider, loaded fries, regular fries, cheese sticks, and drinks. The person took our order asked where we were visiting from and when replied that we lived here she offered us a 10% local discount. Sweet! You wait for your number to be called at the end of the counter. The food came out in about 5 minutes.   Cheese Sliders-- They are pretty tiny, seeing how the meat in the burger is about the thickness of about 10 post it notes stacked on top of each other. But hey, they were still pretty tasty. I like the squishy buns. Ha, that sounds really weird.  Fries-- Crinkle fries are better than any other fries in the whole entire world. So, I like!  Loaded Fries-- Meh, could skip on these. The bacon and cheese toppings were not that special.  Cheese Sticks-- I think these things could be good if there was better marinara sauce. The sauce comes in one of those sauce tubs that do not require refrigeration. It has a weird after taste.   After reading all of the mixed reviews, I have to say that my visit was better than expected. A lot of people are saying that it is not like how it is on the east coast, but that's how it usually goes. The original is always better. Don't even get me started on Shake Shack LV. All of our mini sliders & fries came out to be around $20-- but that was expected, since this is the strip. The next time I want to try the cheesecake on a stick or the chicken sliders. I think I saw a sign that said that they also have a breakfast menu.  Oh yeah, White Castle is open 24/7 to satisfy your after party munchies.",1,1
"So who was the wise guy that thought a whopping two registers was going to cut it? There's an army deep of prep workers and cooks in the back and periodically over a block long line of White Castle fans, with a team of security directing traffic and you only have TWO registers? Yeah, its awkward.  O T H E R W I S E...  Woohoo! White Castle is officially in Las Vegas! I can't speak on behalf of anyone else, but White Castle holds a special place in my tummy. I was born in Minnesota and still have family living there, so whenever I would visit, my uncle would welcome me to town with a crave case. What says love more than a giant box, shiny with grease, filled with sliders?  Of course, this is nowhere near the top ranked best fast food burger, but it wins in the nostalgia points! Mini sliders with grilled onions - you can't go wrong there -  portable, cute, easy to eat, and especially reminds me of my childhood. Their burgers taste like how I remember it, so they don't do a bad job at this Vegas location but consistency is questionable. On our second visit my sliders were all too soggy for my liking - which is not good, not good at all.  I actually prefer the original sliders over the cheese slider since the cheese overwhelms the flavor of the grilled onions too much and I love love LOVE the flavor of the grilled onions. Sometimes I would try to ask them for extra grilled onions and most of the time I am unsuccessful, but it's worth a try.   We also dabbled in their cheese fries with ranch and bacon and the crew thought it was pretty tasty, but I think their crinkle cut fries need major work and typically taste stale. I really like their ranch sauce so I dip my sliders in it from time to time. Also pass on their onion chips, the batter is dense and not that great. Their shakes are simple, vanilla or chocolate - nothing crazy, but its not bad either. I don't think they offer a strawberry shake at this location since I would of been all over that. Oh yeah and they have brownies and cheesecake on a stick - just thought I'd let you know.   I can typically eat 5 sliders on a good day and it is filling! For a normal person I think that 3-4 sliders is just right. For the overzealous types they also offer crave cases  and crates that range anywhere from 30-50-100! Dang. Don't come in here expecting an amazing burger - just great memories - KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN CHECK and I think you will be in a good place.  RIP stomach.",1,1
Stopped off for these little tasty treats on the way to checking into our hotel. They were melt in your mouth delicious! Better eaten fresh and not cold. It's a definite must stop in whenever in vegas,1,1
Tastes just like the Midwest classic! Lots of seating and it's open all night! Definitely will hit the spot!,1,1
I Love White Castle burgers I waited 45 min because they just open in Vegas and I had 6 of them and they brought back memories back from my New York days.,1,1
"Hell yes! That's all I said when I Jumped in line, growing up with a New Yorker in the house you learn a thing or two about the east, one thing I leave was WC! Growing up he always said the freezer boxes weren't the same.. I didn't understand till my first time in his hometown, the greatest experience ever!  Came to Vegas for my Bday and relieved a Childhood memory of a deprived west coast child, bitter sweet coming without pops but I know he's looking down smiling because I ordered the same way he used to! The service was Great! The line was Short the fries fell short on taste but that's expected they aren't known for the fries not bad but not amazing.. The employees were great! Very involved! Over all a great experience this will be a go to spot for me every time I come to Vegas!",1,1
"Was just as I remembered growing join the Midwest, but the bread was soggy and the prices were a lot hugger. In Michigan, the current price is $4.99 for the number one. Here it's $7.99. I know it's located on the strip, but I was sooooo looking forward to coming here for an affordable meal.   Also, the employees could at least smile! A smile goes a very long way! Making someone feel welcomed will keep them going back. With that and the prices I won't be in a rush to come back before I leave Vegas.",1,1
"At least, I can chalk this one off the list! What were Harold and Kumar thinking?!? I was just expecting GREATNESS! The sliders were made with a thin soft bun with a small hamburger patty. I'm kind of a lettuce, tomato, and pickle on my burger gal so I found them to be plain for my taste, but not bad. The fries were good. I'd only go back if a friend wanted to go.",1,1
"Good luck finding a White Castle stand-alone restaurant anywhere in California or the West Coast. This White Castle is the closest one I know where I live, but I wouldn't make the drive solely for WC. If I'm going to Vegas, I'm gambling, going to different buffets, and having my fun while I'm out here! I've came here on two separate visits to enjoy WC burgers. Cooked fresh in front of me instead of buying the WC burgers in my local supermarket freezer or convenience store.  I'd imagine this WC gets a ton of foot traffic and their employees getting paid well doing what they do. Do they deserve $15/hr? Hell no! Because of what I said, there will often be long lines which doesn't bother me much. The food is well worth the wait, and if you love their food wouldn't you mind waiting a little longer? They also don't serve burgers, nope. Veggie sliders, fish sliders, etc are also on their menu. I don't come here for anything but their burgers. I mean aren't they known for their burgers? I don't mind variety and options, but In N Out has done so well just serving burgers!",1,1
"I lived in Indiana for 9 years. I learned to appreciate White Castle from the locals. I'm going with 5 Stars due to years of memories from that extended experience. This was before things like WC fish burgers and the newest veggie option. I don't understand all the 3 Star reviews and won't even try to. All I can do is state my own opinion.   Venue: Very small shop, by Las Vegas standards,  that is right off the strip and is right next to/inside of  a casino. Most easily reached by walking a distance once you find a place to park. There is no convenient parking to speak of. So I recommend combining a trip to WC with something else. Small eating area that was full because the shop was so busy.  Food: The traditional White Castle menu is very simple. Onion Chips, Regular White Castle Burgers, and White Castle Cheese Burgers. But, I don't eat meat burgers anymore. So I was very interested in trying the fish burgers and veggie burgers. These are non-traditional items. I'm sure some are shocked and appalled with the concept. I was motivated to give these a try as I may not get to the midwest in the near future.  Veggie Burger: Good but a great effort at providing meatless. i appreciate the effort. They provide a choice of sauces with these as they are needed. The fish burgers were a similar strong effort. Well appreciated by those on dietary restrictions.   Yes,  I was a bit underwhelmed by the veggie burgers but the chance to indulge myself in old memories was priceless. I'm glad I made the effort to seek out this White Castle experience.  Service: 5 Star Service from a very busy crew.",1,1
"White Castle was on my list 'to try' when I was in Vegas. Though I was never a fan of the frozen White Castle sandwich I still wanted to try this one.  The line was super long when we got there, and waited at least 30mins in line. We ordered two of the Cheese Sliders Combo, which came with 3 cheese sliders, fries and a drink. I wasnt really expecting too much thinking it will taste exactly like the frozen ones, but I thought they were pretty good! I wouldnt say that im obsess with it tho, lol. I would still recommend it if you're in Vegas just to say that you've tried it. Lol.",1,1
Late night snacks? Definitely. I think ti was $4 for a double slider and loaded fries. Can't go wrong with either!,1,1
"Finally people on the west coast get a White Castle Restaurant! For the tourists, it would be easiest to park at The Venetian and then walk south on the strip.  I really liked the Cheeseburger sliders. The way its cooked makes it a little soft, but i really liked it. It's different from all the other fast food places here. The fries are nothing special (just not my thing) but they did have the bonus of reminding me of my childhood. My suggestion would be to get the loaded fries.  Can't wait to go back and try more! I loved that they had Mell Yello!",1,1
My first time ever!! And it did not disappoint! We grabbed one of the large packs which included 20 sliders. They are small since they are sliders but they are yummy! Flavorful cheesy meaty goodness that melts in your mouth!,1,1
"It was worth the experience to see what all the hype was about. 5 stars for service and burgers....1 star for the prices, although being on the strip I expected to pay more, It was a little much. The frozen ones from the grocery store are just as good:)",1,1
"cool for us west coast people.  came here late night 2 am and maybe 4am.  place was pretty clean.  food came out fast.  no complaints here.  minor issue of someone passed out and some goofballs trying to take pictures of the dude koed.    yeah-burgers         -onion rings ok-fries  no-chicken rings  fast, quick, easy done!  the food is w.e but hey now ive been to white castle.  me and harold we did it",1,1
"My friends and strangers alike were telling me, urging me, don't get my hopes up for White Castle. It's not worth it.   But for me, it was worth it every one bit. I ordered one of every type of burger. The double burger with jalapeno cheese was my favorite--so melty, so soft, so delicious and perfect. I literally could have finished it in a bite. Burgers were not greasy one bit.   We tried the onion chips as a side since they seemed to be the most unique. I could have done without them, but they were a nice accompaniment.   I love watching the employees make the little burgers. So efficient and coordinated. It's gross looking at the raw little patties (I mean, who knows what's in that meat despite them emphasizing it's 100% beef) but still, it was delicious.   I can imagine myself finishing an order of 30 burgers if I could...  White Castle isn't In-n-out, my forever favorite, but every time I'm in Vegas, I'll be making a stop here.",1,1
Very good as I remember them growing up in Bronx N.Y . Have not had one in years. They need to put one in every state. These burgers are good when you have a lot of kids with you.,1,1
"First time trying White Castle out and it was what I expected. These little cheap burgers definitely hit the spot. I wasn't expecting the soggy/steamy taste but it was surprisingly good. The area seems a bit sketch and the casino nearby looks a bit run down, but the food was good so I can't complain. I also don't see much crinkle fries around and this place had them! I ended going back the next day to get more of those delicious square burgers. Will definitely come back whenever I'm in Vegas again.",1,1
I went here for my first time and the food was great. Shaylene was very friendly and patient when my party didn't know what we wanted. She even recommended some items to us.,1,1
"This place is horrible, we were so excited to try it since I got a gift card for my birthday. We went in an ordered are whole meal and they did not except are gift card, because their system was down. Unacceptable, this would have been so helpful if we would have known this prior!!",-1,-1
Decent customer service but the food was awful. It was cold and had no sauce at all. I was expecting it to be good but this place really went down hill. I will never eat here again.,-1,-1
"The staff here is great and they're nice,  wonderful and quick. People were ranting in raving about pei wei, I had to try it.  Even good yelp reviews.  I'm highly dissatisfied with the flavor of the food. This  should be labeled Asian inspired and not Asian. I've tried a variety of Chinese restaurants, this doesn't taste close to anything I've had at other Asian restaurants. Their Mongolian beef  was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us. Neither me or my husband enjoyed either of  our dishes.  We didn't even eat half of our plates.  We even refused to take it home with us.  If you like and enjoy what typical Asian food tastes like,  don't waste your time here.",-1,-1
I had the garlic ginger broccoli chicken and it was not very good. The broccoli was hardly cooked and the sauce was way to sweet. Everything else was great. I will give them a few more tries before I write them off as another crappy Asian restaurant in Surprise.,-1,-1
"Definitely not a fan. Coming from Orange County, CA, I have high expectations when it comes to Asian food.  Suffice to say that Panda Express would have been a better choice, which is pretty sad.",-1,-1
I wish I could give 1.5 stars. Nothing special. Lack of flavor. The entrees were either sweet or spicy. The crab Rangoon were.....different. The filling had a mealy consistency. Friend rice was bland. Plenty of other places to spend 50$ on takeout. Save your money.,-1,-1
Disappointed that on yelp their hours show them open at 1030am but when you arrive they don't open until 11am. Waiting in the car to pick up a large order makes me think twice about catering from here. Don't get me wrong the food is great as always but they need to fix this.,-1,-1
Typical big business chinese place. Slightly fancy but very average food. Kinda like a fast food place.... you walk up and order then get your own drinks etc. Portions are very small. Prices are higher than average.  They offer a few different vegetarian options but it all tastes pretty bad  do yourself a favor and also support a local business and eat at big buddha around the corner. Its much better food,-1,-1
"If I could give no stars I would. My family placed an order to be picked up and were told to be there at 7:20. We get there and I sit waiting for the food until 8! Nobody acted like it was a big deal when I told them and just said ""oh.... Well we are running behind."" Um okay?! We get home and they forgot to put the crab puffs in my bag. Didn't bother going back and moved on to our meals. My honey glazed chicken was average, edible. My husbands sweet and sour chicken was so soggy it was disgusting! Couldn't even eat it. My daughter loves fried rice and wouldn't even eat hers, it was so greasy. We all ended up eating PB&J's and it was 100x better than anything we brought home.",-1,-1
"I really don't understand how anyone can eat the food from here.  Granted, I am Chinese and enjoy authentic food, however I like good Chinese American food.  For someone who usually doesn't leave food on her plate unless it is really bad, I could not finish my meal because it was tasteless and below average.",-1,-1
"Went in for lunch with a coworker today. The small portions are overpriced and really aren't small-half would've been more than enough.  We were served quickly and the staff was friendly! The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed quickly.  I was disappointed with my Mongolian chicken. It tasted more like Teriyaki and was swimming in sauce. I had at least a 1/3 cup of sauce left on my plate after eating my food. All in all, PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.",-1,-1
"OH MY GOD, this place. I used to like Pei Wei until I moved to Surprise and this location ruined it for me. They consistently screw up on orders, have huge wait times, and run out of key ingredients on an alarmingly regular basis. We just spent an hour waiting for a take out order (kung pao veggies and vegetable fried rice), which was twice the time they quoted us, only to be told they were out of WHITE RICE (how does a chinese restaurant fail to foresee the possibility that they might serve a lot of white rice on a Saturday night?!). I may have chosen to stick around the extra 15 minutes if they hadn't already had to re-make half my order after making it incorrectly the first time. When I change up an order even slightly to accommodate for allergies/dietary needs, they have to re-make it at least 75% of the time. If the food was consistently delicious, I'd rate it higher, but honestly, it's only okay.",-1,-1
"Haven't eaten at this location in particular, but in general the prices are high for what you get.  It's nothing special and any other Chinese place in the city can probably beat it in the price/quality area.",-1,-1
We went as a family of 6 and was treated very poorly by the manager at the  place. The food was greasy (I guess most Americans would love it since they don't see the difference) The manager had the audacity to compare this restaurant with PF Chang which is equally greasy and bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to any health conscious people. To top it all its expensive. Go to taco bell or China Panda and save your frustration and your appetite. Just being fancy is not the attraction motto for me. Maybe they will train their managers to change the attire of the restaurant. I wont waste my time here.,-1,-1
"We are winter residents and always look forward to eating here when we return.  Sorry to say we were quite disappointed with our Pad Thai orders today, so much sauce that it resembled a thick soup.  The egg ingredient seemed to be overlooked and was in big slices rather than smaller curds,  when I asked a server about the sauce he replied that it wasn't really sauce but that the rice noodles were too wet.  Either way, it was not a pleasant dish today.",-1,-1
"Took the family there last week.  Ordered fried wontons, sweet and sour beef, Mongolian beef, honey crusted chicken and pad Thai noodles.    The Mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.  Honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.  Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.  They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he ""let us keep the spring rolls"" and ""didn't charge is for all of our drinks"" as if he did us a favor.  Overall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!  I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day..",-1,-1
"In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking.   We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers.   With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?",-1,-1
"Just dirty ... Sometimes I wonder why we come back here. At the register the girl handed me a cup. There was particles of food on the inside. I handed it back and said ""It's dirty, I'll take a different one."" She put the dirty cup back with the other 'clean' cups. I stopped and restated ""No. It's DIRTY, you probably shouldn't give it to someone else."" (Shaking my head)",-1,-1
"The problem may be that I lived in the Bay Area for 30 years. There, bad restaurants expire in less that a year.  Pei Wei wouldn't last very long.  We had the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken.  The beef was in a salty, sticky sweet brown sauce that rendered it almost inedible.  The Chicken had little spice or sauce, although the pea pods were fresh.  Think Panda Express. Food is not serve family style. Food is ordered at the register and brought (eventually) to your table.",-1,-1
"The wait time for the food was way too long- 30 minutes for a bowl of spicy noodles with some veggies. I'm a guest from out of state but this is nothing better than my local Panda joint. They should probably let the customers cook the food cause we could do it faster.  The food was okay but the portions were a bit big. While I was waiting for the food (+30 min) I noticed a lot of people just ate a few bites and left the food on the table. So much food wasted- there must be a reason for that right??  The bathrooms weren't clean, barely had soap no towels and toilet didn't even flush!!  I hope next time I'm down here that it isn't this bad.",-1,-1
"Love the food but it's great at all locations. The customer service is horrible at this location. Only two tables were occupied at the time we walked in for a carry out. We walked in and they looked at us like.....really? Go away!! Someone walked up to the register and he just looked at me. I asked him if he was ready to take my order and he just kept looking at me like I was wasting his time.  No thank you, nothing. Just a hand to take my money and then a bag in my face so I would leave and get out of their faces. Really???",-1,-1
"I usually go to pei wei regularly and am usually over all satisfied.  However today did not go well . First I was unable to order online,   when I  went to pick up the food I brought  a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal. When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket.  The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for?  BUYER BEWARE...",-1,-1
"Always the same old bad Mexican food. At least this time I did not get the nearly 2 foot piece of hair in my Fajita Burrito. Why many people I know, including my wife like to go to this place is beyond me.",-1,-1
Amazingly good Mexican food but they rip you off EVERY time.  They scratch your order on a piece of paper with no descriptions and prices never add up. Its ALWAYS more. We have checked this several tines and wrote down everything we ordered and the prices on the menu and its been 20-30% higher consistently every time.  Its too bad they scam their customers like this because the food really is awesome.  Write down everything you order and be prepared to question your bill.,-1,-1
"The food isn't bad, but every time I come here with friends they overcharge us. We end up getting charged at least a few dollars more than our menu items should be when we check out, and it's happened on several different occasions.   Though the food may have been good and reasonably priced (on the menu, not on the bill), we will unfortunately never be going back. Very disappointing.",-1,-1
"i don't understand all of the high marks for the this place. the chips were not good and the salsa wasn't good either.. the chips were bland, old and not seasoned at all, the salsa represented canned tomato taste, yuk, the chix enchilada was flavorless, while using white meat chicken it was not seasoned and very chewy, it had no flavor whatsoever and was definitely something ""not"" to order. the  most off putting thing about the place is the filthiness of all the furniture and the fact that we had fruit flies buzzing our table thru out our meal. while el rodeo and el patron are nearby, and have far better food,i cant understand what the attraction is to this place, will not be back",-1,-1
"Passed this place a few times and finally decided to try it. I got the #17 on the lunch menu. It was a burrito  with eggs, chorizo and cheese.  It was probably one of the most tasteless burritos I've ever had. It was covered in what appeared to be some sort of franks red hot sauce, and no im not mistaking it for enchilada sauce. The side of my plate was a pile of tomatoes shredded cheese and a piece of lettuce, a whole piece not shredded. Not happy with my lunch at all. The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me. I like quick service, but also don't mind waiting a few minutes for some really good food. Overall the place was cute, people were friendly but food was less than OK. I wouldn't go back.",-1,-1
Very bland. Salsa is like tomato sauce. Enchilada sauce taste like canned marinara.. just awful.,-1,-1
"I was very excited to try Table 17, and unfortunately it was a huge let down. I was made to feel very uncomfortable from the moment that I walked in. It was terrible service, and I was very surprised to see this. The waitress asked us to order our appetizer and entree at the same time, causing us to feel very rushed. We waited about an hour for our dinner and were quite disinterested when the food even came.  The beef tartar was by far my best course. The scallops were fine, as to be expected. The broccoli Was good once you were able to get past that it was cold. Wine list by the glass was limited, and we never heard of any specials for the evening. We did receive bread with oil prior to the meal, but no extra plate to put the oil on. We had to get up ourselves and go to the bread table for a plate, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. An all around let down for a place that I had heard was good.",-1,-1
"I wish I could share Avitania B.'s Groupon enthusiasm because I found this place a big let down. I too had a $50 Groupon here and was really excited to give it a try.   At first I was concerned that this place may be too fancy and romantic for a casual dinner with a friend, but the other patrons made that problem go away fast! Picture It's 9pm and you are trying to enjoy your meal next to four tables of three super loud middle-aged women who are all gossipping and complaining about their ""first-world problems"": She only got a 1.5 karat ring... I hate it when my maid doesn't iron the cuff on my pants... blah blah blah. I honestly wanted to tell them to all shut up. This is by no means the restaurant's fault but killed the ambiance for sure.  The food itself was good but the portions are quite small. I also found the menu selection to be minimal with only 6 entrees to choose from including a super tasty but super small bowl of pasta with wild mushrooms for $18.  I found the service friendly but very slow and inattentive. At times I felt as though I might need a bell to get the waiter's attention.",-1,-1
Disappointing experience.  The restaurant was packed and my friend and I were crammed into a small table where we were basically touching elbows with the tables beside us.  The food wasn't anything special which surprised me - I had been intrigued to try this place for a while but I won't be going back.,-1,-1
"Meh. Service was bad and food wasn't much better. The restaurant was clearly understaffed and our server rushed us all night.  To be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. The main course was a huge disappointment. My fiancÃ© ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. It was bland and undercooked. The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. Super bland, no spices.   Maybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed.",-1,-1
"I wanted to go to Table 17 since I moved down to Leslieville and was excited to finally find an opportunity to go. My party of 2 got there around 9 pm and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Unfortunately that's how the night continued. The decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn't receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated. We ordered drinks and decided none of the entrees looked appealing enough to pay about $28 bucks plus for, so we shared appetizers. We waited about 15 minutes for our drink. When we finally received our food at about 9:45 it was nothing special. To top it all off even i got the bill and they charged me for an entree I didn't even order. There are too many options in the area to go back for a mediore experince.",-1,-1
"They are changing their complex name to Mosaic, so be forewarned the issues will exist there, too.  I am sick of this. The water to my apartment has just been shut off 3 times in 3 months. The first time, the guy doing their renovations cut a line, the they had a scheduled outage that resulted in dirt in my lines, and now I wake up and there is no water and I can't get a hold of anyone at the leasing office or maintenance to ask if it will be on in time for me to shower before work!  Also, there is a line that drips from behind my washing machine to an open pipe and no one has ever come by to fix it after complaining to the front office. They also can't keep the walkway light by my apartment stairs lit, and I come home from work after it is dark. Since I come home after dark, I notice that it seems like the gates get stuck open pretty frequently.  The new management company also doesn't believe in posting how much you owe before it is past due. You can either set up an auto withdrawal or risk they won't have it up before you are late.",-1,-1
"I was going to post this for the leasing office, but it seems more appropriate to put it under the community as a whole...  After searching for a new place for a couple of months, I settled on Acacia Creek.  I had liked what I'd seen on the walk-throughs, and everyone in the office was pleasant enough.  One thing I'd noticed, however, is that the prices for their available units change every day.  So I waited until the price was where I wanted it to be, and headed over with the full intent to sign a one-year lease.  Right before I entered the leasing office, I pulled up their website on my phone and confirmed the amount.  I walked in and was seated with an agent/manager with whom I had toured the property less than a week ago.  We made small talk, and she pulled up the unit in question...and quoted me a price ten dollars higher than what I saw online.  It wasn't that big of a deal, but I was quite confused.  I pulled up the price on my phone again and noted that at that very instant, there was a discrepancy between what she said and what I saw online.  Her defense was that ""[their] prices change every day,"" but when I asked about the accuracy of the online pricing, she just repeated the line.  I tried to find out why she would give me a different price quote, and she just repeated the line again.  I had my phone, and the unit price, staring me in the face, and she was telling me that it was wrong!  She then said that I should have booked during the previous week and said goodbye, as she apparently wasn't willing to negotiate down to their listed price or explain what was going on.  I have no idea why she couldn't say something like, ""Our website isn't accurate - you should call,"" or, ""Let me see what I can do"" or anything like that. She was willing to lose someone who was ready to sign ON THE SPOT because she couldn't be bothered to explain a slight difference in rent rates.  If this is how they treat prospective tenants who WANT to live there and pay their rent, I can't imagine how they treat their residents.",-1,-1
"It wouldnt matter if I had all the riches in the world its just not my style all the uppity, high-end clothing & jewelry, to me its just not impressive. Yeah it sure is expensive but Not my cup of tea.",-1,-1
"Some great shops, but CRAZY hard to get your bearings, find the store you're looking for, or keep track of which ""aisles"" you've ""done"" and what's left to shop... for a sport shopper like me, that's incredibly annoying - and tends to keep me away. Given almost all of these stores can be found in at least one other shopping center in Vegas...",-1,-1
"Be prepared to drop some serious cash here at the Shoppes. (I'm wondering myself why they added an 'e' in shoppes - maybe for that added flavor of pretention, haha). They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd.   My friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, ""That one is $1400."" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says ""Okay,"" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun!  Nothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself?   For the hard-working middle class schmo and ""normal"" crowds, I recommend the Miracle Mile shops or Fashion Show Mall. I'm sure once the blazing summer heat kicks in, people will use this mall as an air-conditioned excuse to stay off the strip.",-1,-1
"I came in for the first time, sat down to setup my computer, and within 2 minutes had a server telling me that if I do not order anything I will have to leave. I'm not sure if I was being judged by the way I looked (wearing sweatpants and ratty t-shirt), or if this is standard practice. I was planning on staying and purchasing a drink, but found this treatment extremely rude and uncomfortable. Do not plan on returning.",-1,-1
"Great selection of teas. sushi are fresh, but I don't like the sushi rice they used, much sticky than I thought for sushi rice",-1,-1
"I wouldn't have guessed that a tea cafe would sell sushi but my friend recommended to try this place. Ordered the Twin City Roll which had tuna, salmon, avocado, and cucumbers. There was more sushi than rice so the ratio was good. The sushi looked good and I thought the price was reasonable. But when I was eating it, the sushi didn't seem fresh. There was a strong fish smell and the aftertaste left a slimy feeling on my tongue. The interior of the cafe also had a weird smell... I don't know how to describe it exactly. I don't think sushi and tea smells go well together? I don't know if I would recommend coming here for sushi. Maybe their tea is better as it is a tea cafe.",-1,-1
"So I know Christy's is a Madison tradition with those lovely views of Lake Waubesa. But this place is a one-track pony... location, location, location. This is a family-owned bar/restaurant and the owners know they have a captive audience. The beer is cold and the food is average, but the service is atrocious. On a recent beautiful Saturday afternoon, there were only two servers for the outside seating area.  There's no host, so we (4 adults and 1 kid) sat at a picnic table and proceeded to wait at least 10 minutes to no avail. We eventually went inside to order drinks and lunch. At no time during our visit did a server ever approach our table. I'd certainly be inclined to write off this awful experience to a bad day or poor staffing, but unfortunately this is more the rule rather than exception. One really weird thing is the Friday Fish Fry that features a special menu available ONLY inside, this isn't communicated very well;  so you'll grab a table outside, wait to order only to learn you can only order from the pizza/sandwich menu.",-1,-1
"Unless you're a local yokel McFarland douchebag, you won't get any measure of service here.  After waiting more than 15 minutes for a server outside, I went inside to inquire of outdoor food service.  Of course, since I am not one of the regular inebriated bar flies, getting the attention of a bartender is nearly impossible.  I guess I'm just not loud enough, drunk enough, or both.  And once I did get his ear, the next local loudmouth douche bag stumbles up to the bar and interupts me to order his next round of Captain and Cokes (classy).  So we left and will never be back...unless of course we lose all sense of decency and purpose and relocate to McFarland.",-1,-1
"Enjoyed a beautiful day on the patio last Sunday listening to the Blue Olives (they're great!) and sipping beer. Ordered the nacho's and was fully disappointed-a somewhat small pile of flavorless corn tortillas and minimal cheese, chicken, peppers, and a clump of black olives. It appeared to have been placed briefly under a hot broiler as the top was charred and any buried shredded cheese was unmelted. The result was a very dry dish that required multiple cups of salsa to provide flavor and moisture.  Note: This review was written during the summer of 2014 but I just found it in my Drafts-- sorry for the delay!",-1,-1
"Love going here during the summer.  Nice bar outside and great people and boat watching.  Went here for dinner last week and it was just Meh.  Food was bland an uninspired.  What the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered.  After we asked, she still didn't know what was included with the dinner.  Walleye sandwich was just OK.  Service was on the slow side too; one server for the entire 2 floors.  The lady tried hard, so she earned a good tip.  The kitchen and management could do a lot better.  Probably will not go here again for dinner.  Too bad because we do like the place overall.",-1,-1
"I have been to Christy's quite a few times over the years and have never had a very good meal; however, last night's meal was a disaster! It started with the bartender getting our drink order wrong, One member of our party received a different potato than ordered, 1 had a different salad dressing than ordered and I had the worst fish fry EVER. It could have been good if the breading wasn't soggy on one piece and excessively crispy with holes in it (looked exactly like a funnel cake!). The baked potato tasted dry and leftover. The one high point was a waitress (first night on the job) that was very friendly and actually cared about our poor experience. Christy's is back on my list of places to avoid.",-1,-1
"Worst service ever. we arrived at 7 pm on a Friday night. Since it's on the lake, were not surprised there was a wait, but didn't really seem to be enoughpeople waiting for 1-1/2 hour wait.  We sat on the deck with a couple of drinks, and enjoyed that. At the 1-1/2 hour mark, went in to see how much longer and were shocked to see the mostly empty dining area in the bar. Maybe the upstairs dining was busy? Nope- one table of 4 waiting to be served, and 2 large tables of people who had finished eating and were doing their party speeches. We think they just forgot us. Brief wait for the waitress.10 minutes later got our salads for 2 of us, soup for 2  (husband wanted cole slaw, but they were out). Soup was good. Salad was very small, with a huge carrot 'coin' and cucumber slice. italian dressing was blah, bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks. 30 minutes later, caught the attention of our oblivious waitress to check on the status of our order, and her comment was ""didn't they tell you it would be an hour wait?"" Wouldn't that be the waitress' job? After another 20minutes, and the 1 hour mark, i went to find a manager. Bartender blew me off, so I went to find the host,who apologized, said it was coming out now, and said they ""were just catching up"". From what? The bar area dining was almost empty, and we were still one of two 4 person tables up in the big dining area. 5 minutes later, with no waitress, no food, we left. We will not be back. Maybe the food is good, can't comment on that, but the aggravation is not worth it.",-1,-1
"I've been here a few times. The cheese curds and fries are nice. Onion rings ok.  Wings my kids love but I think they are too smothered in sauce. Each time I've been here It was by boat so we've sat out side. I would have rated it a 3 or 4 except each and every table has an ash tray which is gross and they allow smoking in the entire area. My kids 6 and 11  were with us and one has asthma so we had to move to get out of the smoke. Very inconsiderate allowing smoking, only 3 out of maybe 40 people were smoking so maybe inconvenience 3 people and not everyone else. Going forward Ill probably just get takeout.",-1,-1
"We tried the fish fry a few weeks ago after hearing great reviews from friends. We weren't disappointed. Everything was wonderful. Tonight we went back and our experience was the opposite. The lobster bisque was cold ( Apparently, they forgot to turn the burner on and we were the first to mention it. We were there at 8:00pm.). The fish was okay and the waffle fries were cold. My husband asked why we didn't get any bread. He was told that they ran out. We found that interesting since people who were seated after we were had bread. Not sure we need to go back.",-1,-1
Just got back from this restaurant for the third time. It is close to where we live and like the convenience of going there. This was the last time though. When we arrived we where told we needed to wait 5 to 10 mins for a seat. After 15 mins we where seated in a room with 10 open tables (not sure why we needed to wait).  About another 15 mins went by and 2 other tables where seated and served drinks and still no one waited on us.  No one ever did so we left.   The other times that we have been the food is only mediocre for bar food at best.,-1,-1
"This place is good only for the outdoor atmosphere. Their online menu does not correspond to their actual menu, buy they don't seem to see this as a problem. I requested my favorite beer: ""Oh, we're out of that."" Then, my second favorite: ""We're out of that too."" As a vegetarian, I had to order a black bean burger, which was burned, as was the bun. I asked for a dark or spicy mustard. No, they just have the mainstream basics. Combine this with extremely mediocre service. I will never eat there again.",-1,-1
"Ordered the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and it was still frozen in the middle.  FROZEN! I couldn't believe it; it took them a long time to have my order ready but still manage to not cook it all the way.  I didn't realize it was frozen until I got back to work to eat it.  By then, I didn't have time to return to have them make me a new one.  This is an expensive place for just sandwiches only.  My Panini alone was over $8 after tax.  Not a good value because it doesn't even come with a drink or side.  I appreciate and support local businesses whenever possible but after this mishap, I won't be back.",-1,-1
Food is good and location is convenient. Service is terrible - even the owner - the older woman acts like its an inconvenience to help people. We have had the opportunity to give her more business but decided against it because of the service. Don't waste your time.,-1,-1
"I feel like this place has gotten worse over time, and it feels as every time I try to go back, they fail to meet the mark somehow. I used to frequent it when my work first moved into this area, about 4 years ago, but I think today was the draw for me. They forgot to include dressing with my $9 salad. Also, without the dressing, the chicken has a strange taste, almost questionable, which makes me wonder how it has tasted in the past...at least I got extra spinach. The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one. However, I expect better for the price they ask for their food. Today was my last visit and I will make sure to spread the word at work.",-1,-1
"I visited this restaurant because I got a groupon now deal. When I walked In and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was standing there at the counter waiting to be served..  Finally she said ""whenever your ready.."". I told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. That on its own turned me off because I hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me.  I don't feel like I am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses.   As I was standing waiting for my food I overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while I was standing there! Rude!   The older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. He is the only reason I am giving two stars.   The food on the other hand was decent. Too bad I won't ever becoming back just to be treated like I am bothering them.. next time I will just eat mcdonalds breakfast like I wanted anyways.",-1,-1
"Golden Krust is decent Caribbean for fairly cheap prices.  If you don't have high expectations for service or want to be ""wowed"" with food, you won't be too disappointed.  On both occasions, I've had the dinner combo ($8-$10).  The food itself is pretty good.  I had the Jerk Chicken and the Curry Goat, both of which were not too spicy. The plates are served with generous helpings of rice and red beans and another side, usually steamed cabbage or collards.  The meat portions was kinda slim.  But the service?  A total take-a-number-and-wait-for-me-to-move attitude pervades this place.  The line was long and the staff were slow to move.  Geez!  My buddy and I sat in the back dining hall, which they closed off with a wet floor sign as they were closing in an hour.  RUDE!  I had to walk around it to get a drink refill.  If you want cheap Caribbean food for takeout, this might be a OK place.  I'm sure that there is a Caribbean joint with more personable service and exceptional food.",-1,-1
Food is just okay.. Their portion sizes for the amount you are paying is terrible.. You get more Styrofoam than food and I don't like paying $10 FOR Styrofoam. They need to give you a better value. If you are going to cut portions on the meats at least put a good portion of rice so you feel like you got something..  The ones in NEWYork are much better. imho,-1,-1
Bland food. I don't even know how you can make jerk chicken bland but they managed. The customer service is mediocre. I just recommend going elsewhere.,-1,-1
"I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and always received pretty decent service. The food is always tasty and never really found that service was an issue until my last visit. I had a Jamaican visitor and she want hard dough bread to go with our dinner. Now I could have gone a couple of different places but I chose the Bakery. I love this bread but I typically only eat it when in NY, Jamaica or Florida because I need my hard dough to be as fresh as possible.  While the seemingly nice woman was ringing me up I politely asked ""how old is the bread?"" Now I know this is called a bakery but everyone knows their baked goods are shipped in. She responds by saying ""the bread is fresh."" I say your idea of fresh and mine maybe 2 different things. She became a maniac but in a calm way. She asks: do you want the bread or not? At the time I really just needed to get the bread and leave, dinner was waiting. But not before I explained that as a consumer and patron of this store I have a right to know how old something is in a darn bakery that doesn't bake anything.   After the fact, i was very upset because I could have gone somewhere else, and for her think that it was OK to respond in that manner bothered me. Why was she so combative in the first place? In the end, she told me their shipments come every Tuesday. So this would be the best day to visit if you need baked goods. I myself, will never spend another nickel there.",-1,-1
This place is NOT Caribbean food! It's terrible. You must ask for a drink separate from the combo even though you've ordered a combo. They're not going to offer it to you either. The food tastes horrible. I wish I could sit outside and turn people around to save their souls. But unfortunately this is all I can do. Take heed and go elsewhere!!!!!,-1,-1
The jerk sauce tastes like bbq sauce from a bottle mixed with ketchup! I should've known to keep walking when I didn't see any customers. Never again.,-1,-1
"It has been awhile since I've been to Golden Krust and I remembered this place being pretty good but things have sadly changed. Walking into the restaurant it was extremely humid and hot so I assume the air condition was not working. My family and I proceeded to order since we were starving. We ordered the Curry chicken with rice and beans and cabbage, Oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage and Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage. We also added 2 spicy beef pattys, they did not have any more regular beef pattys, I was disappointed. With it being so hot in the restaurant I wanted a Large ice water BUT their fountain drink machine was not working and they did not have any bottle waters. The only drinks that were available were bottled juices that I was not interested in. So I walked over to Shane's to buy a large drink. After returning with my large drink in hand my family and I ate dinner. The curry chicken was my favorite out of all the entrees we ordered but I was disappointed in my plantains were very soggy and not fried long enough. The oxtails disappointed me the most. They were not seasoned and did not really have a taste. Overall my experience here was just ok, I hope Golden Krust improves the obvious issues and bring back the original Golden Krust.",-1,-1
"Was given three prices for The ox tail combination additionally they did not have any fountain drinks or ice had to pay an extra dollar for a canna Coke in addition to the meal that should have included a drink, according to the menu",-1,-1
This food was not my favorite I spent about $12 and barely ate any of it. I went on my lunch and was driving and eating very disappointed. I may try this place one more time in hopes of better flavor.,-1,-1
"Ive been going here for yrs ...as a NYer I'm familiar with the chain. The foods good but I'm never going back. They've lost me and numerous family members. I wonder if they changed management or something because their portion sizing are horrendous! Theyve scaled back so much and still charge the same thing! I'm not paying for Styrofoam! Then if you ask for more rice you get told ""no!""  What kind of service is that?! I got a whole lot of gravy though! Ugh theyre rude too! Now the food Id rate a 4...maybe 3.5. But the service and portions a 1. Shame I stopped getting plates and stuck to beef patties but then they stopped serving cheese beef and never bothered to have them again or remove it from the menu. Ill be going to the other Caribbean restaurant up the street from now on.",-1,-1
"TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card payment  I was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot.   Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele.   I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews.   While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest.   My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.",-1,-1
"I ordered carne asada, fish, & chicken tacos. Tacos are really small & over cooked. Was really disappointed, expected a lot based on the reviews I read. You're better off going to a taco truck. I really hate how over priced tacos are now. Wouldn't mind paying $2-3, but at least give me what I'm paying for.",-1,-1
I used to love their ala carte menu...now they have all day buffet very bad and stale food.....avoid at any cost....we can't even order ala carte. ....,-1,-1
"I have been to the Scarborough location and had a decent experience. I took my family here (12 people) after calling ahead and being ensured that there would be minimum wait time. When we reached here the line was out of the door but we were told it wouldn't take long.  After 45 mins(!!!) of waiting we finally got a place to sit. We were happily looking forward to some tasty masala dosas. Well that's the first thing your order at a Dosa place right? Well guess what, they ran out of potatoes.... You can have a palak paneer dosa sir, our server said. Well I didn't come here and wait 45 mins to eat a palak paneer dosa. We walked and instead of having a nice time at dinner, we ate greasy Domino's pizza instead.  Interestingly upon further investigation, I discovered some older reviews with the same experience. I wish I had read them before. At this point I don't want to set foot in at least this location of Saravana Bhavan. I might consider giving the Scarborough location another shot. With so many options around, please do yourself a favor and go to some other South Indian place in Mississauga where they don't run out of potatoes....",-1,-1
"Terrible service - they can't handle pressure Food served cold. Sambar that's key to a South Indian Dosa meal must always be served hot but was served cold. Their excuse for cold sambar was that they're just preparing it because of the rush. Shouldn't that mean the sambar should be hot?!?  And their servings for sambar are too small. They skimp on the chutneys.   We'd ordered a Kara dosa which they got wrong. Not authentic at all.   Hot coffee served cold. And when we asked for it to be brought back and served hot we got a lame excuse that the milk was just poured fresh, what fresh from the fridge?!?  When they did take the coffee back, it never was served again. And we still got billed for it. We asked for water several times.  Not served!!!  They finally brought out a jug of water as we were putting on our jackets to leave.    This is the 3rd time in as many months that I've made the mistake of coming here. But no more.    This place sadly does not have its act together and gets a big fat zero in both the food and service department. One of the staff even have the excuse that cold food is a 'kitchen problem'. Hello, is management listening.    With this sort of customer service I seriously wonder why the place is busy or popular. If I could I would give them negative marks. One things for sure., they've lost an avid foodie customer.",-1,-1
Had heard so much about Saravanna Bhavan- we just moved here from California and was excited to give this place a try. The service was non-existant...it was as if they were doing us a favour by serving us lunch. The supposedly spicy 'kara' dosa was tasteless and the potato stuffing inside was a violent red colour- using red food colour does not make anything spicy people! My friend ordered another dosa which was so greasy that it had no taste but stale oil. The thali looked OK but tasted zilch. The little bowls that the sambar came in...that was a mystery...some of them were stuck inside the other- probably the dishwasher could not get them separated- so basically that meant that the lower one was dirty. When we complained the server mumbled something and then never showed his face.  Never going back here again,-1,-1
How many of you are aware that you get charged 10% gratuity on your bill plus 13% HST on the tip amount?  I am not aware that this automatic gratuity mentioned in the menu card. Can someone advise  if this is legal?  Anyway I think it is a dishonest practice. I am really disappointed.,-1,-1
"So I'll start by saying I had a terrible experience at the flagship location in Chennai, India in 2005. Since then, I swore off coming to this place ever again (no matter what corner of the world).  So after successfully boycotting this restaurant for 12 years, I was forced into going on a recent family dinner.   Now I'll tell you why I will not go back again:  1. They sat us directly next to the cash and a waiter just hovered outside of the register directly behind my seat. Table was not clean!   2. We were a party of 6 and received 3 menus. When I asked for an additional 3 menus, I was handed one without a word and the waiter walked away. Another one walked by and I asked for an additional two menus and was asked why I couldn't share and rolled her eyes?! (Ummm ok)  3. Six people, 5 spoons. It was a mission to get another spoon.   4. One of our appetizers came after our mains because we asked if it was coming (I'm guessing they forgot to put in the order)?   5. Not enough napkins. We asked for more and got 2. (Maybe they're saving money by reducing napkin waste?!)   6. Had to ask four times for extra sambhar before getting any.   Overall, the food was not anything special. There are many other dosa places that serve far better quality food and actually care about their customers. The service is horrendous. We went on a Monday evening around 6pm. They were not busy and many servers were just hanging around chatting with each other. When interacting with customers they behave in a manner that leads me to believe that the customer is a burden and they are not interested in ensuring a positive experience.  Thank you for reminding me why I had not eaten here since 2005 and why I should never eat here again.",-1,-1
"Dosa is sometimes seen as a delicacy. Most do not make this at home. So when looking for a dosa fix, and a proper one, I have tried to come here.  I came here about 3 times this year.  The service is minimal. You get your food, which comes in small portions, and you get out. You pay at the counter at the front. So that kind of tells you what type of set up this is.  Zero ambiance. hard cold seats, storefront setting, in a plaza. Walls peeling.   It is all veg food - no meat.   The dosa was barely filled. I mean, barely. I would say two tablespoons of filling in the large paper dosa.  I would rather go to Annjapar a bit further south.",-1,-1
Good value for food however I have always had an issue with their cleanliness. Overall not super clean but ok. Food quality is ok. Overall value 5/10,-1,-1
On the name of Chennai's Saravana Bhawan we visited here three to four times but not good as other branches are. Last time visited Delhi's Saravana Bhawan and it was really good. We can't even compare this Saravana to Delhi's Saravana. I didn't liked there sambar and dosa was not crispy at all even filter coffee was like Tim Hortons! Also the thali is limited... Can you imagine?!? For the first time I experienced this kind of thing... We just needed 1 extra poori and for that only we had to pay. We visited Bahrain's Saravana also... Even that branch is also far better than this one!,-1,-1
"Been here a couple of times and it was ok for most part. Not spectacular. The food has been ok, but we've always had good service. Returned last week with baby in tow, only to find no changing table in bathroom of this ""family"" friendly restaurant. Not returning.",-1,-1
"I am a huge fan of Guru Lukshmi and they set a really high bar for dosa in GTA. Unfortunately, Saravanaa Bhavan was a big letdown. We went in pretty late on a sunday afternoon. The decor has been recently upgraded which gives the place a clean modern look although it is still based in a strip mall.   Most tables around us were having the thali which should have given us some strong signals.   We ordered the vada sambar but the quality of the sambar was not good. The vada was not crispy as well which let the whole dish down.   The onion and chili utappam was the biggest disappointment. It was so thick and dry inside that after a few bites we just did not have the appetite to finish it. The chillies were huge and it was quite a task to remove them from the almost thick pizza crust like utappam.   The saving grace was the onion rava dosa but they had stuffed pepper in it which was annoying since it was quite strong. The accompanying chutney portion is too small and they were not flavorful at all.   I am never going back again! Go spend your money at Guru Lukshmi. I am surprised they are a global chain with such poor quality of south indian food.",-1,-1
Disappointed ! They don't seem to function to the level they built up their restaurants in Chennai. They don't have a clue about the importance of ambience in a restaurant . Sacha,-1,-1
"This is the worst place to have South Indian food whatsoever. I am a South Indian myself and wanted to take one of my colleagues to try south indian food.  Initially I thought of Guru Lakshmi but then I decided this place as Guru Lakshmi tends to get way busy. I have tried Saravanaa Bhavan in Dubai and this place comes nowhere close to it.  I ordered dosa and madras coffee. The coffee came before the dosa. I requested the server to give the coffee a little later as it would get cold before the dosa would even arrive. But guess what, the server plainly refused. I didn't want to create a scene in front of my colleague. Finally the dosa arrived and guess what again, it had hair on it. Yes the dosa that I wanted my colleague who never tried south indian food in his life, was trying it for the first time and the dosa had HAIR on it !!!  At this point I was going to almost lose it. But I kept my calm and requested it to be changed and hoped that there would be no cockroach.  Totally ruined my experience and I'm sure my colleagues as well.   Please folks go anywhere to try south indian food but not here. For the same price you will get better south indian cuisine with NO HAIR in it !",-1,-1
went there for dinner last night. Service was average. Food was horrible. Sambar and Chutney tasted bland. Dosa was tasteless.  Won't be visiting them soon.,-1,-1
"Saravanaa has gone on a steep downhill trajectory over the past few years in food quality and service. The only upgrade as of now is the restaurant itself. A few months ago it was very unattractive, almost cafeteria style, with hard seats like you would find in a food court. Kudos to them for getting a massive facelift. I wish I took pictures, but it looks lovely inside. They even have an electric fireplace (for some reason) in the tiny entrance.   But ambiance aside, the food itself did not get a similar makeover. I will never again order a masala dosa from this place. There was a mere SMEAR of potato bhaji, a few tablespoons at most, in my dosa. The chutneys were pretty bland and also in small amounts. The best thing was the sambar, spicy and warming. The dosa itself was very oily.  My dad had the Saravanaa Special Meal, which consisted of ten TINY dishes (curries, chutneys, curd and a gulab jamun), rice, two papad and two pooris. As is the apparent custom here, the poories were miniscule. They were baby poories. I mean, how much are they saving really by cutting the quantity of their menu items?   And it's not like this place isn't hopping. We got there at 7pm for dinner and already a queue had formed. This was the trend for the rest of the night, and people even crowded outside and left when they were told it would be a half an hour wait.  The waitstaff were pleasant enough, although our server tried to take away my plate before I had finished. They also left the front door open for a while, telling us ""the air conditioning was not working"". It is necessary to note that it was 10 degrees tonight, not a balmy summer at all.   This restaurant is NOT good for groups. There are tables of 4, and they can put a few together if needed. But do not come in with a group of 15, like people did tonight, and assume you will get a table quickly. Check ahead of time if you can make reservations.  My mom had the best meal tonight, the Mini Tiffin. It came with uppama, mini idlis in sambar, a mini dosa (with probably the same amount of bhaji as my dosa!) and a sweet. The sweet sheera was delicious, with cashews and raisins. Sad I didn't go for that.  PROS: - nice ambiance, comfortable booths - delicious, spicy sambar  CONS:  - oily dosas with virtually no filling - crowded early, stays that way through dinner - NOT good for groups (call ahead) - hasty servers who do not consider the weather - miniature food",-1,-1
"We usually go to Anjappar Chettinad one weekends when I have a strong craving for a South Indian breakfast. My review is going to be a mild comparison of the two.  We decided to try Saravan Bhavan a few days ago as I like trying different options.  The breakfast buffet on Sunday is from 10-12 and we had arrived at 11:10 to quite a line up. We were seated at 11:30.  The first thing I noticed was that the dosas, idlis and vadas are much better than anjappar and are really well made. The sambhar and tomato chutney is delicious as well.  One of the reasons I crave this breakfast is because I love Rava Kesari and Payasam. The rava kesari was quite tasteless and the payasam seemed to have been thickened with starch rather than reduced the way it should be.  We asked for two coffees as we noticed that there were no beverages in the buffet area (In comparison, anjapar has coffee that you help yourself to) and they brought us two very small coffees that were quite good. We didn't know until it was time to pay the bill that each of the 150 ml coffees were $2.25 each adding $4.50 to the total.  For two people with coffee the bill came to $29.90 plus tip.   I have rated it two stars because of the overall experience - food, service and pricing.   Final verdict: Liked- vadas, dosas, idly, sambhar and taste of the coffee Disliked: Service, wait time, pricing, poor tasting deserts, overall experience.   Won't return.",-1,-1
New Management is crapy. Quality of food very low. Used to a big fan of this restaurant but will not recommend it to anybody. Please dont eat there.,-1,-1
This is a poor version of this esteemed franchise. Sambhaar lacked any tamarind and looked and tasted like daal. Chutneys were also subpar. The dosa was strictly ok. The Scarborough branch is much better. Very disappointed.,-1,-1
"I love a good fixin' of dosa every now and then. When I do have it, I always go in with expectations (which I'm working on) of the dosa rice crepe itself having to be crispy, the potato filling has to be spicy and spread evenly inside the dosa crepe.   Craving dosa, I went to Udupai first (one of my favorite dosa restaurants) but they were closed on a Tuesday for lunch! Hence, I ended up coming to Saravanaa Bhavan due to proximity & time crunch. I guess it was a good excuse to try it out.   Here's what I found at Saravanna Bhavan:   -Mom and I ordered 2 Spicy Kara Dosas. We found them to be rather soggy and oily  -The potato filling was blood red in color, making me think they had added in a ton of food coloring  -The dosa crepe was overly thick -Chutney's were okay; however they really skimped on it. I also found that the chutneys were rather inconveniently served to the left into three portions of the thali (steel square plate) -The sambar was okay; nothing special. For some odd reason unbeknownst to me, they had used 2 katoris (small steel bowls) which were stuck together to serve the sambar in  -As for service, there was only one person serving when mom and I went here for lunch making service slow.   Sure it was decently priced; but the quality of food and service was worth WAY LESS than the $8 we cashed out for each dosa. Unfortunately, food and price do not go hand-in-hand here.",-1,-1
Average! They could do so much better. No exceptional flat ours. Poor is were way too small. Only redeeming feature was the pappadums.  Service is attentive but we have had much better South Indian.,-1,-1
"I went here to have authentic south Indian food, however I was very disappointed. Also the quality of food is low compared to their Scarborough location. If you are looking for authentic South Indian food, I would not recommend this place.",-1,-1
Are you kidding? I waited in line for 45 minutes when they said it was going to be 15! We got in and turns out there were no potatoes. I mean I can't believe their service! Worst part is the management though. This isn't the first time this has happened looking at other reviews. If there was a way this would be getting a 0 star!!!,-1,-1
"Check your bill! The restaurant adds 10% gratuity without clear disclosure. I added a 20% tip on top. In effect, I paid 30+% for service. And, adding insult to injury, this happened to be at the weeekend brunch buffet with minimal table service. The non-disclosure is deceitful.",-1,-1
"Poor service. Watered down sambhar! Cold idly and poori!! I have been coming here for past 2 years. There was never once when I had received good service. The server working there seems like he hates his job. He's been working there for as long as I dined there.  The dosa is average. However! The idly and poori always arrives at our table cold. The poori is so hard that it's barely edible. 50 % of the times, you will get good sambhar. But 50 % of the times you will get sambhar that is watered down and looks like water too.  I really hope they improve their service and food. Don't serve the stale and hard poori to your customers!",-1,-1
"I will never return to this place! They made us wait for 20 minutes even though there were rows of empty tables. Then when seated, again another 15 minute wait and I had to ask to be served. We had a pretty simple order-2 people, 4 items. They managed to mess it up. Food took forever to come and one item was missing. When I asked for the item the wait staff denied I had ordered it-their computer clearly confirmed otherwise. The manager came by and said 'sorry we can't handle the crowd.' Um...you're running a restaurant with a certain number of seats. What are you doing if you can't handle the customers? And to boot-they offered us a free dessert (which we didn't want) but didn't take a penny off the bill.  The food was mediocre. Stay far far away from this place. I'm sure there are better places for a dosa craving.",-1,-1
"I have been here thrice...not because I am a fan...but because this place serves decent south Indian food... Fellow yelpers who have ever tried at their outlet in Connaught Place, New Delhi...will call it below average but you can't expect same standard everywhere! Can you?  Service Wise: It's slow and when the restaurant is busy...expect slower service. I went here on this Ugadi. It was packed and they forgot my order. Two gentlemen on my table finished their thali and I got my tomato uttapam when they were done.   They have good servers...warm and soft spoken...but expect slow service!  Food: Decent/ Average/ OK..Thalis are ok...so it the idli/wada combo and Uttapams. Its not at all an expensive place  Ambiance: Please don't expect much",-1,-1
We went here on Saturday evening and I wanted to order Kara dosa which they did not have. We ordered mix veg dosa and tomato onion uttapam and requested they make it in ghee which they refused.We had previously come here and they had made our dosas in ghee.The sambhar was cold and when we asked for another one that was cold too.Worst sarvanna bhavan in the world.I have been to Dubai and London locations which are much better than here and have more variety of dosas.,-1,-1
Today I went to sarvana bhava with my family at scarborough location this is one of the worst sevice I got I went with my infant baby (I had requested a seat in corner for my baby but the waiter was very rude he was more interested in accommodating other guest though place was relatively empty) and the service was pathetic. waited half an hour for tandoori paratha after finishing fist one and which never cameI wont recommend this place for anyone,-1,-1
"I took my 2011 Q5 in for a LOF (Lube, oil and filter). Went to pick up the car and was told it was $250 for the invoice, including a $72 charge to reset the service light which was not quoted. BTW this is like a 5 minute procedure that they charge you 30 minutes to do.  I'll never go back there.   I went to Midtown Audi in Agincourt previously and had excellent service. I didn't go back there because it takes weeks to get an appointment.   I was able to get into this dump the same day, now I know why!!!  Avoid this place!!!!!",-1,-1
"The worst service dept experience. The two people i dealt with  were defensive  dismissive and rude when posed simple questions. Especially on cost of items,In this case tires. There was a price difference of over two hundred dollars between tires and install between downtown and audi dealers north of city.  This was a second chance  for audi downtown for me because of a previous visit  that went bad and the manager called to apologize then and said give us a chance so we will make it right.  Sorry  i will never go there again.",-1,-1
"They are quick to overcharge you and collect your money but crap on customer service. I would expect more from a dealership that represents such a great brand. Paid just over $1000 for my yearly service. They called me to ask if I could come back to collect some touch up pens. I refused to battle traffic so they sent it with their shuttle driver. My accountant needed the invoice for the original purchase of the car. Spoke with Chloe on a Monday who said she would send it via email. Waited one day-no invoice. After 4 phone calls with multiple messages,  I had to be insistent that something so simple be escalated to the attention of the manager. If they can't handle something so simple, I don't know how they handle the intricacies of fixing European car. Worries me a bit. I was also told that they would have to go onto their stock room to find invoice. That could've been communicated in a professional way well before the fourth phone call. Not respectful that people are busy. I would avoid and go to another dealership.",-1,-1
"This place is horrible with the worst service ever!  The sales reps were very attentive when I came in to buy my car. After that, every time I came in for service was a nightmare. I made an appointment for service just this afternoon, and I came in at 2 pm, then I've been waiting for more than 2 hours for the service to be completed! I was told that they would arrange a shuttle service to get me home, and I've been sitting in the lobby waiting forever ! Then the last time I checked with them, they told me that where I live, which is Bloor and Dufferin, which is practically still downtown, is too far, so they can't drive me home, but they can drop me off at a subway station. Then the guy promised me to drop me off at Young and Bloor, and told me their driver was outside and would be back in 5 mins, then I continued to wait, for another 45 mins until my car's ready, and I drove home. I am extremely unsatisfied with the service, because of that, I need to re-arrange my plans for the afternoon. The guy at the desk was like "" It's been crazy today. There's nothing we can do"". If you are considering getting an Audi, I strongly recommend you getting your car at other dealers. The service here was unacceptable. I also came in once because I noticed the drive's side mirror didn't change angles when I back up, and it supposed to. I had to explain it over and over again, but they failed to fix it for the first 2 times. Overall, I am so disappointed with the service, now that my warranty is expired, I don't think I'll ever come back.",-1,-1
"This Audi Downtown just opened a few weeks ago with a large showroom but horrible service.  I made an appointment for service last week and waited 30 minutes in line for the attendant to process the paper. Because they couldn't repair a tailight bulb last week, I had to return today to repair the matter. There were 2 customers ahead of me when I arrived at the appointed 9:30am, the same service personnel was handling matters.   Get this: it took 35 minutes for the guy to serve these 2 customers and he wasn't even done (he was supposed to simply take their keys, note the issues, print an order sheet). He was wasting time chatting with one customer about the pros and cons of PC Windows when there are customers waiting. He didn't even acknowledge my existence or simply inform me to wait. Giving up, I placed my car keys on his desk and spoke with WIlliam Yip, the manager, who said he would handle it.  The facilities are nice but extremely short staffed and the guys at service do not know how to prioritise or customer service!",-1,-1
"I liked the service when I purchased my car as sales rep was patient and knowledgable. I got a good deal on my car, and he even gave me winter mats. But when you're bringing your car in for maintenance or repairs, you won't get the same kind of service. Things rarely get fixed and you will be told everything is working as intended if you complain about abnormal behaviours. I once took my car in for alignment, and the car still didn't drive straight! Then I was told it's due to angle of the pavement. I can't wait to get ouf the lease and dump this dealer for good! I love audis, but I will take my business to Markham dealer.",-1,-1
"This dealership has the worst serve department I have ever dealt with. Their service advisors are defensive, they avoid necessary repairs and don't listen to or follow-up on problems. I had so many issues I had to contact Audi Canada to get them to intervene. Finally I got the needed repair but when I went in for it I was faced with the same problems, lack of advisors so it delayed the process of registering the vehicle for service, and there was no apology for all of the delays.  This deanship continues to do damage to the Audi brand. I wonder if Audi Canada will ever step in.",-1,-1
These guys are a disgrace.  Have no clue about customer service at all and treat people like garbage. Without getting into a long story I've had an issue with my brand new car that I just got in April that they insist is working.  Ignored me completely for the past 2 months.  Workday return my call.  They have now refused to even service my car there.  WOW!  I wouldn't give them a cent of my money if I were you. I now have the media after them.  No one needs to buy a new car and go through all this b*******. Stay far away from this place. DISGUSTING!,-1,-1
Really cool layout. The beer garden is a nice additional too. But the service was not great. The waitresses were sitting at tables. One was counting her tips and another was eating food and sitting with friends. The beers are alright. I wish the experience was better it's a cool atmosphere. Won't be back though.,-1,-1
"Husband and I stopped in around 4:00 on a Sunday to try a beer or two while visiting Phoenix. Two employees were inside, one of whom was talking/flirting with a patron at the only occupied table inside (one other table was occupied outside). Neither employee in any way acknowledged either of us. We reviewed the beer leaf for a minute or two, still with no acknowledgement from any of the staff, no hello, no invitation to find a seat etc. felt extremely pretentious, and not our scene. We left and were much happier and better-accommodated at Four Peaks.",-1,-1
It was just okay. Nothing special. A little small and none of the beers blew me away. It's a nice little neighborhood brewery that would be great if you live within walking distance.,-1,-1
"The beer is pretty good and the food truck there is always great.  I am giving this review because they are obviously short pouring their customers.  You will note their glasses are exactly 16 ounces if they are pouring over.  They do offer some beers at a 13 oz pour but even when you get the 9 oz, 13 oz, 16 oz pours you will often get short pours for every single one of them.  I have been there over a dozen times now and easily over half of my drinks have been this way.  After a dozen visits I would say service is 60% good, 20% meh, and 20% bad.  I know it may seem minuscule to some but when you are buying premium product there should be pride in the company to give the customer what they are offering. Although they have good beer being ripped off leaves a bad taste in mouth and there are plenty of other breweries that offer just as good of beers if not better and do not rip their customers off.",-1,-1
"Oh my did this place not live up to the hype.  It was heinous how sloppy our rolls came out, my date's food came out a full 20 minutes after my own, and the black cod was incredibly salty.  The place looked ""hip"" but that's about as cool as it got.   If you are looking to make a fashion statement then by all means dress yourself up and head to Muramoto, if you are looking to enjoy your meal (be it tapas, sushi, real japanese or some fusion) look elsewhere.",-1,-1
"Pretty rude staff when I pointed out little mistakes on my nails. Also weren't happy about fixing my nails after only 12 hours and gel nails chipping.  The gel nails which usually last me 2-3 weeks bc my nails grow slow, are now ruined and have only been 8 days",-1,-1
"WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! Unprofessional. Disloyal. Rude. Lazy. After giving this place and my nail tech Kim business for over a year, I was turned away today because I like my nails buffed too much. Seriously? You mean you don't want to ""work"" for the money I pay you. WTF? I've never been so insulted. And I'm not even a difficult client. In the year I've been going here, Kim has barely said two words to me (which is Ok. I just want my nails done). I continued to go back week after week because she was good. Six months ago I walked in without an appt and let someone else do my nails. Mistake. She cut me and the buff was awful. Kim actually stepped over to finish the job. And I tip well for good service.   So understand how floored I was when I was told today Kim doesn't want to work on me any more. I was told her arm hurts too much after buffing my nails and she feels awkward. You're kidding, right? Now, if I was a jerk customer; demanding, loud, lousy tipper, etc I can see it. But I'm none of that. In fact, when I find what I like, I'm loyal. And I've been loyal here. And I pay without complaint. And I tip well, always. That's why I'm so pissed to have been turned away because the job is too difficult. That's just lazy! Yes, L-A-Z-Y!!! You perform a service. I pay you money. I have the right to be particular. You have the responsibility to do your job well. Today, they lost a customer and a fan. What happened today was BS.   I will NEVER recommend this business. I'm disappointed I can't give a zero star or negative star rating. Fancy Nails gets a big middle finger from me!",-1,-1
"I read reviews about this salon that were mixed so I decided to try it for myself. I called prior to actually going to the salon to find out prices as well as make an appointment. The girl who answered the phone took about 5 minutes to figure out what the cost of a basic pedicure was. Then I scheduled an appointment for 11am on Sunday. I get there just before 11 and no one greets me, I finally get the attention of the girl who answers the phone and let her know I have an 11am appointment for a pedicure. She says oh okay pick a color and we'll be right with you. I wait 10 minutes, then they have me sit in a pedicure chair. Another 15 minutes waiting for someone to finally become available to do my toes.  Holly did a really great job, but waiting 25 minutes after I made an 11oclock appointment is disappointing.  I go to pay and the girl who answers the phones also takes care of the payments. She seriously had no clue what she was doing. She asked me what it cost and I said $22 as It stated on the menu.  This girl up front really has to get it together, she is completely clueless. I am sorry to say I won't be back to this establishment.",-1,-1
"I have been having my nails done now for over 30 years, and over this time frame, I have lived in 3 different states. I had to go to several different shops here in Arizona, since moving here 17 years ago, before I found the right one. I was very happy at that salon for almost 10 years. During those 10 years, I went to the same nail tech,for about 8 of the 10 years,he did a great job, my nails lasted, and all was well!  For personal reasons I had to find a new salon. So I went to a new place, it had high reviews and I got a new set and a gel pedicure! Everyone was nice and all looked okay, but they were so SLOW I was there 5 HOURS!!...I couldn't imagine ever going back there again, they were closed for over an hour, and I was still in there , the ONLY 1 in there!.....Not fun!  So I was stressed after that  , and knew I needed to  find a new place so now I am in the present time, and brings me to my review here today.  I took my time,and for 2 weeks,  I really did my homework. I researched, googled. read reviews, and finally decided on where I would go.  I chose Fancy Nails & Spa on Cave Creek Rd in Phoenix.  I didn't just make an appointment either. After I was done with all my research , I called about  4 of  the salons,  and went in person,  to see the salons, and speak to them, as well, as look at there selections of powders / colors.  When I first called Fancy nails I spoke to the Owner David, he was very friendly. He offered for me to come in, and take a look, and told me they would take care of me, When I went to the shop, again he was friendly, I decided to make an appointment. For a new set and gel pedicure with Kim also eye brow wax. They didn't have the chunky/confetti powder that I am used to, but assured me they could order at a later time.My nails seemed okay, I was just glad to have them done, and have found a place, that I didn't  pay to close attention.As the holidays were fast approaching and I was very busy at that time. The gel pedicure was good looked nice. But I was a bit disapointed that my, toe nails were grown out so quickly, as I had said please make them extra short, I like them short. And even after she first cut them, I asked her to trim off more, glad I did, because they were still to long. I figured though it was my first time, so next time it will be better.  I always got compliments  on my nails, especially the last 10 years. Well all of a sudden no one is complimenting me?! I thought that is really strange?! After a couple days I looked harder at my nails and I could see every little mark under the pink area?...and it looked weird....they never looked like that before. . I had them use medium pink, same thing I had always used, for 10 years . Then still no compliments, and each day they looked worse... it was like you could see all the drill marks straight through it, on my nail beds. I went back to my next appointment because now new years Eve was here, and I had a party to go to. This time the same thing happened with my nails, and my pedicure also. Now my daughter is asking me whats wrong with my nails?...And even my husband!. They don't  look nice anymore, my husband says. I wanted to cry. So I called the nail salon and spoke to David the owner, he said come in and he would take care of me himself. So I did, and he said they needed to be removed, and cleaned up underneath, and a whole new set, and he would take care of me, and he did!...:) So now everything will be okay..right? wrong!!.... It helped,  But he had to drill my nail beds way way down a lot and it hurt real real bad to do that!...I had another pedicure by a different tech, once again I explained they were left to long  2 times, and I like them extra short,  make them very short. They said yes but, they did not. After 2 weeks ( and still no compliments) I was beside myself. So I made my appointment with David again, thinking Id try one more time. And when I got there I showed him all the drill marks on my nail beds. He then showed his daughter Hannah, and had her do my nails.She said would do back / fill and use ""her"" medium pink powder.  and it will cover all those marks. She then proceeded, without saying anything to literally rip off my finger nail, it hurt!. I pulled away, in pain, and said, no! you need to soak them off!..and she laughed!! and said I was sensitive and begin to rip again!.OMG!I couldnt believe it now there was BLOOD! and a huge throbbing pain she laughed again! I had tears It hurt for the whole time, she was not even sorry.When she was finally finished, They looked good, so I thought it might be Okay Well wrong again! 2 days later 1 nail was lifting!..I called Hannah.Can she please fix it? She said to busy!!..Maybe tomorrow!!?? I got really upset. Then she said ok come in.The owner David looked at it, he fixed it, and never said 1 word to me the whole time.I knew right then, I would not be returning. Next day another nail lifted and came off 1 by 1 til all are gone just shy of 12 days! OMG",-1,-1
"I'm a business owner myself. I made an appointment the day before to get a gel pedicure, and a back fill. The reviews I read were really great. I'd been seeing the same nail tech for 6yrs and never had I complained. However she moved to California. They put me with a guy that didn't speak any English. I get my pedicure & nails done every 10 days. this young man took 90mins doing nothing! He put callus remover on my feet and then place them in the water Hmmm... I wonder where he got his nail tech license? He didn't remove the skin or calluses on my feet after putting callus remover on them. The shape of my toenails are not the same or even. Oh! And he forgot to massage my feet!! Then the owner came over and told me that they're really busy and couldn't do my nails and could I come back tomorrow and he would do a very good job on my nails for me!!  I sat in that chair for 90 minutes frustrated with this moron that shouldn't be doing pedicures or any other kind of service. It was inadequate & way below average customer service. I watched the owner book appointments for ladies that just walked in with no appointment and ask them to come back in 20mins. Well I dealt with being stressed out by someone that was not properly doing their service then being told that they didn't have time to do my nails because they were too busy! I was charged $48 for something that I most certainly was not happy with. I told the owner to stick it up his A..  How can anyone be so rude I don't know? I wish there was a law or a requirement that in order to get your license to be a nail technician or to perform any kind of public service that every individual of any race needed to speak and understand The English language fluently before they were able to obtain their license!   I owned 2 hair salons in scottsdale and I don't ever recommend anyone going to fancy nails.",-1,-1
"Very disappointed with the pedicure I received. It was extremely rushed and lacked the sentiment of pampering yourself and relaxing. It was not meticulously done and there was nail polish left on my skin. I  can definitely do a better job myself.   In addition to that, the nail technician cut my big toenail at an angle to the inside on each side of the nail, and it looks absolutely ridiculous. It was only that one nail so my overall pedicure is inconsistent. I brought it to her attention even though there was nothing she could do to change it and she brushed it off and said that's how it's done.",-1,-1
"Terrible!! This was my first and my last time coming here. I came for a relaxing pedicure and dip powder manicure. I sat for my pedicure in between 2 ladies who were already well into their pedicures yet mine was done way before theirs. How is this possible when I got the same services they did? I asked them what pedicure they got and it was the same as me. Maybe because a guy was doing mine and he seemed to hate his job.  Hm... mine lasted about 15 minutes their pedicures lasted at least 30 - 40 if not more. Then I sit for my powder manicure. It was so bad I had the girl remove it. It took her 3 times of soaking my nails with the foil to get the gel off, that's how thick and awful it was. As I leave they charge me for my pedicure, ok fine, yes I got a pedicure, here's the kicker, she charges me $10 for a cuticle trim!! Are you serious? I left and immediately called my bank to dispute the charge. Worst customer service ever!!",-1,-1
My manicure was sub par and the owner was rude. He refused my Amex card only after seeing that I had other cards in my wallet. As if that wasn't enough he was rude about it claiming they charge him too many fees. I will not return.,-1,-1
"My GF and I ate at Fin's on Saturday night Sept 21, 2013.  We had the chef's special tasting box which had 9 different items. The honey topped eggplant was quite good but everything else was mundane at best.  There were rubbery little pieces of octopus with much chopped vegetables in a sauce that overwhelmed everything. There was spicy salmon which was not spicy and was overwhelmed by a massive amount of mayo.  The tuna was tasteless. Etc. In addition, the decor is primitive and the place is incredibly loud for a supposedly upscale restaurant. It is simply not a good restaurant and I would not return.",-1,-1
"warning. !!!!!!   This is not the same fin as before sold to new owner !   Super dry pull pork rice burger and stale sashimi salad and  gone bad chicken skewers were the 3 dishes ordered.    I gave 15% tip that the owner dared to ask for such food and service, smiled back at the owners and said ""see you next time"" NOT!",-1,-1
"Way too expensive for what you get. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place was not worth it. Was recommended by a friend after telling her how much I loved Guu but I definitely can't listen to her anymore!   It's a nice looking place and the service was good as well, but the food comes first and it definitely was lacking. Sashimi was on par with AYCE places, not what you expect when you pay 40 bucks for 16 pieces.   Overall, not pleased with my food experience.",-1,-1
"My husband and I went to Pazzo's for dinner during restaurant week.  We were both disappointed with our entrees.  We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  We both loved the lobster bisque.  My husband's crab ravioli was not warm.  My veal romano was hard and difficult to cut and eat.  My vegetable, carrots, were also not soft enough to chew. We enjoyed the ice cream for dessert.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  We may try Pazzo' s for lunch, but we wish we would have chosen a different restaurant for dinner.",-1,-1
"Overpriced and flavroless.  This place tries really hard to seem fancy, but falls far short.  The bread was fantastic, but it was paired with ice cold, solid butter.  The salad, as others mentiones, had very little nearly-flavorless dressing.    I had the chicken marsala ($18).  The three chicken tenders that comprised it were tender.  The sauce, however, was a mess.  It was as if they splashed some marsala wine on the plate, and then dumped the chicken onto the plate, oil and all, straight from the sautee pan.  It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning.  Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too.  I chose pasta with white sauce for the side.  Bad move.  It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt.  My wife had the shrimp scampi ($22).  It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big.  They weren't overcooked.  The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine.  The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*.  I don't think any of it was seasoned with salt or anything else.  She chose broccoli for her side.  Aside from the bread, the broccoli was the best part of the meal.  Come here if you're looking to spend $20 a plate for food that's below even Olive Garden's standards.  The service here was slow and unenthusiastic, and I'm willing to bet that none of the cooks have ever actually tasted the food they're sending out.  I only gave it two stars because the food did not make me sick.",-1,-1
"The perfect word for this place is: bland.   I had the eggplant Parmesan, which had too much breading & was bland.  Another person in our group had the Greek pizza, which was thin & crispy & bland.   On the bright side (I guess), the kids liked their chicken fingers because, hey, kids like their food bland!",-1,-1
"I can't comment on the food here because we didn't get that far. We were in a hurry on a Friday and there was an hour wait at Bonefish so we decided to try Pazzo because we wanted to since it opened. The parking lot was pretty empty and very empty inside. I guess now I know why. They seated us immediately and then nothing. We saw other waiters at other tables and people cleaning up and nobody even looked at us. It was like we were invisible. They weren't even busy. After almost 15 minutes we got up and left and my husband told the hostess we would not be coming back. I have never been ignored in a restaurant before but now, based on the reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste money on the food.",-1,-1
"Save your $22+/ plate & take yourself over to Giant Eagle's CafÃ©.   It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive at our table. The portions were generous, however nothing was seasoned properly. Shrimp Scampi was covered in garlic powder sitting in a bowl filled with microwaved butter. The broccoli was the best part of my meal. They were cooked to perfection. The salad that's given lacked any dressing. The dressing was bland. The beer is over priced. $9 for any craft beer. I could see if they had a 10% DuClaw on draft for Pazzo's to have a reason to charge that much.  The service is depressing. Servers don't smile here or seem enthusiastic. Perhaps it's because they feel guilty for being the poor souls to serve below average food for such a sky-high price.   The decor is nice. That's it. Now save yourself money and go to Chick-fil-A next door.",-1,-1
The wedding soup was so good! After eating that I was hopeful that the reviews on here weren't accurate... I'm sorry to say that they are true! I would come back for the soup but wouldn't eat dinner here again. We came for restaurant week and the menu looked amazing but the actual food was pretty poor.,-1,-1
I completely agree with Kimberly said. BLAND CITY!!!  Hopefully my dogs will like the leftovers. But I doubt it.,-1,-1
"First time at this restaurant for my birthday dinner which was less than memorable. Our entrance less than a.warm greeting by a young blonde girl at the host stand. ""Hi, just two of you?""not all that welcoming. Brought to our seat and was not informed of any daily specials. Was not presented a wine list but asked for one and got a not to impressive small list. Who has lambrusco on the menu? This place does. Opted for a mixed drink since wine choices were slim. Had the bruschetta. Appetizer. Nothing to write home about. Bland, no seasoning. Wife had pasta with salmon. Salmon was small tail end piece that was overcooked and dry. I had veal and peppers which was dredged in too much flour and not shaken off before sauteed. Asked for bread twice before i got three small slices that was told just came the oven, (cold). Asked for warm bread and finally got it as i was taking my last bite of veal. Also had to ask for water twice. Needless to say i had a subpar meal and terrible service. I usually give a place a second try but since both meals were average on a good day and no wine selection, we wont be back",-1,-1
"My wife and i went there for the first time on Saturday night, decided to sit at the bar. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the bartenders, even though it wasn't very busy. When a bartender walked by us without even saying hello, we decided to get a table.  A waiter named Brandon took care of us, but his service was mediocre. He had to be reminded that we had ordered a second drink, the food was just warm, and not very good. (Chicken asiago and veal marsala) He never asked us if everything was ok after the food was delivered, didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee, and didn't even say thank you after he returned the check after the payment was made.  Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at pazzo. We will not return or recommend it to our friends. It was overpriced for the quality of the food and service. Olive garden would be a much better value.",-1,-1
"The parking lot is always empty which isn't a good sign.  But still wanted to give it a try.  No hostess. Waited a few minutes before the bartender came out to seat us.  My menu was dirty. My silverware was dirty. Glasses spotty.  Come on guys. If you're slow and still can't keep things clean.....? Food was ok, but definately didn't live up to the prices. I am in the business and it makes me sad when a new restaurant doesn't do well.  These little details could easily be fixed.",-1,-1
"The worst dining experience I have ever had.  The food was decent, although some people in my party were unable to eat their's as it wasn't cooked thoroughly.    It took an hour and 20 minutes for us to get our drinks.  When they first started bringing out the drinks, the waitress mentioned she had not yet placed our dinner order, which we had given her an hour before.  Someone from our group searched out the manager and found him in a back corner of the restaurant hanging out (turns out he is also the chef).  He basically ignored them.  There was much confusion, wrong drinks were brought out, not all appetizers were brought out.  At 9:00 (we got there at 6:30) we couldn't find our waitress to get our checks.  Finally at 9:30 she appeared with all single checks.  Not all checks were there, and she basically just put them on the hostess stand for us to sort through ourselves.  A member of our party had to search out the manager, who said he was just about to come over and see how our meal was.  We had no signs of him until we had to search for him.    This was by far, the worst dining experience I've ever had.  Anytime I drive by, the parking lot is empty.   I can't imagine it will be open long.  If only the chef could back up his arrogance with his culinary skills.",-1,-1
"I really don't have too much to say other than the fact that I sent my food back and decided to just grab something to eat somewhere else.  Four of us went on a Friday night and were seated almost immediately.  Ordered drinks and 23 minutes later they show up.  Dinner was bland and not even italian food...  Pesto should at least have pine nuts and basil right?  Mine was tortellini with olive oil and parsley.  The service was slow and even after we complained no one came over to say a word or find out what they could have done better.   Oh, and a kettle one martini was 12.75  For ketel one and some vermouth.  WOW.   There is no way that the mgmt cares about this place based on all the other reviews.",-1,-1
"The food is very good.  But...... Bartender charged for a double. Should have been 6.50 but they charged 13.00. When we mentioned we didn't order a double, she said it was a computer glitch, but made no effort to reduce it. Asked for a manager, he offered to take off 4.00. Buyer beware!! They are sneaky and when they get caught, they are unapologetic.",-1,-1
"If you're going to charge $16 for manicotti and a $2 up charge for the WAY too salty wedding soup, I expect more... I have no problem paying for good food and if this food had been amazing, I wouldn't even mention the cost, but it's far from that. I normally get manicotti at Italian restaurants my first time there and maybe if I'd done that, I'd like this place more, but I doubt it, since there was barely any sauce with my crab ravioli and I didn't like the flavor. I know many people like bell peppers, but I'm not a fan. If I order crab ravioli, I expect to be able to taste the crab - the consistency of the crab was also very strange - it was mushy. My dad's linguine with red clam sauce barely had any sauce and the sauce that was there was SUPER runny - it looked more like died white clam sauce than red clam sauce. At least they used real clams, but neither of us were impressed. I wish Stone Pepper Grill hadn't closed.  I'm REALLY not a fan of the Olive Garden, since there are so many better Italian places, but I think the food is better there, you get more, and it's certainly not as pricey... Of course, there are many much BETTER Italian restaurants than that (like Pasta Too, etc.), but if I'm saying the Olive Garden is a better choice, you know the food was not very good.  A couple more thing I forgot to mention in my review... I had to practically beg for parmesan cheese and what I got wasn't fresh or even nicely grated from a container... It was the same kind of parmesan I have at home (though probably not even Kraft... ha ha ha...) it was in a dish and they spooned it on for me. I didn't even get any to go with my soup, since I didn't want to ask for it then. No cheese was EVER offered.  They seem to turn their air conditioning completely off instead of down when the restaurant is closed, so it was INSANELY HOT in the restaurant until we were almost ready to leave (we went there for an early dinner, since I met my dad right after work to avoid traffic). Someone should explain to them that this actually costs them MORE money and it makes guests uncomfortable, so it's bad on all fronts.   AVOID this place at all costs. Here's hoping they don't last long so a better restaurant can open there.",-1,-1
"Review is based on service and bar only - did not order food.   Place was empty on Friday night. First warning sign.  My wife and I sat at the bar to order drinks and contemplate dessert. It was ten minutes before our order was taken. Second sign. Drinks were poured, took five minutes to find a lime for my wife's drink. Third sign.   We decided to skip dessert. We could tell as we looked around, wait staff was poorly trained and disorganized. This place needs help. Beautiful interior, and like I said - did not try the food. But with the number of good Italian places in Pittsburgh, come on - need to up your game!",-1,-1
"First impression is that this place is very clean but a little confusing- you walk in and see a buffet-type set up, but it's not being utilized and looks like there's a lot of junk around the kitchen area. I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings.  Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird.  Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything.",-1,-1
"I don't normally write reviews, but this place is just no good. The principle Cathy Endy is rude, I don't think someone like her can run a children's school. My son went there for a little bit, he didn't learn anything! What a waste of money.",-1,-1
"Very disappointed. Less than 6 months after installation and setup, the cameras can no longer be viewed away from home.",-1,-1
"Not sure where to start with these guys as they did seem very interested in installing a camera system in my home, their sales rep that came out even appeared very knowledgeable about their craft. A week later I followed up with them to see if they had come up with an estimate and was informed that they didn't have my contact information. When I finally did get the estimate it left off things we discussed and seemed a bit high, so I replied asking for clarification. Again a week went by with no reply until Jeremy contacted me to ask if I received their estimate, when I told him I had but had some questions and that I had replied to their original email asking for clarification. As we started to go over my questions I was informed that Chris was now out of town and Jeremy would have him contact me when he got back. Again a week went by with no contact until a third person called to follow up and see if I ever got the quote? I told the third person that I had and discussed it with Jeremy the prior week and I was still waiting to hear back from Chris, I was told he would follow up. As it turns out Chris did call a few minutes later but he didn't use my home number so his call went to voicemail. Never did talk with Chris but yet a fourth person called after another couple of days to follow up on the original quote. As I stated at the beginning they do appear very capable of doing a first rate job, but I will never know as their follow up to questions was basically nonexistent as their only real follow up was to ask for the job not answer any of my question and when we are looking at a $6,000 camera install, they could take a few minutes to answer questions. Reading all their reviews it does appear that I'm in the minority but I get the impression they really have very little internal communication or perhaps my job was just over their head, I'll really never know.",-1,-1
"This sad excuse of a car dealership should either be shut down by Toyota or their manager should be fired. Has no one ever explained to these people that calls should be returned? I as well, have also caught them doing unnecessary work on my Camry. My new mechanic tells me it served me right going there!",-1,-1
"I'd give these guys negative stars if I could. I took my car in to get two engine sensors replaced, and after diagnosis, they handed me an estimate of approx $4000. That's the price of a new engine! I proceeded to tell them no, took my car to a mechanic that I know and trust (Heffner's Toyota in Kitchener) , and found out that this is a tactic that dealers use to get you to buy a new car. I wouldn't trust these guys to fix a lawnmower engine in the future. Be forewarned, this dealership is not to be trusted.",-1,-1
"I went there once...now they keep calling me to remind be about service using a 'blocked number"" - what a waste of my time and minutes. No legit business calls customers with a blocked number.",-1,-1
Adequate service if your car is under warrantee. My engine light has been on for a year. 3 visits (charged each time) they are still incapable of fixing it. Different excuse every time.  Pretty expensive even for an oil change. Long wait times even for the most straightforward repairs.  Not great at returning calls. There are better places unless you really want to get repairs at dealership. Not great service off warrantee.  I think I'll find somewhere else for service. Suggest you do too.,-1,-1
"This place is literally the worst. Hopefully the got rid of the awful management, because the owner is actually sort of nice. I ordered ice cream and just got a sloppy mess and no apology.",-1,-1
"I'm not sure what's wrong with the photo printer at this location, but my passport photos came out spotty and washed out. It's 15$ for 2 so they better be good!  The rest of the store is just a regular shoppers like any other. Sometimes they do samples.",-1,-1
"Wished it was better.. After watching man vs. food I decided to stop by, dÃ©cor was not that homey and welcoming, and the neighborhood was bad, but nothing I haven't been around before.  The ribs were very fatty and grisly, it was disappointing and I didn't get enough sauce and when I asked for a little more they wanted to charge me, the coleslaw was awesome!  I noticed a hair in my food and it turned me off to the rest of it, so i threw it away , I wont be returning... sorry guys",-1,-1
"Don't believe the hype. Nooooo!   In the Cleveland area, there's an endless supply of small, unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique, tasteful, hand-crafted items with flavor. Hot Sauce Williams has created a great commodity in his BBQ sauce, however, ruins the spirit of Cleveland goodies by serving it over generic, tasteless, frozen bag items.   Granted, my review is based off a Polish Boy sandwich combo. I haven't tried anything else and after trying the combo, I most likely won't make my way back to try anything else.   G Love sang about it, so it can't be that bad, can it? Can the creator of such gems as 'Cold Beverages' and 'Milk and Cereal' really steer me in the wrong direction? He did, however, I'll forgive him with a listening of 'Baby's Got Sauce' (pun intended?).   The fries are actually store-bought Ore-Ida brand fries. I can remember being served those with dinner when I was a lad in the late 1980s. They are perfectly tasteless. The sauce drenches over them, adding taste, but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something I can easily buy in the store, increase the price, and serve it to customers.    The buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you'd be getting exactly what is served.   The sausage wasn't bad, had some taste and was of average size (I'd throw in a 'that's what she said,' but that phrase is so overused, I'll let it be).   It isn't terrible, but to be honest, without the sauce, there's no way Hot Sauce Williams would still be in business after all these years. The cute nickname helps, I'm guessing. I'm guessing a lot of people wouldn't keep returning to a ""Mr. Williams Barbecue Restaurant"" - so I guess the gimmick is working. Plus, it'd be totally cool of Williams decided to sponsor a MMA fighter, just so there'd be a fighter with the 'Hot Sauce' nickname.   The service is, well, non-existent. I asked for 'slaw on the side, and when I received my meal, my 'slaw was in the middle, which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact. The 'slaw is mostly liquid. I was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of Ore-Ida fries, juicy 'slaw, BBQ sauce and bread.   Sort of weird, they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks.   I'd buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home, but I really wouldn't suggest eating here unless you're interested in a bland, sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest Piggly Wiggly (which, for Northerners, is probably pretty far away, so I'd have no clue why you'd travel that far to grab those simple ingredients).",-1,-1
Sauce spicy and blan absolutely no flavor the decor screams dont eat here plus the entire staff is moody not to mention chicken wings are 1.50 a piece a true rip off!,-1,-1
"The location on 79th Carnegie, is a hot ghetto mess. I am ashamed of what the establishment has turned into. Maybe I'll try out superior or Lee rd.",-1,-1
"Let me just start by saying that this place did not live up to the Man V. Food hype. I think I have been to better buffets before.  Terrible customer service earned them one out five stars. Extremely rude and inconsiderate server. Took us ten minutes to place our order when at the front of the line. She decided to have side conversations while we were still ordering.  Food: I ordered the Polish Boy and Dark Meat Chicken.   Polish Boy: Polish Sausage, Coleslaw, Fries, and BBQ sauce on a bun. It was drenched in sauce, making the bun soggy. It was not bad but was not all that. The sauce is not very good for BBQ. It is runny like Open Pit and has a little zing to it. Adam Richman was high when he said this sauce was incredible.  Chicken: Very good chicken, dark meat. The breading was very crispy and the meat was juicy. I enjoyed this part of the meal.  Overall, I would not return. No place should treat their guests with such arrogance and ineptness. I think I would rather take my money to Popeye's, its most comparable match.",-1,-1
"The food was okay. The wings and fries were not that fresh and very little chicken came on the bone. The sauce was ok. I like Open Pit Bar B Que's (Cleveland, OH) sauce better because it's sweeter. I tried this because it was on the travel channel. It really wasn't that good. I like Harold's Chicken Shack in Atlanta and Chicago way better when it comes to chicken and sauce.",-1,-1
I can't remember the last time I ate here because it has been that long. Well it will be my last... The menu on Yelp quotes one price so a slab dinner 19.95 when I pick up my food it's $29. The girl at the register rude even when you call in to order  tone very dry... Food over I should have saved myself the trouble and gas and just pulled out my own grill!,-1,-1
"My girlfriend and I been dying to try this place for sometime, but never found the motivation to go until we saw the Anthony Bourdain episode when he was in Cleveland. We ordered the Family Meal (Full Slab, 8 Pcs of Chicken and 2 sides). When we ordered most of the sides were not available so our choices were limited.  I've seen their slogan around town ""Voted #1 for Ribs"" so we were excited, but after taking our first bite into those saucy ribs, we looked at each other and said ""meh"" as we have had better. The chicken on the other hand, drenched in BBQ sauce, was interesting. It was saucy yet crispy so it was an interesting dish, we probably favor the chicken over the ribs. The family meal is large so make sure you have plenty of mouths to feed, as for us we'll need to hit the gym for the next several days to burn off the calories we just packed on.",-1,-1
Worst food I've ever had the laziest service. We ended up throwing 35 dollars in the trash. If you like getting sick or experience all time lows check this place out!,-1,-1
The polish girl was good overall but the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. The fried chicken was also a plus.,-1,-1
"All I can say is that both the food and the restaurant were completely disgusting. The pork shoulder tasted like it was two weeks old and reheated in a microwave. Their fries were cold and mushy. The cole slaw was the only edible thing they gave me. The whole meal was so bad I threw it in garbage after two bites. To go along with the terrible food the inside of the restaurant was dirty and had a strange smell. It's probably not necessary to say, but I will never set foot in Hot Sauce Williams again.",-1,-1
"So torn. I love their food. We wanted a polish boy. Yelp says open until 1:30, it is 10:26 pm and drive thru dude says they're closed. What? If you're normal and visit during normal hours, I gave hsw 5 plus stars. But consistence is nice too.",-1,-1
I went here on my lunch break and I waited for 20 minutes just for a polish boy! It was pretty good but waiting for the very slow and rude staff was frustrating.,-1,-1
This place was extremely unorganized. Orders came out slowly and at least half of it was wrong. The air conditioning must have been broken on our visit because it was over 90 degrees in the dining area. The food was pretty good and the only thing keeping this review from getting a one star. We ordered the rib tip sandwich but they came back 15 minutes later and said they were out so we ended up getting the pulled pork. While the food was good ( I would I say 8 out of 10) it wasn't nearly good enough to overcome the disappointment. We won't be back.,-1,-1
"I decided to stop by here to try the Polish girl sandwich featured on Man vs. Food.  The sandwich was tasty but the service is terrible.   Like others have said in there reviews, the service is extremely slow.  The waitresses walk slow, talk slow, and were inattentive.  It also took almost 30 minutes to get one polish girl and fish sandwich (because they ran out of the popcorn shrimp my friend wanted...) which is pretty slow to me.  Our waitress even disappeared during the middle of our service and it took us a extra 20 minutes to get our bill after we were done.  The restaurant is also an eyesore, the pink and light blue color scheme is even more offensive to the eyes in person.  I won't ever come here again but if you plan to come here, order to go!",-1,-1
"Manager, please delete this review after owner of Yelp has read . . . Thank you.  Well, let me tell you.  I love he food here!  However, I had a costly-to-owner and manager, and a terrible experience today (well, the 12th a Wednesday), and they need to know if they want to keep customers!!!  Who knows how many people just walk out because of the rude and slow staff - I'm sure they do it all the time and just don't tell the boss.  Here is what I am trying to communicate, and I can find no other way.  Website non-existent.   My would-be communique: You lost 3 customers in a row today, August 12, at about 4:30, including the 2 ahead of me and then me.  I would have spent around $20.  The two were mother and son, and who knows what a growing boy eats?!   The 2 in front of me (no one else in line or the restaurant) waited and waited even to be acknowledged let alone waited on.  There were 3 employees - a man and 2 women -who saw clearly we were there.  The customers and I chatted pleasantly for a good 5 minutes.  They got tired of waiting - for anything.  They left.  I was now the only customer.  One would think that their seeing 2 walkouts would have prompted them to action!   The 3 of them stood directly in front of me at the register!  They did everything to pretend I wasn't there.  Could they not have said ""we'll be right with you""?  Totally ignored me and instead counted tickets and chit-chatted about.  There was plenty of food, so they were in no crunch.  I'd have spent $20 - LOSS.  Mother and son, who knows? - LOSS.  I go to your place because it's usually great and I am a frequent Clinic visitor. Frankly, I would fire all three of these employees if I were you.  You've got a great business, but who knows how many customers walk out.  RUDE EMPLOYEES might be chasing away more than you know.   Susan Bednar",-1,-1
"Went late evening...door was locked this time. (Wasn't locked the last evening I went.) Parking lot full of cars that's not at restaurant. So I go to the drive thru, there's a piece of card board on the speaker that says nothing (very unprofessional.) Sat there a few minutes not knowing what to do. Went to the drive thru and placed order there. Prices were a lot more than the prices listed on line which is what I was prepared to pay.   Between the drive thru speaker and not keeping up on current prices on their website, seems like they just don't care. So for now on I don't care to patron. I'll take my business elsewhere to someplace that shows the customer they care and stay professional. I'm not going to keep patronizing places that doesn't have any sort of professionalism about them. There are tons of restaurants of there!",-1,-1
"WHAT HAPPENED??  A year ago I would recommend anyone visiting Cleveland to come here.  NOT AFTER TODAY!!  I used to LOVE going here!  The Polish boy was one my personal favorites.  Today, I was on my way home and just happened to come by Hot Sauce Williams so I pulled in.  I knew I would have to wait at the drive thru but ...WOW!  15 minutes??  I should have just parked my car and went in.  Drive Thru is a BAD IDEA at this establishment.  I pulled up to the speaker and a piece of cardboard was over the speaker and written in marker saying ""STOP! Order here!"" I ordered and I will come to find out that the prices on their outside menu are WRONG and MORE EXPENSIVE than listed! (I didn't know this but I will explain later). On top of that, it looks like the window covering the menu and prices has not been cleaned since 2012. I ordered the Polish Boy combo and small size fried okra.  I had a couple in front of me and waited approximately 5 minutes before I arrived at the window ( I made a mental note changing radio stations because when I arrived at the window it took longer than the entire song of Baltimora 'Tarzan Boy' as I kept changing stations to pass times and ended back on the 80's channel to hear the end of that song and start a new one).  Do not think of this place as a typical 'fast food' drive thru.  You order and you will WAIT but they don't tell you that which can be a good thing.  This can give you the impression that the food is fresh but to tell you the truth, it didn't seem like it was 'fresh' in least bit.  In fact, it appeared that they took care of of whoever was inside BEFORE the drive thru customers because I actually watched 3 polish boys being made while I waited for my single polish boy because I guess the people inside took priority and they had only ONE person making food with 3 other people handling money and passing out beverages.  While watching someone else's food being prepared another employee came to the window and gave me my ridiculous total of $11.98!!  I gave her my money and at first I just simply thought the tax was high so I asked why my total was $11.98?  Apparently the prices listed on their dusty and dirty outside menu board are WRONG!  The RUDE employee didn't tell me anything.  She just ""handed"" me a receipt.  Instead of the okra being $2.75 it was $3.99!  I told the lady this and she just said, ""It is?  I will have to change that.""  She walked away and I NEVER saw her again. Well, what about you OVERCHARGING??  I was already upset waiting for food so I turned my car off to save gas until I arrived at the window. I was overcharged and the lady avoiding me now, had another employee hand me my beverage. Coke in a can. As I was saying my food was over charged, she closed the window!! WHAT!! This is how you deal with customers with issues!?!? You AVOID them!       Finally I received my food.  They had ANOTHER employee hand me the food and this worker was a male.  I was actually able to talk with him and say that I was overcharged. He was not helpful or even courteous in ANY way! He said, ""I can't help you, I don't work with the menu."" I kept telling him, this was WRONG, you can't overcharge customers and you can't treat people like this! Again, like a robot, ""I can't help you with that.""  I heard enough. ""If you can't fix this or help and NONE of you are willing to help without me making a scene then I'm DONE with ALL of you!"" He replied again, ""I can't help you"" and shut the window then walked away while all the other employees avoided the window.       I'M NEVER RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!! What happened?? The employees don't care! A year ago this was a decent place! They even have photos of Robin Williams (I miss him so much!) visiting there with his family.  What happened? I don't know and I WISH I could give this place more stars but this whole experience was enough for me to give them the LOWEST rating. I had a few good times here in the past with some memorable moments but it will ALWAYS be overlooked by this horrible treatment! THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT AND ATTITUDE! Even the food changed in my opinion. My Polish Boy was a regular sized hot dog with fries and coleslaw slapped on top of it and my fried okra was soggy.  Worst of the all, the sauce was different this time too. It was watered down and tasted old if that's possible. I WILL NOT RETURN.",-1,-1
"I stopped in here today to get a chicken wing dinner for my wife.  After it took this young lady 10 minutes to take my my order.  She tells me its going to be a few minutes on the wings to cook.  So I had time to look around at all the celebrities to visit this staple in Cleveland.  I also had time to see how ran down and dirty this place was.  Dirty tables, floors, and walls.  Ceiling falling apart.  It's obvious they don't put money back into this dilapidated falling building.  30 minutes past I finally get my order.  The older lady gives me my order.  I asked don't I get a drink with my platter.  She told me it doesn't come with a drink.  I know the last time I was here I got the same thing and I got a drink with my food.  Matter fact this time I got coleslaw.  Last time I didn't.   Bottom line I'm all for supporting my community, but if you can't do better I'm taking my money elsewhere. But I'll give you another star because my food was good.",-1,-1
"Lovely mall BUT....Ditto the reviewer from Texas, BEWARE the multiple scam store fronts (in several of the Las Vegas malls) selling ""skincare"" at crazy high prices.   Moderna Tea Shop appears to be a Teavana type store .....however..... I was offered a tea sample at the door (and a tiny bag with a Costco looking teabag in it) but the situation immediately segued into a highly pressured sales pitch for $700 (!) skin care.   Do not let them drag you inside to close the deal. Skip the fast taking BS, politely decline, run if you have to. Stick with Sephora, where you can verify and review what it is that you're buying.",-1,-1
"It is connected to the Grand Canal shops at the Venetian. These shops are all high end and upscale. The only shop I could afford I think was Victoria's Secret. There is an antique bookstore that's interesting to look inside of. There were a lot if vacant spots so I'm not sure how well this place does. Nice to just stroll through. They need to consider putting in some affordable stores too, like the Grand Canal Shoppes.  I was fortunate to have eaten at Mainland when the shops opened. I miss that place. It had yummy noodle dishes. A bowl of noodles was a bowl of luck! ^_^*~",-1,-1
The Shoppes at at The Palazzo needs to monitor at least one of its merchants and that would be Moderna Tea!  Offered a tea sample and then plied with face cream.  The high pressure con man got my husband alone and convinced him to buy $1000. worth of face goop.  After we left the store we read the receipt that said no refunds.  What tea shop sells high end cream?  These guys are con artists and need to be stopped!,-1,-1
"If you're possibly of a darker complexion, casually dressed, and with a group of 10 (including young children), this ""security guard"" will follow you AND ask you what shop you're looking for when looking at the map. Mind you, there were other individuals looking at the map, but this ""security guard"" asked me specifically what store I'm looking for. I told her, I'm looking for a bathroom and proceeds to tell me where the nearest one is then she turns back around t WE WENT AS A FAMILY WITH KIDS.",-1,-1
"I was actually quite disappointed with the Shoppes. Compared to other casino shopping centers like the Forum Shops & the shopping attached to the Venetian next door, the Shoppes really doesn't offer many choices.",-1,-1
"I have to agree with others.  The Shoppes lacks personality.  Comparing this place to the Shoppes at the Venetian is like comparing night and day.  They do have a bunch of high end shops but these stores are often available at places such as the Forum Shops, Bellagio, and Wynn.  Further, the stores here are pretty small (except for Barneys) and their other locations often have more stuff.  It's nice to walk around but if you're looking to make a purchase, head to one of the other casinos and do it there.",-1,-1
I agree with the other reviews. Staff was so unpleasant I only continued to go until my package expired. Will not return.,-1,-1
"Try to cancel a membership here and you quickly find they have a multi-level song-and-dance about why they keep charging your card.  It is rehearsed nonsense about why 3 different layers of management need to get back to you before they can fix an obvious mistake, but none of those people are ever around, or can return your call, or have other contact info, or ... you get the idea.  Do not trust them with your credit card info, and if you have made that mistake, just call your card and have them cancel any bogus charges.  They are familiar with these jokers and will save you the frustration of their runaround.",-1,-1
"I purchased a package of 10 spray-tans through Groupon on December 13, 2011.  I was very excited because I have been to other Hollywood Tans locations in the past and been pleased with the experience.    On my first visit, I attempted to present the Groupon using the Groupon app on my iPhone.  I was rudely told me that the phone screen would not suffice and that I would have to print the coupon and physically present it to them.    I returned the next morning with the printed copy in hand.  The desk attendant took the paper and entered my information into the computer.  She then told me that I would have to pay an additional $4 for the spray tan cartridge.  This additional fee was not disclosed anywhere in the Groupon deal write-up and increased the cost of each tan by 58%.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  I know that Groupon catches a lot of flack for situations like these, but really it is the fault of the individual businesses.  They clearly used deceptive advertising to rope people in on the Groupon deal and surprise them with the additional costs.    Between the snobby, crispy desk attendant I interacted with the first night and the deceptive advertising, this experience has left a seriously bad taste in my mouth.  I have asked Groupon for a refund and I will not be returning to the Shadyside Hollywood Tans.",-1,-1
The waiter was poorly trained and seemed unhappy with his job. Complained that Lebron was a bad tipper. Interrupted our business conversations.  Didnt give me a menu until i asked. We had bought 2 bottles of wine and he did not come back to refill.  Frankly I was a bit embarrassed hosting a business meeting there.  Food was unremarkable as well.,-1,-1
"Food is ok but expensive.  SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.  The hotel tries to do a good job and wants to provide a great experience,  unfortunately,  the restaurant staff have poor attitudes don't really understand what good service means.",-1,-1
"Terrible. Had reservations. Not busy. Hostess was clueless. Left us at restaurant bar and kept seating people with no reservations. Talked to hostess, did not care. Never seated us. Wont be back.",-1,-1
"If you want to eat at a restaurant that strives to exactly satisfy the average palate of the average American diner, this is the place for you. The menu and the wine list will have exactly all the regular, normal choices that the average eater will not be offended by. If you want a memorable meal, go elsewhere.",-1,-1
Slow service and okay food. Only ate here because too cold to walk anywhere. Waiter spent most of the time chatting with another table while I needed service.  Will not eat here again.,-1,-1
"Came here for lunch with two others and did not have a great experience. It was pretty busy upon arrival, however we made a reservation so we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. It was a nice day so we were asked if we'd like outdoor seating, which we agreed to.   Service was extremely poor. We had a reservation for 12:15, we were sat at 12:20 and we did not get our food until 1:20. It took 20 minutes for our server to ask us what we wanted to drink, and another 5-10 minutes for my soda to arrive. We weren't told what the soup of the day was, we weren't told about any specials and we weren't even asked if we'd dined with them before (this place just opened after all). All in all, our server took 30 minutes just to take our order.  25-30 minutes later our food arrived. My friends got the field green salads (which they actually enjoyed, hence the two stars). I ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich, which I did not enjoy at all. The breading on the chicken was bland and tasteless and to be honest, when I cut my chicken open with my knife (this is an open-faced sandwich by the way, something the menu doesn't say) it looked pretty gross in the middle. My fries were simple shoestring fries that tasted fine.  The poor service in combination with the bland tasting food will be the reason I likely will not return. With all the great restaurants available in Cleveland, this one is not worth going to (at least for lunch).",-1,-1
"This was not the best experience. The food was decent and the service was terrible. Waited entirely too long for basic things like drinks and to place our order.. mind you, the place was no where near full. Our waitress could have cared less about anything, and it showed.   Won't be going back ever. Not worth it.",-1,-1
"Food is pretty good for a Hotel. Much better places in downtown, especially for dinner. Service was terrible.  Hilton needs to up service in the restaurant. My wife and I were meeting people in the terrific bar on the 32nd floor. I showed up late an had trouble getting someone so i could order a drink.  Decide to have dinner in the Burnham.  It was 8:30 on a week night. Almost no one in the place. Our server may have also been the bartender.  She paid almost no attention to us.  Bad service can certainly ruin a good meal.",-1,-1
"This was my first visit and I was definitely NOT impressed. The service was quick, but not necessarily competent and the food was overpriced. *On a side note, if you order root beer with your combo, be prepared to receive a 12oz drink instead of the 16oz that supposedly comes with it.",-1,-1
I really was looking forward to a great hot dog and was suprised the retro dog was so tasteless and boring.  I was surprised when I saw the lady sweeping the floor put  the broom down and take the French frie with her bare hands and put my order of fries in the fryer.,-1,-1
"Went for lunch with co-workers. I had the Chicago dog and onion rings with a drink. Dog was excellent, rings not so much. Incredibly greasy - even too much for rings. Unfortunately my co-worker had a disasterous Retro Burger. There was a 9"" or so brown, curly hair found in the MIDDLE of her burger.   We observed a female employee with shoulder-length, brown, curly hair; not tied back or in a hair net, cooking the food. This is gross, unsanitary, and bad restaurant management.  According to www.fda.gov - retail food protection - Chapter 2-402.11: "" (A) Food employees shall wear hair restraints such as hats, hair coverings or nets, beard restraints, and clothing that covers body hair, that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed FOOD; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles.   It was asked that the burger be re-made, and yet again, the same female employee was cooking as before. The practice of employee hygiene is a basic essential of running a restaurant. Shame on the owner for not being aware of day-to-day operations with his/her employee(s).   I will not be going back, nor recommending this establishment.",-1,-1
"Others seem to enjoy the restaurant, so maybe you will enjoy it, but...  My wife's hotdog was warm rather than hot. It was also very small compared to the bun. My cheeseburger was the same way.  The root beer was close, but too sweet for both out tastes.  I think that they spent too much effort on the decor and TVs and not enough on the food.",-1,-1
"1st try we sat in parking lot with lights on for 15 minutes.  No service, no one even looked our way.  The only people waited on were the ones under the canopy.  No signs anywhere that they only have service under awning.  Swenson's services their whole lot!  2nd visit I got a spot under the canopy.  Waitress came to car and wanted me to order.  No menu boards, no menu, I ordered 2 dogs and Onion Rings.  Ordered 1 all beef and 1 natural with the same topping and an order of onion rings to go.  Both dogs barely warm and 1 had the correct toppings, the other one had I don't know what on it, some sort of hot relish maybe?  Onions rings were the greasiest I've ever had!  Great concept that failed to deliver!!",-1,-1
"I was the only car at curbside, yet it took 5 minutes for someone to bring me a menu.  I paid $22 plus for a cheeseburger, veggie dog, two orders of fries (which were very small) and 2 shakes.  The cheeseburger was not edible.  It was fatty and there was so much salt on it that I had to throw it out.  While good, the fries were in a really small cup.  I could pay the same price and get a large overflowing cup at Five Guys.  The only good thing from the whole experience was the free trade coffee shake.  Won't be back for the food.",-1,-1
This place was gross! The best thing on the hot dog was the mustard I had Conney sauce and Cole slaw and they were no good. And on top of it the Server that came to the car was rude. They didn't say hello...how are you...nothing! They just handed a menu thru the window and said turn on your lights when you're ready to order. Then when we were done they never said how was everything...nothing! Even tho they seen my brothers hot dog only had one bite missing from it because it was so nasty! For a $4 dog and service like that this place doesn't even deserve a 1/4 of a star!!,-1,-1
"Heard this place was terrible from a family friend & wish I would've taken his opinion to heart. My fiance & I were scouting Retro Dog out for possibly having their food truck for our wedding reception but they instantly failed.   I am a french fries queen! I can tell you who has the best fresh cut, frozen, sweet potato, etc fries around and Retro Dog is not one of them. They claim to be fresh cut but they tasted a little frozen. My fries were not raw but were definitely not cooked long enough (no crisp, just limp d*ck). Sadly, bathing them in a small cup of salt & malt vinegar didn't save the day.   Then my fiance ordered their Chicago & White dog but said they weren't very good & he could've made better at home. He also ordered their tempura onion rings- F**king disgusting!!!! The onions inside were cut way too thick & therefore weren't cooked all the way.  The batter tasted like idk what- a really bad knock off of Arby's curly fries &, again, was undercooked & greasy. Even if I had just gotten off of a crappy 12 hour shift at work with no break and an hour long drive home I wouldn't eat their food. Less than 15 minutes later I got heart burn so...   As for their service- not bad, but their Root beer float was the only good thing that I had. But i must admit, I love the concept & the decor- just not the food!",-1,-1
Soooooo disappointed.  As others had mentioned the onion rings are horrible...just rings of grease. The actual hot dog and burger were tasty...but bread and stuff not so much. I've had better root beer...odd after taste. We gave you a try...there is potential.,-1,-1
(6-18-12) My daughter had a Noon appointment not far away - pulled in at 11:05am figuring a hot dog joint should be able to get us in and out within 30 minutes. Boy was i wrong I had to FLAG DOWN a server @ 11:40 just to take back the menu since i knew we wouldn't have time to order and eat. I sat there with my lights on from 11:20 until 11:40 waiting for someone to take my order. Several servers looked like they were afraid to talk to people as they run back and forth looking at the ground. At one point i counted 6 cars under the canopy with lights on and no one around. One employee stood in the front of the building (apparently on break) just looking at all the cars with lights on. MANAGER NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I will try again as they are new and hopefully everyone will be better trained.,-1,-1
"I recently dined here and was very disappointed. I have dined at many different hot dog establishments and this one was overpriced in my opinion. The fries were over seasoned, making them very salty and inedible. I enjoyed the snap of the hot dog, but didn't find it to be a hot dog I would throughly enjoy eating again. I also had a float, it was ok but I feel it was overpriced. 2 fries, 1 hot dog, 1 foot long and 2 floats equated to almost $30. Sorry to say, I won't be coming back.",-1,-1
"The Red Hot was very soggy. My bun fell apart. The Chicago Dog has good flavor, but the wiener was nothing to write home about. Overpriced and flies all over.",-1,-1
"Great service, OK food.  It seemed like everything was just a little off.  I had the Retro Dog and onion rings and the hubs got the Carolina Dog with fries.  The hot dog itself was really good... Mellow taste, nice snap... but the coney sauce was a turn off.  Very sweet, not much spice.  My husband said his Carolina dog was good, but he said he would try something else next time.  The onion rings really had me excited because they looked perfect... they weren't.  The spices in the tempura overwhelmed any onion flavor that might have been there and they were SO GREASY!  I ate one and a half rings and had to stop.  The fries were just OK too and needed to have salt added to them.  They had a really nice natural potato flavor but they tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while, which seems implausible considering how busy they were.  We also ordered the root beer and the flavor was not unpleasant, but it was very flat.  Considering how very sweet it is, it could have used more carbonation.    I would like to return to Retro Dog and try a dog with just mustard.  Of course, we also need to try the custard!",-1,-1
Cool LOOKING place but about $25 for 2 chili dogs 2 fries and some sodas was WAYYYYY TOOO MUCH MONEY and while it was a cool looking place....I would NOT go back only because of the sky high prices.,-1,-1

"It's an unusually warm day, almost 60 degrees, and I thought you need to go eat at a drive-in and take in the balmy day. I've been to Retro Dog once, not long after it opened, and I wasn't impressed but I thought give it another shot. This was going to be a 3-star review until after I finished eating, turned on my lights, waited 15 minutes, then had to CALL them to come out and take my money. The young man really was giving good curb service until the end. He was very apologetic, but come on, he saw my lights on as did another young man. They took care of 3 other cars and ignored me. Anyway, as to the food, it was just ok and pricey for the quality, $10.55 for a bacon cheeseburger, small fries, and small Coke. Nothing I couldn't have made at home better. No next time for Retro Dog.",-1,-1
"I am a vegetarian. The veggie dog was not that good. It tasted a bit...old or dry maybe. The veggie chili was also a bit dry and very salty. There were lentils in it, but there just wasn't enough moisture to make it that enjoyable or enough cheese to save it.",-1,-1
"Huge disappointment. Great concept, great atmosphere. However, food was less than. Hot dog and fries were overcooked to the point of being burnt. The onion rings were the only good part of our meal. It was sad as our expectations were high.",-1,-1
"The beef hot dog tasted like a regular pork hot dog. No""snap"". Very disappointing. The fries were good. I won't be back.",-1,-1
"Save your money. Onion rings were dripping in grease! Hamburger had no flavor. My third time here it's good in theory, just not in execution.",-1,-1
"We were here on a weekday afternoon.  I had a white hot dog and my companions had Chicago dogs.  Mine was acceptable.  Their hot dogs were not great.  If you strip away the bun and the toppings, the hot dogs should be amazing.  They were very flat.  There is a huge difference between cheap hot dogs and flavorful hot dogs and these were generic at best.  The hand cut fries were decent but not amazing.  The onion rings were awful, full of grease, and well done.  The dip for the onion rings would be better if it was a full flavor mustard.  The service was quick.  The prices and portions were acceptable until we ate the food.  We were seriously disappointed.",-1,-1
"Harold and Kumar traveled how far for these dumb burgers...  Totally not worth the hype. My ex stoner roommate was obsessed with White Castle and used to buy the frozen ones.. So when I tried these for the 1st time I couldn't believe how it tastes exactly the same (yuk)  People were buying them by the case when we walked in, total disappointment. People in the east coast got it all wrong these soggy sliders are crappy. Another reason the west coast rules.",-1,-1
"Need to be a teenager, drunk, or stoned. It took 15 minutes for a single to go original slider. Greasy, heavy on sautÃ©ed onion, very thin patty with very little texture... I'll take a McDonald's hamburger any day. Looked better in the movies.",-1,-1
This is seriously overrated!! They are really just burgers mini sized. My fiance scarfed down 4 mini burgers. Their fries were gross. It was not salted. I ordered their chicken rings and it was really just chicken nuggets in a different shape. AND it's expensive!,-1,-1
"Set your expectations really low when coming here and you might not hate yourself too much for spending your well earned dollars here.    There was nothing memorable about having them.  We came here for the novelty of trying it out just once for the sake of Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle.  I'll give it an extra star because I think these things would make great drunken munchie meals, but then again, so would everything else.",-1,-1
"Ok so I'm not from the east coast so I've tried many burgers in Vegas and I was pretty disappointed with these.   Food:  Cheese sliders- 2/5 I ordered the cheese sliders. The burgers were small and pricey. I didn't like the smell of them and I didn't like how it tasted like a burger from any other franchised restaurant. Nothing stood out for me.   Chicken rings- 1/5 Seriously don't get these. They are crispy but flavorless and super thin. Honestly thought McDonalds chicken nuggets were better.   French fries- 2/5 Fries were a bit soggy. But these were my favorite out of all the stuff I ordered.   Service is GOOD! 4/5: Expect a long wait. I waited in line for more than an hour but I got my food in less than 5 mins! They are friendly and efficient!! They try to make the wait bearable by talking to you, which I thought was neat.   Overall if your a person who likes a burger with flavor and who has ate many flavorful burgers, White Castle isn't for you. I was quite disappointed but many other people love the simplicity of their food. This joint just wasn't for me.",-1,-1
"I really don't get the whole hype about this place. I mean it's a bit different in the way they serve their burgers but I felt I couldn't really enjoy it entirely because they serve them in bite-size pattys.   I was hoping it would of felt like a meal but honestly it felt like a mid-day snack before lunch. Fries are good but I don't think I will be coming back to try it again. Unless someone can convince me that there is a must try item on their menu. I'll stick to regular in n out. Service here was horrible. The one thing that did bug me was when our order was called. My friend was already heading to pick it up and the lady begins to speak on the Mic. ""Number ???, you will find your number if you have  looked in your receipt on the bottom part of it.""  And I mean she said it with an attitude as if we didn't know it was there. So unnecessary and uncalled for.",-1,-1
"This place is literally the worst place I have ever been. (Service-wise). The food is relatively standard-ware. I came and waited in line with 3 of my friends on an afternoon, and waited about 20 minutes in line to place my order. I understand that places get busy, so it was acceptable.  However, after about 30 minutes of waiting for our orders, my friends all got their orders, but I still had not yet received mine. I inquired several times about my order, and where it was in the queue. My friends finished eating, and we kept waiting around.  Each time I asked, the person handing out the food would promptly dismiss me, and even the manager bluntly and rudely told me they serve hundreds of burgers a day, and it would come out soon enough.   Also note - my order number was 374, but they kept on calling order 274 out. I asked if they perhaps had my order ready, but they told me no, they had Order 274 ready, and that it was not my order.  Now, about 1.5 hours after entering the restaurant, and an hour after placing my order, I demanded that they finally look inside the bag, and the manager who had been extremely rude finally conceded that they had mislabeled my order.  Instead of offering anything to help make it better, they only offered me a brownie, which means that they valued wasting about an extra hour of my time at ~2 dollars.  If they had merely checked the queue the first time I asked, no problems would have occurred, and we could have resolved all the issues. Instead, this Whitecastle decides to run as if the customer is always wrong, and will stonewall and lie to you about your order.  Once a mistake is also made, they will make a measly effort to fix their problems.  I strongly recommend you go elsewhere for a burger fix in Vegas.",-1,-1
"white castle is a horrible  place to work! my son n law worked his first shift and was locked in a freezer multiple  times,made fun of because Edward and Francisco didn't  like his name,they refused to teach to teach him his job even though they were suppose  to train him, and he didn't  get a lunch or breaks until the two boys got off shift and an actual manager was working and gave him a lunch break his last he of work! I will most definitely  be contacting an attorney! go back to the east coast white castle we don't  need companies  like yours here if your going to treat people poorly! remember  bullying  is not tolerated!",-1,-1
"So, I came here the last week I was living in Vegas hoping that it would be as amazing as Harold and Kumar show in their movie about how amazing White Castle is.  I literally went on a journey from Reno to Las Vegas, then finally got to White Castle with high hopes. Yea there was a long line (its Vegas, there are long lines everywhere and long wait times in Vegas on the strip). We got our food quickly, but oh my gawd it was disgusting.  I am so disappointed that the burgers were watery, like they were frozen and not cooked all the way. The sliders filled me up quickly, but it was not satisfying. Definitely really expensive and not worth the price.  Dont expect to have that amazing experience there, unless you are super drunk or high and dont care what you put in your mouth. Fries were ok.",-1,-1
"There is nothing special about this place. Read the Yelp Reviews and trust them! Do not come here! Harold and Kumar promoted this place like no other so everyone had to come try them, I was one of those people.  The sliders are worse than the ones sold in the frozen foods section. It is small and will fit into the size of your palm. The bread was slightly warm and soggy. The patty was dry. The small pickle was lying naked alongside small speckles of onions. It was not tasty at all. I had to squeeze a full bag of ketchup on it to give it life. For a dollar something each, I would rather walk myself to a McDonalds and order something off the dollar menu.  My boyfriend and I decided to come here because it was 5am and he was starving. Shake Shack and Rasising Canes were both closed so White Castle it was. The next morning, my boyfriend and I woke up with bad tummyaches. Luckily, our hotel had two bathrooms....",-1,-1
"No. It's over rated because of its reputation but the food is not good. A single slider was 2.50 and that's as much as a burger at in-n-out. This is a ""only choice"" type of eat. Don't eat here if you have other options. Not to mention it's the only one in Vegas and for locals the parking and ordering and dealing with all those tourists is too ridiculous.",-1,-1
"I expected better from here. The sliders weren't that tasty and became a chore to eat after a while. The chicken rings tasted like frozen dino nuggets (not even as good as Dino nuggets). I also had the vanilla milkshake, which was pretty good. It tasted like an In N Out shake, but sweeter. The fries weren't that bad either, I would eat them again. Lastly, the onion chips were probably the best out of the whole meal; they were really crispy and delicious.   Overall, I wouldn't come back here by choice but it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience. Their staff was friendly and service was quick, impressive since it's pretty full..being on the strip and all. All and all, i say come and try it out for yourself. It just didn't meet my expectations.",-1,-1
"I went there yesterday line was long, that wasn't the problem. The problem was there was no communication or organization. They were selling milkshakes and didn't even have them ready me and several other people had to wait a little too long for the rude manager. The lady screaming out the orders was very unorganized and rude. They need a better way of putting the food out when it's ready. And the worst part was when I get home I find out that one of the bags was burnt, it was like somebody left it next to a warmer and was like oops let me just put the bag where they can't see it. Really? You are gonna sell burnt burgers and bags?  The only positive thing was I did get my 30 burgers quickly and before other people, even though it was BURNT!! Seriously I never had so many problems in one place.",-1,-1
"OMFG.... I had low expectations for this place AND it still managed to underwhelm me. I've never had White Castle being from NorCal there isn't any close by. Ordered the #1 combo: 4 sliders, fries, drink. I couldn't even finish all the sliders... didn't want to ruin my appetite for a redemption dinner.   If you never had White Castle, don't worry you're not missing out on anything. Not even worth a try!",-1,-1
"If I could give White Castle a negative star I would. I can't believe this place exists. We had a gift card and wanted to try it out. We ordered 40 mini sliders, fries and onion rings. The meat didn't even look or taste like meat, it was horrible. Everything was soggy and not eatable it felt like I was eating something foreign. The best part about the meal was the Powerade. Very upsetting.",-1,-1
I'm so glad we don't have these in Niagara Falls. These were the greasiest blandest fast food burgers iv'e ever had and they weren't cheap for what you got.,-1,-1
"This place shouldn't receive any stars. My husband and I were looking forward to their great food. When we finally had a chance to go, the service was horrible and the food was worse than hospital food. The burgers meat were tasteless and the fries were soggy. Their soda machine had post-its on every other drink being out of order. Plus, we both ended up getting a stomach ache and the runs that night.",-1,-1
Soooo disappointed! Harold and Kumar don't know what a good burger tastes like... sliders tasted like it was microwaved I threw it away I couldn't take another bite. Just thinking about those nasty onions makes my stomach turn ... BLAH!,-1,-1
"Right next to Harrah's along the strip.  Sure, you don't have to go to the East Coast for this. On the other hand, you're better off getting something else.  The sliders were alright. Ended up getting the 20-pack with two fries. Add cheese to them and it's a little extra. Also ordered some mozzarella sticks. Total came to just under $40. If you buy the slider packs, it would be cheaper than buying 2 or 3 meals that come with maybe 3 sliders and a drink and fries. Up to you what you wanna do.  It's good to try. But I'm probably going to skip this and find another 24-hour place for something quick.",-1,-1
"We came Sunday 5/28/17 at 4:30 pm on our way home. The fries were the best part of the meal but let me tell you, nothing special about the burgers. We have had White Castle in New York and my husband was excited to try it here in Vegas.   We BOTH left (my husband and I) with FOOD POISONING and we BOTH ended up in urgent care on Memorial Day and still too sick to return to work today! Right now is my second attempt to eat since eating there Sunday.   I will NEVER eat there again! I have been burping up those nasty onions for two days! Ughhh!   I will stick to the regular White Castle on the east coast. Lesson learned.....",-1,-1
"Nahhh dude, you must be outta your mind because this was not worth the west coast adventure...",-1,-1
Terrible food. Chicken sandwich was just a piece of fried chicken between two buns. Absolutely nothing else on it. Double burger was better but still unsatisfying. Garbage,-1,-1
Go to the Mcdonald's just a few minutes away if you want a cheeseburger.  The sliders were pretty gross but the mozzarella sticks and fries were great. This place is overhyped for the taste and quality.,-1,-1
"Many years ago, I visited a White Castle back east (once) so I knew what to expect, but we decided to give this place a try just because it's new to Vegas.  Before I get to the food, I have to mention that the two cashiers were both visibly annoyed at the customers in front of us, and they treated the couple two spots ahead of us in a completely unacceptable manner, simply because they were new to the menu and unsure how to order, making an annoyed face and screaming ""NEXT"" to get to the customer behind them. I was sure to place my order as quickly as possible (we ordered the #2 cheeseburger, fries, and drink), so at least the cashier appeared to merely tolerate me as I paid. This place has only been open a few weeks and the employees at the front are already burnt out. What's up with that? With so much unemployment in Vegas, couldn't they have found a few cashiers who are a bit friendlier?  As for the food - well, it's White Castle. It is what it is. Tiny, thin burger in a plain bun, with a bit of cheese and onion. There's a burger in there, but can anyone really taste it? I estimate the ratio of bun to burger is about 8:1, so you'll have to eat a huge amount of bun before you get much burger in your tummy! The fries were just bleh.  About the location - I'm not sure where to park to get into this place. There is no parking in front, so we ended up parking in the Venetian and walking back to the Strip, but surely there's a spot closer than that? Also, there were TWO security guards working this location, which only amplified the negative vibes in this place. And our table was damaged enough that it made eating uncomfortable - such a shame at such a new location.  Not recommended.",-1,-1
"This is not much of a burger. The meat, if you can find it is so small, you can't taste it. Although I pulled it out and tried just the meat. It was flavorless. The buns are wet. Not moist...WET. Even though you watch them cook the burger, it presents like a frozen, microwaved something you by in the frozen section at the supermarket.  Fries? Yes, they have fries. Again it's like they microwave them. That's just how it is presented. The fries, crinkle cut, are barely cooked, soggy, and served Luke warm.  I know this place is popular on the east coast, but from what I can tell, I am not sure why.",-1,-1
"I only expected better because we have these in St. Louis.  It took them forever to get our order prepared and then it was wrong...so disappointing.  once they got it right it was good.  However, the wait was way too long and I wanted it right the first time.",-1,-1
I was in live for an hour last night when finally got to cashier to make my order I got 2 regular no onion and no cheese and  10 jalapeÃ±o no cheese- none where jalapeÃ±o and all cheese - all burgers ended up in the trash - 1 AM you know I was hungry ! Lost my appetite when saw wrong order -I try to call the vegas number and no way to be transfer to manager no one picks up. Left 5 messages no one bother to call back !!  No excuse to take bad order !!  Hire none experienced young kids to work !  Bad bad and bad !,-1,-1
"I seriously don't understand the hype.  I went on an adventure to just to get here, and I was fairly disappointed. The line wrapped around and almost reached the dining tables. The wait just to order took about 30 minutes, and the wait for the food was about an additional 20.  I ordered a bunch of cheese sliders and original sliders to bring back to the hotel for my group of friends. Needless to say, my first White Castle slider will probably be my last White Castle slider. There was nothing special about it, and I definitely was not impressed. The patty was incredibly thin and I don't remember it tasting much like anything.  I will consider trying the one on the east coast, but I will not be returning to this location.",-1,-1
"If not for the movie, I would have never tried this. I regret it. White castle is straight disgusting. Its expensive for what it is too. Don't waste your time... McDonald's is head and shoulders better. Hell, so is Burger King and that's saying a lot!",-1,-1
"I think this might be the unhappiest place on earth. It never seems to have what I need, has bad prices and the staff seem miserable.",-1,-1
"This is my local grocery store, and it is arguably the worst grocery store in Toronto. Why?  - Understocked: Half the time I go in there, they don't have standard items like 2L 1% milk or cottage cheese.  - Expired goods: When they do have what I want most of the time the expiry date is 1 week away. It's very rare I get what I want with a reasonable expiry date.  - Highly overpriced: Everything from soda to toilet paper is way more expensive than even Metro or Loblaws.  I used to be a huge opponent of Loblaws opening a store near Kensington, but with this being our only option, coupled with the fact that 90% of the stores in the market are only open until 7-8 (and even earlier in the winter), the people in this area sorely need a reasonable grocery store open.  If you happen to be unemployed, Kensington would be a great place to shop. But for people who work until 5-6 and then have an activity after such as going to the gym, shopping in Kensington is an impossibility. It's extremely frustrating.",-1,-1
"Sketchy looking place at a first glance and it is indeed sketchy. I have had money stolen from a cashier (Kalsi, a middle-aged woman with brown skin and is roughly 5' 5"".) working at Zimmerman's twice in the past year. The first time, I let it slide. The second time, I contacted management (Martin Zimmerman) and he simply ignored me.  Just so that others do not get scammed the same way I do, I will describe how I had money stolen. I gave her a $20 and after she put the bill in the cash register, she claimed I only gave her $10. When I insisted otherwise, she got hostile and accused me of trying to take money. What she will tell you is that the manager will count the money and if there is surplus, she will contact you. An obvious workaround for her is to pocket $10 before the manager counts.  If you are paying with cash, I suggest you have the cashier identify the cash amount you are giving her. Have her verbally affirm that she sees the amount you are giving and better yet, record it with video.",-1,-1
"This store hasn't changed in years!  It's still the depressing and overpriced store that I remembered from my earlier years, but I stopped in to take a browse since it has been a long time that I visited.  No wonder it has been a long time!  The interior is a decent size with spacious aisles and some-what stocked shelves, but selection of brands is limited. The way the shelves are setup so far apart, makes the store seems a little bigger, definitely lots of room in the aisles.  Location is convenient if you live in the neighbourhood to get some staples in the market that other stores doesn't offer. If you don't have time to go to one of the bigger grocery stores and don't  mind paying the higher prices for convenience, then this store is for you.  I'm really surprised that Zimmerman's has survived.   I wonder for how much longer?",-1,-1
"I am laughing so hard right now after reading the Edie review where she mentions the staff are ""disabled"", I, personally, hadn't noticed, but I'll look more carefully next time, maybe that cute blond that just started working there has a hidden peg leg.... I think not.    The only thing I really buy here on a regular basis is milk.  Most other things you would need such as toiletries and cleaning supplies you are much better off buying in bulk at a wallmart, if that notion doesn't offend you, and buying your meat and veggies at smaller stores in kensington market.",-1,-1
"2 stars for the Andy Warhol exhibit's value in my eyes.  $13 for locals, and it took us about 10-15min to walk through the entire place, taking a little time to check out each piece of art and reading the commentary.  Can't say this was my style of art, but if it was a different artist or set, I could probably push the venue up to a 3-4 star review.  But since it's not, I have to go with the value in my eyes, which was pretty low.   I came here for the company anyways!  LOL",-1,-1
"I went to art school so of course, I love art.  I've been to many museums such as SF MOMA, NY MOMA, LACMA, MOCA, Chicago Art Institute, Musee D' Orsay, Louvre and more.  I've been to BGFA in Bellagio a few times when they had Gaugin, Picasso and the latest, Andy Warhol.  We got there at 7:30pm and they were closing at 8pm.  We were told we only had 30 minutes - yeah, I figured that much.  I also knew we would only need less than 30 minutes.  This is a teeny tiny gallery so even if I stared at every single piece of art and read the notes about each piece, I wouldn't need 30 minutes! For $13 per local, this place isn't worth it - you're not getting your money's worth at all.  You can see more art in other galleries in other cities for $15.  We were done in 15-20 minutes.  They also don't allow photography. I've taken pictures of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre without a problem...yup, MONA LISA...LOUVRE! Something's not right. The gallery feels so stuffy and humid...might not be the best environment to keep art in.  However, the lack of culture and art in this city, I feel obliged to like this gallery since I have no choice.",-1,-1
"I love museums and I have been wanting to go to this gallery for quite awhile. I finally got the opportunity to go on Saturday and I was kind of disappointed at the quantity of art for the price, which is $12 for locals and $15 for tourists. There were pieces on display from artists such as Clemente (one of my favorites),Lichtenstein, Degas, Renoir, and a few from Picasso among others. In the admission price you get an audio reader of sorts to further describe certain pieces of art but the room was literally the size of a 3 bedroom apartment. It's your basic small gallery with wood floors and white walls.  In comparison to museums like the Whitney, MoMa, and Guggenheim the prices are comparable but not the quantity. Of course the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art could never compete in the sizes of those museums, but the prices should reflect the quality and quantity of artwork. I feel like this was the Bellagio's attempt to add to it's ambiance of  refinement by adding this gallery which ended up just feeling like a cheap novelty of a museum. I'd rather go to the Guggenheim next time i'm in New York and get more bang for my buck. But hey, i'm a thrifty girl who usually pays $5 on suggested admission prices so take from that what you will :)",-1,-1
"Love art in all forms.. The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art currently has 43 pieces from Pablo Picasso till January 10, 2016. I was expecting more than a Picasso collection but that pretty much it. Two rooms storing a number of his paintings for $19. Definitely not worth it. I could of seen this or researched his paintings online.   A definite must skip. Enjoy the gelato place next door.",-1,-1
"I have visited this museum 3 or 4 times over the last couple of years. Fortunately, my husband can occasionally get us in for free so that's when we go. Like this past weekend, for example.   The current exhibit, which runs through January 2012, is ""A Sense of Place."" But the sense I got was that they just threw some paintings together to try to fit a theme. I'm sure if you are an art major you would totally disagree with me; but for the general public, the art seems to be chaotically set up.   It starts off with paintings from the mid- to late-1800's and they fit the theme: a painting of Venice, a painting of a French countryside. Next thing you know, you are looking at a sketch from Christo and Jean-Claude (who did The Gates in Central Park a few years ago) from the 1960's. It was quite a jump in the evolution of art. Well no matter, I figured, since the next dozen paintings were from the late 1900's and still (mostly) fit the theme. Walked into the next room and what do you know? A painting by Monet and a photo of a golf course from a couple years ago. Like I said, it seemed chaotically set up.   The last room was probably the worst; not in terms of the art itself, but just the fact that it didn't really seem to fit the theme or a logical order. There was a sculpture of a cloud....which I *guess* you can say is a ""Sense of Place"" and then a pop art piece by Lichtenstein and then some other stuff I've (sadly) already forgot.   I really really really want this town to have a decent for-reals museum like other cities. One where you feel like a $15 entry is worth the price. And I really don't want to be so harsh on this place since we need some culture in this town and this is one of the few places to get it. Again, the paintings themselves are great to look at....they just seem to be haphazardly thrown together so you are left scratching your head.   A few years ago, we saw the Ansel Adams exhibit at Bellagio and I would have probably given that 4-stars. It was very memorable and I learned a lot from it. This exhibit however... I don't think it justifies the price tag. Maybe if there was a more logical order to the pieces and if the audio guides had more detail I could have bumped it up to 3 stars. But for now I will say, don't bother (unless you are seriously in love with art)... and let's wait til January to see what the next exhibit will be.",-1,-1
"Very disappointed! I was expecting more for the price.   The museum is EXTREMELY small for the $20 ticket per person. It is only two rooms. Very, very small. Very disappointed.   If you are not interested in the artist, then don't bother coming. They change themes every 6 months or so; just like other museums, but this one is extremely small. Not much variety... I mean, there is no room for variety I guess.",-1,-1
"I have been there. I believe more than once.  I was not in awe by this gallery. It was Ok. I thought it would be bigger and have more art, and flair. I guess not. I am glad it exists, I guess its good to have a touch of historical fine art in a casino, since the city of Las Vegas has very few fine art museums.",-1,-1
"Families are not welcome in this gallery - strollers are not permitted and they will not store them for you.  Not worth the money, and if you read their website they don't even guarantee to be open during their publicized hours.  Don't even bother going here!",-1,-1
Went to the Warhol exhibit.  Save your money and buy the coffee table book.  For the price they are charging you should be able to get in to a real museum.,-1,-1
"Disappointing. While the Warhol exhibit is interesting, it is an extremely small display for the price. We'd heard about the Gallery for many years, and it didn't live up to the hype.   I'd recommend the Mob Exhibit at the Tropicana; much better value and highly recommended.",-1,-1
"My husband and I were not big fans of this gallery.  We both walked out and said, ""That was it?""  We were expecting a lot more.  We went there with high hopes for the American Modernism exhibit.  Actually, we were really looking forward to it.  See, my husband is an art professor at The University of Texas, so art is a big part of our lives, and we were really looking forward to the artists they advertised as included.  The price was super expensive to enter.  I paid less when I went to the Prado.  This was no Prado, believe me.  It consisted of two rooms and one video room where they were showing a relatively cool video on Georgia O'Keeffe.  But other than that, I'd skip it.  I felt like we paid $17 to watch a 20 minute video.",-1,-1
I apparently am not enough of an art lover to appreciate the enigmatic sparseness of this one room display on the human form....translation: ummm..where is the rest of the art in this place?Gift shop is as big as the gallery.   It is a nice reprieve from the Blackjack table. So for that they get two.,-1,-1
Not worth the 15$ admission. I've been to galleries around the world and have a minor in art history and the Lichtenstien Warhol and friends show was the smallest collection of minor works I've ever been charged for. We were very disappointed.,-1,-1
"Skip this.  I visited Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts while they were having the Mohammed Ali collection.  1. I was scammed out of an extra ticket cost.  I have a Buy One Get One Free pass, but was charged me for two tickets anyways.  Upon bringing this up, she wrote ""Returned 1"" on my receipt and said I'll be refunded.  I had to call them later to get the refund.  2. The cost of entrance is $16 for hotel guests or AAA members.  $18 otherwise  3. Use myVegas app 4000 credits to get a buy one get one free  4. The art gallery is 2 big rooms and even if you spend time looking and reading everything, you should be out in roughly 40 minutes.  5. When I went, they had a Mohammed Ali collection.  Autographed items and replicas of things he used.  It's cool, but it's not fine art.  Maybe I'm just the type of guy that doesn't appreciate art, but it was NOT worth $18.  Even at half the price, $9 is not worth it.",-1,-1
"This was my first visit to the Bellagio Fine art gallery. I heard they were showing some of Pablo Picasso's work. I was excited because I was looking for inspiration for my personal fine art photography projects. It cost $16 for locals and they offered free audio headphones (I declined the headphones). It took me all of 10 minutes to walk through the gallery! I felt very disappointed and cheated with the small amount of work they had on display. Even the Cosmopolitan hotel had more art to see inside of their hotel... And it was FREE! Not that money is a factor, but for $16 there were too many empty wall space in the gallery. It was still pretty cool to see a few of Picasso's paintings. Not many can say that... But I doubt I'd go back.",-1,-1
$15 general admission to a small gallery.  Select few good pieces but not really worth the price.,-1,-1
"On 9/20/17 we experienced the Bellagio Art Exhibit of Muhammad Ali.Â  The public cost was $18 per adult and children 12 and under were free.Â  We used the Las Vegas Power Pass, so this attraction was included.Â    The exhibit included 2 smaller rooms displaying some pictures and stories about Ali.Â  You can also receive a device which tells you stories while you progress through the exhibit.Â  In addition to the pictures, there were a few displays containing artifacts of Ali.Â  Most of which were reproductions.Â    It took about 15 minutes to go through the exhibit, but we stopped listening to the recordings pretty quickly and just read the information and looked at the artifacts.Â    Unless you are a die hard Ali fan who wpuld like to see reproductions and have some cash you want to waste, I would recommend skipping this exhibit and look at the photos I provided, they pretty much show what you would see.Â    However, if your in the area and have the Power Pass or received free admission, then go for it.",-1,-1
"Everyone knows that when it comes to all things Las Vegas, it ain't cheap. I can't find a single better example than the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art. Yes, it might be fine, but there's no reason to pay a hefty fine to see some 25 or 30 pieces of art. It costs $15 for non locals and $10 for students. Yes, they do have works from Picasso and that fact alone saved this review from being demoted to a single star.   Save your money and go to the Richard MacDonald gallery of art based on his sculptures of Cirque du Soliel. Ironically, there are more works here and they are insanely detailed and quite amazing.   Oh, and this gallery is also free.",-1,-1
"Skip this.  They just have two rooms worth of exhibits. About the size of two living rooms. So when you pay about $18, you would think they would put at least the best art in these two room, but not so at the BGFA.  For example, I came here for the Picasso Creatures and Creativity. They had way better art at the Picasso Restaurant then at the BGFA. At least I had a fine dinner and got to experience several paintings rather than random sketches at the BGFA.  No matter how much I tried to stay as long as I could to get my monies worth, I spent only about 15 minutes at the BGFA. And that was a stretch.",-1,-1
Don't waste your money.  They hype it up to be something large and worth seeing but it's not.  The exhibits were small and not worth the high admission fee.  I even used my student discount and still thought it wasn't worth it.,-1,-1
"Warhol was unconventional, his art was pop, accessible over the top, warm, happy .... The Bellagio exhibit is cold, sterile, lofty... the exact opposite of Andy's philosophies. I think he would vomit. A major disappointment. Warhol's art is amazing and powerful... but the Bellagio exhibit is disjointed and odd.   We just returned from the Andy Wahol: 'Warhol Out West' exhibition to open at Bellagio.",-1,-1
"I use to come here a lot, every Wednesday if 50% off for locals! The only problem is that this place looks in art... I know this is not LA or NY, I'm not asking for a real art gallery, but this is Bellagio!!! I'm expecting way more, or make it free ! Andy Warhol collection was disappointing, with only few of his work pieces...",-1,-1
Me personally I didn't like it all it taste weird to me and it smelled like a dead animal n my opinion I will not return to any because it's just not for my taste buds the staff was friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and suggestive selling... The lines can be long but that's expected need more setting...it was pretty clean   Overall I rated it 2 stars because of staff....,-1,-1
"This iconic bigger chain popularized mini slider burgers.  I found them fairly tasteless, skimpy, and unsatisfying.  Going in I had very low expectations of the burgers but even then I was not satisfied with the product.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I will definitely not be going back.",-1,-1
"WHITE CASTLE --- Not worth the wait--  I was so excited to have a white castle open in LV like so many east coasters and went today. What a disappointment!! First timers are going to wonder what all the fuss is about . The burgers were lacking flavor, not hot and you had to look for the onions - and as we all know that gives this little (but expensive) burger the flavor and steam needed to make that bun so special. Neither were there. The bun top actually made it a bit dry since there was NO ketchup and cold! As a local, I will buy the frozen ones and not make the trip to the strip for this $1.29 miss . At least when heated they possess the flavor we remember even adding your own ketchup and pickle",-1,-1
"Overpriced and halfassed  I am a NJ native and have had white castle for over 15 years.  This place is like a cheap imitation while charging almost double for it.    First issue is the fact they don't add ketchup like they do at all white castles.  I had to tear all of my burgers apart to add ketchup which being sliders was cumbersome.  Even the guy I complained to who is from NJ said "" we don't do that, even though all of the other ones do it"".  Second issue was the quality.  The burgers weren't fully cooked, since the patties are so thin, this is very hard to screw up.  Third issue was the fries.  They were much thinner and far less quantity than the normal white castles.  Fourth issue was the very loud intercom, they yell almost every 15 seconds your order numbers.  This interrupts the dining experience and hurt my ears.  If you want the real white castle experience I highly suggest you skip this horrible excuse for a white castle and go to an established one.",-1,-1
"So we were vacationing in Vegas and got super excited when we saw a White Castle on the strip, living in the West Coast we've never tried it and heard how amazing these burgers are so we wanted to see what the whole fuzz was about.  Oh man we expected too much those burgers were so gross it tasted like something you can feed to a dog, after the first bite I wanted to puke.  It even got us sick ugh I seriously don't think it's real meat I don't know the quality was horrible. McDonald burgers even taste better,  better yet stick to In N Out , best burgers ever and taste fresh unlike here , NEVER AGAIN , SAVE YOUR MONEY PLZ",-1,-1
"White Castle was in Las Vegas as a food truck during the Las Vegas Foodie Fest previous years and the line for it was un-fricken-believable. Reportedly, people waited long hours for the infamous tiny sliders. I didn't wait for it personally, but I did see the extreme amount of people in line as I was exploring other (and better) food options. And now it's here not as a mobile restaurant, but an actual restaurant, hidden away in the Casino Royale.   To find it, you need to walk a little bit, so make time for that. I don't mind playing tourist in my own city every now and then, but lemme tell ya, for White Castle? Not worth it!  The little sliders are, at best, just cute. The meat was dry and it didn't help that the regular sliders were like 90% buns and meat. There were onions and pickles on it but it seemed like 2 little tiny pieces of diced onions, and a pickle the size of a dime. I prefer the cheese sliders over the regular ones.  About 5-6 sliders can fill me up really good on a hungry day, so order accordingly. The way they fill up the beer with the magnet is pretty cool! :) Oh, and perks, 10% off for locals with a local ID!  I'd say this place isn't really worth the hassle to get... maybe a good place to stop by when you're playing tourist in your own city, but that's about it.",-1,-1
"Growing up back east we would go to white castle and get the burgers by the dozen. Of course that was many years ago and you could get them for around 25 cents, that's really showing how long ago that was. So I was glad to see one open here on the strip. So I packed up the wife (who never had one) and off we went. After a short walk and a short line we ordered. Shocked by the prices, but everything costs more today. Told the wife how good these were while growing up. I guess all things change from what I remember. As soon as I pulled the burger from the package it seemed the burger was way thinner than I remembered and after the first bite I was disappointed on the taste. Guess this is off our list on coming back along with the ""shake shack"" also. How disappointed this was from the memories of my youth. Pay a little more and find one of the other burger places nearby so not to be disappointed.",-1,-1
"When the frozen burgers are better than the restaurant burgers, you have a big problem. Just. No. I'm sure the Midwest locations might be slightly better.",-1,-1
"We went here just because of the Harold and Kumar movie. Not worth the hype. The service was okay, but for the price definitely go somewhere else.",-1,-1
"Smaller menu and way overpriced compared to other white castles. If this was regular priced i would give it 3 or 4 stars because it is in par with most on the east coast but for almost $20 a person, no big red, and a really long line. I can only give it 2 stars but would doubt i would be back.",-1,-1
"The food was good as expected. However, the service was horrible. Shanon was there to give us our food but when we asked for sauces she was very disrespectful. We ordered a combo for 4 but she did not provide enough sauces for us. Also her side comments were very unfriendly when I pointed at the sauces she threatened that she would ""slap my hand"". I would say she is unfit for that position and she should just stay at the back of the house away from customers with that kind of attitude.",-1,-1
"Okay, don't expect any good quality food here.  The White Castle sliders in the frozen section in most grocery stores tastes almost EXACTLY like the sliders you will get here, except here, it's freshly cooked and not soggy!   You basically come here just cuz you can say you went to White Castle (without going to the East Coast).   The perfect snack after a day of drinking lol!",-1,-1
"I won't rate based on long lines and wait times. You obviously see how long the line is and should be able to judge that that wait will be lengthy. You get in line of your own free will, if you don't want to wait then go elsewhere. I also will not rate based on comparisons to other fast food empires (in-n-out, shake shack, McDonald's, etc).  What I am basing my rating in is the food. Let me be completely clear here...if you have ever had the frozen, microwaveable grocery store White Castle sliders then be advised that it is EXACTLY the same as what you will get here. Kudos (I guess) to whoever produces the frozen versions available at the grocery stores because they have 100% matched the taste, consistency, texture and quality of the famous White Castle slider. I wouldn't waste my money on that stuff at the market so I certainly would not ever walk in to another White Castle brick & mortar restaurant location. Sorry but there are WAY too many quality options in town to even consider wasting my time, money, or tastebuds on White Castle.",-1,-1
"Update: apparently they are supposed to be soggy, so if you like soggy buns then this is the place for you.",-1,-1
I had high hopes for this place.  First off they had my order wrong the lady working the cash register was rude and the food was terrible. The french fries were the only thing that I liked.  The burgers were just plain gross. For my first ever visit I had a terrible experience I won't be coming back to this place ever.,-1,-1
"I would give this place a MINUS one star if was possibly. Just another tourist trap on vegas strip. Over priced junk food. Meat that tastes like wet carboard, bland fries, NOTHING special about this place.  If this is one of the best burger restaurant chains in the east coast, and people like this crap, i would call them: ""IGNORANTS""  Another McDonald's dollar menu contestan that lose the battle......(and that's sad !!)",-1,-1
"What kind of ghetto operation is this?  Big sign saying open 24/7, but when I get off at 5am they are closed from 5 to 8am. What a joke. I am thoroughly pissed. You are false advertising. F-/&$k you White Castle!!!!!",-1,-1
Meh.  It tastes like the ones you buy in the frozen aisle and is nothing special.  Harold and Kumar what were you thinking... oh right...,-1,-1
"This is nice as a quick little snack. If there isn't a line, it's nice to pick up just a couple little sliders.  This last visit we tried to make it a meal, and ordered one of the big combo meals, but it's just too much fast food for me.  I guess I just much prefer a real burger with all of the vegetables.",-1,-1
"More hype than anything.  I've had my share of burgers including WC in NYC and they did not bring their A-game to LV.  Long lines, greasy burgers, no seating, and wafer thin patties for a premium price.  Also, if you've had WC on the Easy Coast, you'll be disappointed to find that they only sell the regular or cheese burgers and you can't buy them individually.   Only in meals.    I was pretty hungry the day I went, and didn't even eat all of my burgers. And it wasn't because I was full. Nuff said.",-1,-1
Overhyped! I don't get why people are so crazy about this place   Had this three times over my last Vegas trip but only because it was close to the palazzo and conveniently open 24hours so we could grab some grub after the club. It was okay the first time because I was drunk but the second night I was sober and it's really just mediocre. Everyone else devoured the sliders but I was far too sober to be enjoying them. Tastes like something I could've heated up from my freezer.   Pack of 10 costs about $11 and $3 extra if you want to add cheese But there's really nothing special or note worthy about the food.  It's just convenient and cheap considering it's Vegas  Might come back but only if I have mad drunchies next time I'm in Vegas,-1,-1
"I am from the East and have eaten white castles for a long time.  I love them and couldn't wait for them to get here I went the opening day.  i was not happy with the price.  They should be ashamed for charging people so much.  I brought them the first day and will not come back.  $8.99 for 4-cheeseburgers, fires, and soda are you people crazy.  My 11 yr old grand daughter can eat that and more because the burgers are so small. .I paid $15 plus some change for that combo plus 4-burgers.  That was my usual order after the club in Chicago and Minneapolis.  It  cost me $6 plus some change for the same order the last time I had them in Minneapolis.  I have not lived here that long so I have recently had white castles.  Just because it is on the strip that should not make such a big difference.  That is just pure greed!!!  if they open a store off the strip and the prices are within reason I would patronize that store but not on the strip ever again.  It is so sad that companies are so greedy, you people make enough profits give us a break.  This is why I am only giving one star and I hope others follow suit.",-1,-1
"Well, my experience at White Castle Las Vegas was consistent with a lot of others: just short of bad.   We stopped by midday and ordered one of the slider meals, adding mozzarella sticks to it. In the long wait for our food, I noticed that every person working behind the counter looked miserable. Everyone.   The food that comes out of this kitchen (despite its fast food quality) does not equate to the product sold elsewhere. Add to this the fact that prices are marked up to ""Strip value.""  Come to the Casino Royale to grab a few cheap beers at the bar adjacent to this place, but don't feel bad if you decide to skip White Castle.",-1,-1
"I had White Castle once before in when I was visiting Chicago and I didn't get it then.  When my sister-in-law saw that there was a White Castle in Las Vegas, one of her vacation stops here had to be White Castle--something that she fondly remembers from her youth.  I am still firmly in the I don't get it column.  There were three of us and we ordered a 10 pack bag with three bottles of water.  The sliders come out to be just over a dollar each but they were missing something.  Even the devoted sister-in-law thought they were missing at the very least some salt (and she doesn't use salt very much).    I was underwhelmed by the sliders.  The onion taste was about the best thing and it's really stretching it calling that little thin piece of beef a slider.  The thing is mostly bread.  Being in the Casino Royale doesn't make it an easily accessible place unless you're a tourist walking the Strip and decide to drop in.  We walked from the Venetian.  Again, I just don't get the cult following.  I'd rather spend a bit more and have something more substantial and a whole lot more flavorful!!",-1,-1
"I've watched the movie White Castle and they make White Castle taste like the best burgers ever, what a deception...yeah I know it's a movie, they marketed it very very well.  The burgers were eh, wouldn't recommend, there are plenty of other places to eat in Vegas. The only good thing is that it's cheap...",-1,-1
"The movie ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" was the only reason I wanted to eat White Castle.I waited 11 years to go to White Castle, 11 FREAKING YEARS!!! And I wish I didn't go, totally killed the joy of the movie for me. The sliders are whatever but i guess only good points was the restaurant is still new(ish) and service was great. You want a better burger go find an In'nOut or even Shake Shack which is 10x better.",-1,-1
"This is essentially microwave food. I got chicken rings and fries, my husband got sliders. Everything tasted like it came from a box. Actually...I may have had frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets that were better than what I had at White Castle. I see why Harold and Kumar went after getting stoned--you would have to be under the influence of something to enjoy your meal.  Plus, everything was really pricy. We paid $17 for microwave food. Never again!",-1,-1
"The movie was awesome, unfortunately can't say the same for the actual restaurant. I went to this specific White Castle during a Vegas weekend. I was expecting delicious small burger sliders with a side of fries for the amount of money I paid. It was horrible. And I don't blame any staff, this iPad to do with the quality of the burger. They basically tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you get at a local food market. Very disappointing. I couldn't even finish the small lil burgers. Would never recommend this franchise to anyone until they find a better supplier for their patties. And stop using microwave food. The fries were ok. The instructions say to ""put mustard on this review"" (and I wish I woulda put some On that horrible burger) but I don't wanna sound like I'm trashing this franchise blatantly, I'm sure there's a few that will appreciate the quality of these small burgers. Good luck White Castle! Hope you get better, being this is our first west coast franchise.    Ps: don't let the movie fool you!",-1,-1
"Stumbled upon this place while walking the Strip and I just had to try it just because. I only ordered a Cheddar Fries and 1 Burger. I am glad that's all I ordered because it did not taste good at all. First off, the service is cap. They didn't really care about you. The cheddar fries was nothing exciting, it had stale fries. The burger is just nasty! It's soggy with no flavor. Maybe if you are drunk and hungry you can eat here but other than that, I would pass.",-1,-1
"The hype with this one was strong.  What with the constant talk on local news stations, blogs, websites how could you not feel the pressure as a lover of food in Las Vegas? We were not immune to the build-up and thus had to see what we were missing all these years.  We visited on a Saturday, early evening/late afternoon timeframe. The place was busy, but that was no surprise with the aforementioned popularity still booming. The line was relatively long but moved at a decent rate. They do well to get you through and on your way. We waited about 15-20 minutes in line. The menu is simpler than most fast food type joints with limited offerings. Think somewhere between In n Out and Chil Fil A. I appreciate this; makes it easier for someone like me who wants to get right to the ""bread and butter"" if you will and skip over their second rate items. The sliders were much smaller than we expected; again we've never had even the frozen grocer variety so expectations were only speculative. It reminded me of a plain McDonalds burger with the small chopped onions being one of the only things on the burgers other than the meat. The fries were nothing special. Not great but also without any major flaw. Straightforward French fries. Our meal was over in less than 10 min and we left feeling quite disappointed, and overall confused about the hype.  Guess it's just one of those things that you either get or you don't.  And I don't.",-1,-1
Leave it to Las Vegas to ruin a Midwest gem. I was looking forward to White Castle being here but it is definitely not the same. I expected there to be a wait so I won't complain about the 1 hour and a half that I stood in line but I will complain that the line is like General admission for the club. I don't think they thought thoroughly about having a line outside on a busy strip sidewalk. Also I wasn't that far back in the line so I thought once I got into the building I would be minutes from ordering. Okay so the food; when I received my burgers they were lukewarm after coming fresh off of a grill! I also ordered chicken rings and they didn't have honey mustard! Dont even get me started on the employees! They need to bring some people from the MIDWEST to train these people. For those who have not had White Castle before this is not what all of us Midwest folks were excited about! It wasn't nearly the experience from back home! I agree with those that said you can go to the frozen section for what they are serving up here. Also they need to figure out how to get one off of the strip and with a drive-thru and breakfast. I will not be returning to this location.,-1,-1
"Nasty!!!  Our first experience here was when they first opened...its was good! Food was good, customer service was good. This time its completely different. Burns gross fries, horrible nasty ""customer"" service, sent the fries back to only get back-talk from one of the employees!! Who does that!!! I'm guessing poor management is to blame? I'm not sure. The only thing good was the sliders!",-1,-1
"Came here for the first time with my husband to see what all the hype was about. It was disgusting. I took 1 bite and was done. My husband forced himself to finish 2 sliders. We had stomachs afterwards. They tasted not fresh and maybe even frozen. Buns were soggy and meat slices are super thin. I got cheese fries and they were ok, nothing special. Only good thing we experienced was great customer service from the cashier. I wish I would've caught her name, but she was the only good thing that came off that place. Save your money and go elsewhere.",-1,-1
They've lied to us people.... i don't know how they were able to make a movie about it.,-1,-1
"The grossest thing I've ever consumed. I would've been better off getting the frozen ones from the freezer section. I will never eat this place again. And after we complained they didn't even seem to care nor bother to help fix the situation. Save your money, go somewhere else!!",-1,-1
"I stopped at White Castle around 4 A.M. since it was near my hotel and open 24/7. I ordered 3 classic sliders while my friends ordered the original slider combo. The line was long and took me 10 minutes to order and another 10 minutes to get my food.   When I got my food, I was disappointed. In no way did that resemble a burger slider. The bottom bun was so soggy that it stuck to the packaging. The burger patty was probably 3 millimeters thick. It came with one pickle and grilled onions. The fries were soggy as well and tasted like plastic. The fries tasted like they were frozen and reheated in a microwave. To top it off, the food was not worth the money. It costs almost $10 for a slider combo (drink, fries, 3 slider). I paid $1.30 for each slider that you could finish in 2 bites. The best part of the meal was the drink.  The food here closely resembles the frozen, microwaved lunch you get in elemenatry school. One star because it is open 24/7.",-1,-1
"I've always wanted to try White Castle, even before the movie came out and now that I've tried it...it's nothing special.  I would rather have In and Out or eat at McD.  The burgers lacked any flavor but at least the buns were good.  I should've just went to Shake Shack against my better judgement.  The best part of the meal was the chicken ring sandwich.  Too bad 2 meals of chicken ring sandwiches and two sliders costed 25 bucks.  Never again.",-1,-1
My wife had bragged about White Castle for a long time about how good their sliders were and how you could eat a whole sack of them.  When we got to White Castle my wife immediately ordered 20 for the two of us.  After trying one slider I was so disappointed the burger was so bland and nasty.  My wife was equally as disappointed and we both opted to throw them away rather than suffer through trying to eat them... Extremely disappointed and sad for my wife who thought she was going to enjoy a childhood favorite... I had better burger at McDonalds.,-1,-1
They list this place as a fast food restaurant but more like a SLOW food Restraunt! The manager should be taken out back and beaten! 4th of July holiday and they have one person working a register and a line out the door! Heaven for bid the manager throws a few more employees on registers to speed up the process or hops on one himself! Worst run business! If u see a line go somewhere else like I did after waiting 30 minutes and not moving as it will be a two hour wait just to order!The debate of $15/hour makes me laugh when I see how a business like this is run! Can't wait till the day they replace workers with computers so we can place our own orders and not have to wait an hour in line at a Slow food Restraunt!,-1,-1
"My husband and I had never been to White Castle before so we decided to give them a try out of curiosity. We stopped by on Saturday afternoon around 5:30, it took 45 minutes to wait and order, then another 10 to receive our meal which wasn't too bad.  We were able to find a little spot to sit in really quick, the table was clean but the space was tiny. The employees that I dealt with were friendly.   I can say that I am glad we took the safe route and ordered very little food, better safe than sorry. I got combo #2 which comes with 4 cheese sliders, an order of fries and a drink for $8.99, I also ordered 6 additional cheese sliders, an order of onion chips, and a fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick (additional burgers were for the kids at home). I ordered all of the cheese sliders without onions. When our number was called my husband picked up the order and brought it back to the table. I opened the bag up and noticed no cheese and onions on the first slider, so it took out one after another and noticed they all had no cheese but they did all have onions, on top of that, I didn't receive my cheesecake. I put the sliders back in the bag and took them back, they threw the sliders away and I waited another 10 minutes to receive the ""correct"" order. First 4 sliders were fine, cheese and no onions, other 6, cheese with onions. WTF! My receipt clearly stated cheese and no onions for all 10 sliders! At that point I was annoyed so I didn't take them back to the front counter, but seriously, you must really not know what you're doing if you get my order wrong twice. To top it off the burgers were semi-warm, they should be glad I didn't become very disgruntled.  I honestly wasn't impressed with the tiny burgers, I took a bite and to my surprise, it tasted just like a McDonald's $1 cheeseburger. The slider consisted of a bun, thin patty, and sliced pickles. The fries weren't anything special either, they tasted just like the crinkle cut fries that you buy at the grocery store and fry up yourself. Onion chips were okay, they were very crisp and had a semi sweet taste to them. The best part of the meal was my orange fanta beverage and the fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick. We spent $25 on our meal and thought it was a complete waste. Meal #2 comes with enough food to fill up a hungry toddler, not an adult. The cost is not justifiable to me, too little food for the price, $1.50 for a tiny cheese slider, no thanks.   I came, I tasted, too over-hyped.",-1,-1
"I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world.  Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.  Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings?  Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning.",-1,-1
"Service was good.  The cleanliness was a bit lacking as staff was not clearing tables very quickly.  This would be 1 start if they didn't sell beer...  The sliders are okay at best; I am unsure of where all of the hype comes from.  If fast food burgers are your goal, I would pick In-N-Out before going to White Castle.  If you compared it to any sort of restaurant style burger, you would remove White Castle from your memory, never to be thought of again.    Don't want to make the journey to WC?  The frozen versions from the Super Market are just as good as at WC.",-1,-1
"I used to eat these when I was a teen, so I was super hyped when they opened here in LV...I went down to the strip (no parking) I ordered 10 sliders $16.00 they were 49 cents each 20 years ago???? they were so greasy I almost could not digest 2 of them. Know I know why my mother used to say when I was a kid that every time she ate them she got the runs....",-1,-1
The food was ok.  All the workers looked like they hated being here.  All looked unhappy. The cashier seemed nice.  Slow as molasses.  I cashier for about 50 people in line.  What a mess this place is,-1,-1
Have been wanting to try this place after seeing it in the movie years ago.  finally one here in Vegas but we were not fans.,-1,-1
I was not wowed at all. We just wanted to try it. Had sliders and fries. Meat is thin. Buns are good but greasy. Too much butter. Fries are soft. Super crowded and seating is limited. I don't know what I was expecting but I left unsatisfied.,-1,-1
"Looked good when Harold and Kumar ate it in the movie. Thought we gave it a try since it opened here. Much more costly than other states i heard as it's suppose to be a quarter each. We got 4 cheeseburger sliders with a drink and fries and it was $8.99.  The sliders were pretty gross. I think some frozen sliders even taste better. The bread were soggy on the bottom as if my bun was accidentally dropped in water. What makes it worse is its not water but the bun soaked up the fat juice from the meat (which some may like but a soggy bun, no thank you). The meat looked old and not fresh at all. One picture that a fellow yelper posted says it all.   Service was ok. Some were super nice while some looked as if they just crawled out of bed or have a bad hangover. Definitely a one time visit for me. Never again.",-1,-1
I think I will stick with the frozen ones.  The prices are overpriced and almost twice as much as the frozen ones that taste almost the same.,-1,-1
"Save yourself a handful of dollars, time, and driving-on-the-strip-ness and just buy a box of frozen ones at your local grocer. They'll taste better than the ones here and you won't have to deal with a casino full of smoke and other aggravations.  Expensive, long line, nowhere to sit and eat in the place itself, even at odd hours of the morning. Enjoy sitting in the dark food court away from the place itself.  The fries were pretty bad, too, somehow stale even with as busy as it was.",-1,-1
"My experience here was not how I envisioned it. I envisioned my experience at White Castle the same as Harold and Kumar, enjoying endless sliders in absolute joy, basically having the best meal of my young life. Unfortunately that does not hold true and eating at White Castle makes me appreciate In-N-Out that much more.   The sliders here are very thin, soggy, and underwhelming. They do have a strong flavor of onion as they are grilled on a bed of onions. The price of each slider is pretty ridiculous at 1.29 each because you need about 4-5 to be anywhere near satisfied.   I happened to enjoy the chicken ring slider, as it was fulfilling and lathered with some liquid crack, in the form of cheese, which was very pleasant to eat. If I was hella drunk out of my mind I would probably order 20 of these easy.   The onion peels take on the shape of a garlic clove and are deep fried. They taste just like onion rings and are not anything too special at all.   I wouldn't mind coming back to White Castle if it somehow it magically ended up in the Bay Area, but if I'm in Vegas again, I would definitely waste my money on something actually worth spending on.",-1,-1
"First time eating at White Castle. We've all seen the movie....so I was stoked to finally check this off the bucket list. I was, unfortunately, disappointed. My issue lies not with the staff or cleanliness of the restaurant....even the prices were not bad. It's the food! The sliders taste EXACTLY like the frozen ones sold in your local grocer's freezer. If I did the Pepsi challenge with a frozen slider and one from the restaurant....I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Skip it.",-1,-1
Don't know what the big deal is. Meat in the burger thin and small.  Tastes ok for me. Given the hype when it was opened expected something better.,-1,-1
"The smallest Burger I ever have. It looks cute, but taste was below average, but it only cost 1.29, what can I complain, pay what u get.",-1,-1
"My review in one word... YUCK!   I was so excited to try these little sliders, so my husband, our friend and I decided to go and we ordered their 20 slider combo. My husband is a picky eater so we ordered 15 with everything and 5 without onions or pickles. After waiting like 15 minutes for our order of course all 20 sliders had onions and pickles, so we had to order 5 more. Like I said... Yuck!! We were hungry as hello so I ended up eating 5, our friend 7 and my husband 4, we threw the rest away!! :(   I guess these are popular in the East Coast because they don't have In-n-Out!!",-1,-1
"Well well well i realize its opening day and it went pretty well for a 2 1/2 hour wait in line and 33 mins to get our food.... All was hood except the smokers who didnt care and at the very end of what could have been at least 4 stars... Riley at the door was belligerent to me when i came back in to get my daughter who was waiting on the food.... Too bad with the prices SO high, the novelty is a 80 cent burger they are 1.59 with cheese. Really guys? You wont make enough? This is a great way to run off your locals, trust me, youll regret it!",-1,-1
"had never been... not worth the walk! it was a fun experience since it's one of those places made famous by the movies, but not something I could imagine ever craving.",-1,-1
Typical franchise location that created a ton of hype only to disappoint with frozen disgusting meat and a dirty and extremely crowded dining room.  The meat was just more like a thinly slice of roast beef that lacks flavor.,-1,-1
"After walking up and down the Strip twice I was craving some White Castle almost as much as Roldy and Kumar!  From the outside it looked like a tiny standalone but actually the location is inside the Casino Royale.  Got the #7 Castle Pack, which was 10 sliders, two regular fries and two drinks.  Service was good as they got my order out quickly in spite of the place being packed but for my first time eating White Castle burgers at a White Castle I was rather disappointed.   These certainly did not hit the spot! I know sliders don't have much meat but these were practically meatless! And the onions could've tasted a whole lot better. The Fries were meh too as they were a bit soggy.  Not gonna lie, I enjoyed the microwave White Castle burgers you get from the grocery better...",-1,-1
"It's... fine.  I'm not really sure what I was expecting, but this has been a questionable item on my bucket list since the first Harold and Kumar movie.  Being a west coast girl, this was adventurous fast food cuisine for me.  Turns out the hamburgers taste pretty much exactly like the microwaved versions you buy in the grocery store.  The chicken rings taste a bit like breaded shoe leather, definitely don't bother ordering those.  There can be a a significant wait to get your order, and the dining area is suffused with a quiet, desperate sadness, so if there are no available tables, go get (a lot) of drinks elsewhere and try again later.",-1,-1
"After all those days of feasting on frozen white castle burgers... I finally tried it for real... and the disappointment was real...  My friend and I were ambition as hell and ordered the 30-pack of cheeseburgers.... after our lunch which was no more than 2 hours prior. That was about 2250 calories for each of us... (A package of 2 frozen ones is like 300 calories). We took our first bites and continued to much due to excitement... but the flavor sunk in. Wait, scratch that, what flavor? Compared to their frozen counterparts, these lacked salt, umami, msg, etc etc. Not satisfying at all... we left defeated.",-1,-1
"I dont get it....sorry. Tasteless little nuggets of some kinda meat, and fries that are no better than Del Taco. Service was friendly and quick and she asked if I were a local (which I am) so she gave me a little discount. Not sure what the appeal is but I'd pass on by next time. Even in a drunken hunger this place didn't satisfy.",-1,-1
"There isn't a White Castle in the DC metro area, so I definitely had to visit when I was in Vegas.   The sliders didn't look appetizing but tasted decent. This is definitely an establishment to visit after having a long night at the bars.  Next time, I'll take advantage of the close proximity of In N Out instead. At least they have top quality burgers for a better price.",-1,-1
Harold & Kumar does not justify White Castle. the hype is ridiculous. Or Vegas White Castle is not as tasteful as expected. What an unfortunate turn of events. At least we gave it a shot.   if you want what I encountered at White Castle then head to your nearest grocery store & purchase the frozen pack. That's all.,-1,-1
"Next time you see the line and ask yourself ""is it worth it?""  ANSWER- NO!!!!!   Great food.. Terrible service. I get that it's a Friday night and you are understaff but to treat your customers with disrespect and roll your eyes when you serve them their food is just degrading. It's not that hard to make 20 sliders for someone. Especially after you already made 20+ for someone who ordered after.   ""Here's your order (as she slaps the bag on the counter)"" -staff  Just rude. Ps. 40 min after we orders   Been there, done that, never going to do it (in vegas) again.",-1,-1
"Not sure how you managed to screw up a Chicago institution... but you did.   I have been going to white castle since I was little in Chicago. Cheap, hot, tasty little meat treats. The highlight was the warm juicy onions against that little crunch of pickle.   The location in vegas has just missed the boat. They were tastless, over salted and soggy. I was so ticked I went to the manager and said these are not white castles. He asked me where I was from, told him, he laughed and said me too, then he went back there and made me some himself. Those tasted right.   Ultimatly I think it is the fact that you have non-chicagoans trying to make vintage Chicago food. It would be like having a blind guy pick your wardrobe... he can get close because someone told him about the colors but never dead on because having never experiance them, he doesn't  really know what the colors are. (No that's not a dig on blind people). Same deal here...",-1,-1
"Honetly I came here at 3 in the morning (its a 24 hour location) and the line was ridiculous. Nothing but drunk people screaming at the workers and women with barely any clothes on walking around. I really felt as if I was in a nasty club with really bad lighting.   It took almost an hour to get my food, the workers looked tired, overworked, and unappreciated. I felt so bad people were yelling at them cursing them out saying mean things to them, It was really bad.   On top of that, I ordered the chicken rings and try were extremely dry and hard. The shake was about 7 dollars and not great. Overall I wont be coming back, but I hope that the people that work here can get a nice vacation some day because what they go through is atrocious.",-1,-1
We parked at Venetian and walked over. Found out there was a White Castle in Vegas and had to go. We stopped by after a show at the Mandalay at around 1am.   Great place to go for a late late night snack....if you're wasted. This is totally drunk food. Don't come here if you're sober. The meat was thin and flavorless. It resembled Spam. Service was super quick though. Fries were the best part of the meal. I would love to try White Castle again...but not in Vegas.,-1,-1
"It was husbands pick.  Heard about the lines on opening day so I was worried that it might be crowded but alas it was not at all and I can see why.  It is connected to the Casino Royale but has its own store front so you literally pass it when walking on the strip.  You can see and hear slots in the dining room.   I've tried them in the frozen aisle before and ended up tossing the rest of the box because I thought they were awful then.  I was hoping that maybe getting it fresh would make a difference.  UM, no.  They were pretty awful.  Patty is thin as paper with no flavor.  Bread is soft and soggy.  Price was also a lot for the quality you get.  $7.99 for 4 sliders, ordinary crinkle fries and a drink but it could be because they are on the strip.  Even my husband was not crazy about them either.  It was good enough to try once but I won't be coming back.  I just don't get the fascination?  Give me In and Out Burger anyday.  Heck even Burger King beats it and I can't stand Burger King.  They get an extra star for friendly staff. As for the complaint about the trays, that is the least of their problem.  The whole thing was so bland.  Would be good for kids.",-1,-1
Food is whack....don't know what Harold and Kumar were craving...don't this crap here...In-N-Out rules here...,-1,-1
"This was just freaking gros in my opinion, a couple of my friends liked it, for me the smell alone was enough for me to hurl. But as a foodie groupie such as myself lol, i don't let smell detour me its unfair. First off this place is constantly packed, fast service though. Price is a tad below average which is a small plus seeing its located on the strip. You might notice that the place is a dump in the inside, understandbly so many people. As for the burgers/sliders they were tiny and light and also tasteless nothing to write about but an after taste that stays in your mouth tasting like old onion. I went to use their toilets after waiting in line for 5 minutes, just as disgusting , it looks like the burgers rushed out of people's systems in a hurry. Save some gambling money eat somewhere better, this place is for the those in desperation to eat cheap.",-1,-1
"I gave into the hype. I just had to, even though reviews weren't great. Well, shocker, White Castle wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Burgers are basic but just really taste like bread. Fries were plain jane. No ranch dressing available to dip any of this in to make it better!   Now I can say I've been to White Castle, an I definitely don't have to go again!",-1,-1
"Being a California guy I've always wanted to try White Castle (yes cause of Harold and Kumar) these burgers are crap, nothing special about them, fries were barely decent",-1,-1
"Must be a nostalgia thing. The wife always wanted to try one as she had family who loved these. Neither one of us can figure what the draw is. Not real burger tasting or anything to make it stand out. If you just want to say you had one then give it a go, at least it's not real pricey.",-1,-1
"White Castle in NY is the best. When I visit that place is a must eat, a few times during visit we buy by the case. Well I live in henderson for 8 years. They were in silverton casino for the food truck fair. I waited in line for over an hour. They were worth waiting for. Cost 1.00 each. Today I went to the strip to get some. Very disappointed.    The burgers were over cooked, no ketchup , no salt and the roll was like it was sitting unwrapped for hours. Dry and firm.Like a hamburger roll gets when left in sun.  In NY you are able to watch them make them. Seems like they are not making them the same way.  Corporate needs to bring out someone to train them and I don't  mean a manager. There was a lady in NY that was there for over 20 years. Food could be good but the chef has to cook it good.......",-1,-1
"First off, it's definitely not worth the 2 + hour wait. Wait like a month or so to go when the hype is over. My friend and I, being locals, drove from Henderson to the strip to try White Castle out. My family is from the east coast so I've experienced it before, but my friend hadn't.  After our long wait, I ordered a combo with 4 sliders, a side, and a drink and I ordered the 10 slider pack to take back home to my grandma. My friend ordered 4 sliders, a side, and a drink. I received my order fairly quickly after ordering.  I ate my food and waited an extra 30 minutes before my friend got his. I order 10 more sliders than he did. He went up 3 times to ask what was taking so long and the guy calling out orders said he had his ticket there and he would call him. Still nothing. He finally went and asked the cooks and they made his sliders right then and there. I don't see what the problem was.  Also, two of my sliders had a pickle and two didn't. The fact that they are already inconsistent is pretty bad.",-1,-1
2 stars cause the guy cleaning tables was quick and very friendly. Otherwise... This doesn't really taste like white castles from back home. Way soggy.,-1,-1
"Eh...not impressed and not worth the hype. Very little meat (almost paper thin), fries were dry, and more like ore ida frozen fries. Just really not impressed.",-1,-1
Late night munchies! Line was long and the security guards act like they're PD.... it's a white castle for God's sake... ! Oh yeah...get ready for some mean gas!  Fart game food. Most definitely a good time to play the fart game after eating at this place. Are the sliders on the east coast soggy because this place had the soggiest of the soggy.  Not a big fan. The microwave white castle burgers were way better and didn't give me the farts.,-1,-1
"I'm from New York where we could get these any time. When I moved here 15 years ago, I called corporate and inquired about opening a franchise out here. No go, All stores are corporate owned. Bought the boxed frozen White Castle's from Smiths for years. Finally was so excited they opened a store out here. Finally made time to go and check it out. Really? The burgers here don't even compare to the frozen boxed ones, and are not even in the same ball park of the traditional ones from NY. They tasted horrible! And in NY they never had pickles on them, where did that come from? In NY we jokingly called them belly bombs, out here they truly are! My stomach hurt for 2 days after eating this crap. I am truly disappointed here and will NEVER go back to this store. The boxed ones at Smiths are WAY better and closer to the real thing you get in NY.",-1,-1
"Having lived primarily on the west coast, I have never had the opportunity to go to a White Castle. So whenever I went on a trip to the East Coast, I tried to make White Castle a must visit place. Unfortunately, it always eluded me, thus making the allure of White Castle that much greater. Even when it made its appearance at the food truck festivals, I opted not to wait in the 3 hour line. so when I heard they opened up a location on the strip, I figured I'd try it once and for all. And no, the Wal-Mart ones don't count. I also understand ones expectations usually does not meet their perception when yearning for so long. Plus I heard it's overrated. So when I tried it, I wasn't surprised it wouldn't live up to the hype. But what I didn't expect was for the frozen Wal-Mart ones to be better. That's right, I said it. I like my microwave sliders better. Maybe they rushed to get all orders out quickly, which is why my order felt on the cool side. i have to say though, I went on a Wednesday night and got my order quickly. So that's a plus right? So to end my review, I'll say it was ok. Worth the hype? Nah. Will I go back? Probably not. Vegas is surrounded by burger joints in the same price range. So I think I'll just check this off my list of places to try and move along.",-1,-1
I once waited an hour for a seventh course meal and it was still faster than this.  Only reason I even attempted to wait this long is because I made myself believe that the bun was made of Egyptian papyrus scrolls and the meat was made of brontosaurus....,-1,-1
"Not worth it. Go to in n out. Or any other burger joint if possible. The service was good but the food wasn't. Very bland, the pickle was the best part.",-1,-1
If I can give this place 0 starts I would !!!! It's the worst place I ever had in my life . I rather eat Burger King . The hype is honestly not worth it !!,-1,-1
"It's nice that we have a White Castle, but the price is too high for the quality of the experience.  The onion crisps are very nice, though.",-1,-1
"This was on my list of food places I had to try when I visited Vegas. I've always been a fan of the frozen ones. I grew up eating those. When I finally visited on 12/17/16, I was sooooo disappointed.   I came pretty late at night and there was a line of people. The line went by fast and I ordered the original slider, cheese slider, chicken ring slider, and the onion chips. Total came to under $20 I recall which is not bad. Food came out fast and I was ready to dig in. The sliders were about the same size as the frozen ones but it seemed a bit smaller, maybe that's just me. But as others have pointed out, these taste just like the store bought ones. Depending on you, this could be a good thing? Maybe you like the consistency?   But like others, I was just expecting so much more!! I blame the hype surrounding White Castle. This place is too hyped up and I'm not sure how others could give it 3+ stars.   Don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna eat my frozen White Castle sliders. But don't bother going to the actual restaurant. You'll be disappointed!  Onion chips are good tho...?? I guess",-1,-1
"Four words. Over priced and over hyped. Thumps down. I know your known for small burgers, but seriously guys 5 french fries for $3 dollars is ridiculous.   ****Beware!! Patron here only if you are heavily intoxicated. (You will not enjoy these sober.)",-1,-1
1star is being generous !!!!  Disgusting burger ... I got the 4 burger meal  3 of the 4 burgers did not have a pickle and the onions were not fresh   the fries were not hot ---- yuk !!   tables dirty - floors sticky - health dept needs to do an inspection,-1,-1
"I really didn't think the sliders were that good here. It seems all hype and its so busy since it's usually on the East Coast and this is the closest location to me (I'm from CA). I don't know if it's worth coming here and looking for this if you're on the strip like we did... The sliders and chicken rings tasted microwaveable and the French fries tasted old and weren't crunchy. My friend also said it tasted just like the ones you can get at the store. The sliders are so small too and they only have a thin piece of meat, cheese, onions and a pickle--not what I was expecting.   #2-- 4 cheese sliders, a small fry and a soft drink were not worth $9.27. Good thing I split it with a friend and we got more food after!   I'm sorry White Castle... I'm not sure if I'll be back. :(",-1,-1
Got a crave case. Majority of the burgers were luke warm or half cold and thrown together sloppily. Time of day was around 3:30am and it wasn't crazy busy.   Spent almost $50 and could have done way better with $15 at dell taco.  The best part of this experience was the smoke drenched casino attached and the jameson filled Irish coffee you can get while waiting 30min to get inside.   If you want White Castle go to the frozen food section at your local grocery store.,-1,-1
I ordered one of the combinations and let me start by saying that it was like the food was mush in small buns nasty. the sad part was I really excited to try their food!,-1,-1
"Wow, this is the worst thing I have ever had. This is not a hamburger I'm not quite sure what this is but it's terrible. I would rather eat a jack in the box and that's not saying much. I'm not sure why people keep telling me this place is good.",-1,-1
"Not impressed at all! Was looking forward to this Whitecastle as I had eaten the sliders from the frozen food aisle in the grocery store when I was a teenager. I guess it would be different if I grew up with them and it was nostalgic, but I didn't and they're just gross and $1.59 per slider with cheese... Ridiculous!  Excellent customer service, though...nice people!",-1,-1
That was probably the most disgusting burger I have ever had. I could only eat the fries. lol,-1,-1
"The verdict is in......it's a 'Naah' for me. I had been wanting to check this place out after seeing it on a cooking channel about fast food burgers. My little itty bitty teenie weenie, did I mention teenie weenie, oh yea I did, super micro thin patty was a sight to behold if I could find the darn thing! I have never experienced a meat slider so tiny before. The flavor was very meh and it was just very lack luster. The onion finger thingy's were good, they tasted like a crispy onion ring. The fries were the average crinkle frozen fries so party there. Overall, I didn't like it enough to eat there again. On to the next spot!",-1,-1
"It's an experience not to be repeated.  The burgers are slider size which is fine but they have no taste, ours weren't even warm and why would you want to stand in line for that?",-1,-1
This place was the worst! They hype up this place too much. DO NOT GO IN THERE WITH EXPECTATIONS!!! The burgers look fake and ridiculously tiny.  Sad to say but McDonalds is better! Never again,-1,-1
"We were so excited to try this place and we highly disappointed. Unfortunately, $60 worth of food went into the garbage. What a waste!",-1,-1
"Las Vegas White Castle is NOTHING like an ORIGINAL White Castle. VERY rude staff. Las Vegas White Castle is nothing like the original White Castle we use to eat from, back in Michigan. The food does not taste the same like the White Castles in Midwest.. They don't even offer their best burgers in a the Las Vegas location.",-1,-1
"Currently drunk,  hungover or nearly out of money should be the only reason to stop here.  It does the job of filling you up for a low price.  Nothing special except for the people watching.",-1,-1
"I remember as a kid having White Castle from the frozen food section of the grocery store and I was not too impressed with them back then. So when we saw they had a location to try on the strip I was interested in trying them. Well the taste is no better then what you would get from the grocery store, so might as well stick with that if they are the same plus you don't have to wait in long lines like you do at this place. On the bright side they are pretty inexpensive compared to the other food choices offered on the strip.",-1,-1
"I was actually expecting something... more exciting.   My friends and I ordered the sliders.  They tasted pretty okay. The soft texture of the bun, the thin patty, and the diced onions, reminded me of the little hamburgers in the Happy Meals from McDonalds. The presentation is cool and all, with the little boxes, but other than that, there's really nothing special about them.   And the way that it's so hard to find somewhere to sit and how messy the area is.. it just kills the appeal some more for me.",-1,-1
Was expecting sooooo much but was soooo underwhelmed.  I couldn't even get ketchup or mustard on my burger! Come on man! So disappointed. Better off getting the frozen ones! Oh and it's like triple the price from back home!,-1,-1
"The place looks okay, but nothing that's too appetizing that I would like yo come back here.  My husband and I tried chicken, beef, and fish sliders. And all three of them didn't live up to the flavor, didn't like the food at all.",-1,-1
"I just want to point out how thin these ""hamburger patties"" are. This place was full of mediocracy. 12 buck on 4 sliders and cheese bacon fries and we are leaving less than dissatisfied. 2 stars because the fries were good but save your self some time and walk a little bit down the strip to a joint called in-n-out! So sad, because we were excited to try something from the east coast!!! Maybe it's just this place, I will give White Castle another try while in NY. But never here again",-1,-1
"When I found out they were opening a white castle here I was pretty excited. I had only ever had the ones in the freezer section, which a friend told me was not ""real White Castle."" Spoiler alert: they were basically identical. I didn't come here looking for some amazing burgers but I was looking for something worth all the hype. $6 for 4 little sliders seems pretty pricey. These things taste just like McDonald's double cheeseburgers except they are about a third of the size and the same price. Luckily there was no line when I came. The extra star is basically just because the employees were nice.",-1,-1
"This is the WORST WORST WORST PLACE. It is over hyped. Watching Harold and Kumar made me think this place was going to be awesome, BUT NO. This place is horrible. I have the food, the fries were not even great. And the meat...is that even meat? It comes with pickles and onions. If you have ever been to inn n out you would know that it's not comparable at all. I don't know why everyone loves it. I absolutely despise it. The wait is about 10-15 minutes and its definitely not even worth a second of it. The only thing I enjoyed was my soda...",-1,-1
"If you're looking for garbage, this is the place to go. Came here in the AM expecting some decent, if not lower quality food to fill my drunken hungry state. The quality and taste of this food is absolutely appalling. This establishment needs to shut itself down for the betterment of he public. The only reasonably enjoyable portion of my meal was the soda that came from the soda machine.",-1,-1
"The 2 stars are exactly what it means. I have experienced better. Whether it is the frozen ones at Smiths in the frozen food section or sliders from other restaurants, the actual sliders I had here at this location was mediocre at best if I was I really hungry.  Im trying to understand how east coast  peeps grew up on this garbage. This is definitely one of those spots that are severely hyped up because of the fact that this is the only White Castle closest to the west coast. The funny thing is that the first day they opened, they ran out of food! What a fail on their part. You're open 24 hours. You know you're gonna have patrons lined up for miles but yet you just happen to run out of product.   I knew eventually I had to try it just to see what the hype was. I have only tried the frozen ones so far. So a couple of my friends are here from out of town. Of course they want to try it. So off we went.  Located just inside the Casino Royale just right off the strip, you line up starting outside if it is really busy. One thing is for sure, I dont think this casino has never seen so many people in their establishment. Since it is a part of the casino, you will be exposed to the smoke factor. You cant smoke where you can sit down and eat your burger but yet you will be inhaling enough of it coming from the casino itself. They have security posted outside where the line begins and one right at the door where you enter.  So far I have gone 4 paragraphs without any mention of what we ordered. That just shows you how really bad the food is. While my wife went and stayed in line to order food, I scoped out a table. She came back with two craver packs for our group along with loaded fries and 4 drinks. The total came out to 51 bucks and some change.   I was somewhat hungry so I ate 2 regular sliders with cheese. In the other craver pack I also ate 2 regular sliders with pepper jack cheese. Now I LOVE onions but the ones they put in these sliders taste like reconstituted onions. You know, the dry kind that has to be mixed with water to bring it back to life. Then they grill it. The smell of it now that I think about it almost makes me want to vomit. The patty itself does not look like a real beef patty. Referring to my pic, it looks more like prop comparable to those fake plastic fruits you will see in some people's homes. The only thing that may have peaked my interest was the pepper jack cheese. Had a little kick to it. As for the loaded fries, I was no longer in the mood to eat after surprisingly eating 4 sliders.  Service was actually decent, otherwise this would be a 1 star review. From standing outside to making it in to order, all took a total of about 25 minutes with 10 waiting for our finished product after ordering. They have one security guard outside to watch the line while another one is at the door entrance to make sure nobody cuts. This was surprisingly organized. Too bad that's it. Oh and that they are open 24 hours would be the other thing.  In closing, if you have never been here, by all means, try it out so you can make up your own mind if its worthy of a trip to the Casino Royale. I mean, you don't really hear too many people talk about going to the strip just to go to a not too well known casino.

Absolute trash. I've heard so many stories from my friends on why I must try out White Castle burgers so sure enough I went. It was about 1 AM and I was starving so I dropped by to get some burgers. Given that I was starving and have heard such great things about this place I was very excited.  Little did I know this place is literally the worst burger joint I have ever gone too. Their burgers look like they are frozen and then simply just microwaved. I would NEVER come back here again and would advise that everyone stay away.,-1,-1
"My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch today. We wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Neither one of us was impressed. I had to choke, literally choke down my sliders, then was nauseous the rest of the evening. Buns, were soggy, meat tasted old. Fries were of the frozen variety, not evenly cooked or seasoned. We paid roughly $10 for the #2 and shared it.. let's just say I can get a steak and lobster for that price in town and not be sick or disappointed. We can say we've  scratched it off of our bucket list, but will not be back.",-1,-1
White Castle of the East on the Vegas of the West!  I've been to a White Castle before in the Bronx of NYC wile on tour being that is the only other time I've actually had their food you so know that we are going here especially late night after a few drinks!  Being from California we don't have White Castles anywhere around so we go to In In Out and it's always just magically delicious and what we crave!  The burgers here were soggy but I think it's because they steam them overall I'm not a fan of soggy buns I wasn't impressed enough by the burgers to ever really want to visit one of their locations again.  The onion chips were decently good though and went well with their BBQ sauce and made your burger taste a bit better if you added one to it.  The other thing I thought was funky was how they had chicken rings and onion chips either way I don't find my self craving anything from here like they advertise.  The line moves fairly quick though well at least for us it did as well as our food came out quickly too!  They sell beer here too so that's definitely awesome if your in it for a burger and beer!  Well what I will say is if you have never visited a White Castle and your next to one after you've had a few drinks pay them a visit because you might like it more than I did.,-1,-1
I'm confused. Why would you choose this place over all other places in Vegas? It's terrible. I had to try it because of the movie and I'm from the west coast so this was my chance but it was a lesson learned. Never coming back. Flavorless. Worst fries ever. Mystery meat? Why is the line so long? Welcome to stinktown.,-1,-1
"What's all the hype???? I will never understand.   Upon arrival to Vegas, two of my friends were so excited about this place, so we ended up going here on our second day for a late lunch. I ordered a regular combo that came with 4 burgers, fries and a drink. They were so unorganized that I ended up with someone else's food, but after standing there for 8 mins I decided to just roll with it. I actually ended up with some little tasty onion crispers instead of fries. Now, I will say that I liked them a lot, but the burgers were exactly like a Krystal burger ( no biggie, nothing major ), it looked like a Krystal & tasted like a Krystal. I later had a tummy ache. There restaurant set up is wide open, so you can see everything going in the kitchen area.    The restaurant dining area was a complete mess, I mean,  if you know you have that much traffic coming thru your restaurant, one would think you would have a clean up staff on duty at all times.   I wasn't impressed, once was enough for me.",-1,-1
"Being a self proclaimed burger expert I had been waiting to come here for ages. Last time I came to Vegas I didn't find out there was a white castle here till I had left. This time however I made a point to come here. Now I've been eating quality burgers my whole life and yes I can be a little critical at times. However when I came to white castle in Vegas I was in a very vulnerable position. I was extremely hungover, even a big Mac would have made me happier than anyone could imagine.  So I naturally got in line and asked what I should order since it was my first time at white castle. I got a very vague response that the beef was good and that the chicken was good as well. With this information I order 4 beef sliders, 2 chicken sliders, fries and a drink for a total of around $17. I got the food a short time later and was very unimpressed. For $17 back in Cali I can get some very quality burgers and great service from a well known restaurant that has locations all along the west coast, Nevada, and Texas.   These burgers were very bland and tasteless. I tried using the sauces provided and they didn't really help very much at all. The food just lacked any kick or flavor. It tasted like something that was pulled out of the frozen food section, microwaved and then given to me.   If anyone from Cali is reading this, we aren't missing out on anything by not having white castle. The east coast however y'all definitely missing out on not having in n out.",-1,-1
The worst burger I have ever had in my life. The sogginess of the burger meat and the bottom bun was repulsive. Will never go there again.,-1,-1
"Oh how Harold and Kumar failed me... So much HYPE, but so little DELICIOUSNESS. First time I came here after about 10 years since I've watch the movie so I was extremely excited. This place is extremely busy and honestly the food here is mediocre. This is good quick drunk munchie type of food, but not worth the price.  I ordered the two cheeseburgers with chicken rings and the total was about $10. It is very expensive for very little food. The thing that really bothered me was one of the rude worker. After waiting for about 15 minutes to get my food, I asked the lady what type of condiments that they served here because it was my first time here. Her response was, 'well condiment do you want.' So I replied with what are your options. She was just rude about it and for some reason wouldn't tell me. I got frustrated so I just told her to tell me the ones they have so I can choose and if you can't do that then I want one of every condiment there is to offer. She finally told me and I got what I wanted, but all this altercation was very unnecessary.   This place is pricy, has little food for what you pay for, busy, and has rude workers. No reason to ever come back here again or ever recommend people to come here. It was overly hyped due to the movie and that is the only reason this place is busy.",-1,-1
"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat while driving down the strip & our taxi guy recommended White Castle, he said its ""cheap and delicious"". We had tried the frozen microwaveable ones so we figured we'd try the real deal, only to find out they taste exactly the same. Like they just came out of the freezer and into the microwave, so we were disappointed. I also got a side of the onion chips and I was so grossed out when I bit into it and there was an onion peel inside instead of actual onion.",-1,-1
"So I'm from Texas and was in town. I've always wanted to try White Castle so I thought why not?   Got there early around 10:30. No line and for my food quickly, but that's the only positive...  Burgers were so cold my cheese wasn't even melted. Fries were old and horrible. Wish I could say better things, but for the price you really are better going somewhere else!",-1,-1
This is a great place if you want to pay for overpriced burgers which taste exactly the same as the frozen ones that you can buy at the grocery store. Save your money and go to bachi burger or a few hundred miles to the closest in-n-out.,-1,-1
"Overpriced cold burgers, your better off buying them at the store in the frozen food section. The long lines and mass produced burgers by the hundreds creates a cold burger that is not worth the price. Hopefully White Castle will open a few more in Vegas with the real menu that is not charging an arm and leg for a burger.",-1,-1
"I grew up eating White Castle in NYC since I was a toddler.  I live in Los Angeles now and when  go back to visit family in NY, I usually grab a few White Castle in The Bronx and get that great White Castle taste I grew up with.  Last week I went to this Las Vegas location and I'm sad to say I was disappointed in the food.  First of all, $3.59 for a double burger is just way over priced!  The White Castle locations I visit in NYC charge about $1.89 for a double.  I guess it being located on the strip is why the high cost?  I did notice the menu was a little different.  I don't think I saw fish sandwiches and I didn't see any fried clam strips.  And I'm fine with those menu differences.  I did like the onion sticks instead of the usual onion rings.    My biggest issue was the flavor of the burgers.  They just don't taste as good as the White Castle I'm used to.  Despite them being made fresh at this location, they still taste similar to those terrible frozen ones you buy at the supermarket.   It's too bad because I was really excited to have a location out west.",-1,-1
"Disgusting...   I'm quite the burger fanatic and review on yelp quite often. I usually stick to eating at gourmet burger joints, rather than getting the fast food type, however in Vegas I had the chance to visit White Castle, a place I've always wanted to try after watching the Harold and Kumar movies..   I was very shocked at the standard of meat being used in the burgers.. it looked inedible and made me want to feel sick at the site of it..   The cheese and onions being used looked burnt and plastic looking..   There was no sauces etc inside the burger it was plain and stale...   The prices are cheap, however I feel this place is more for those who are heavily drunk or intoxicated by other means...   I would never try White Castle again...   I'm shocked this place hasn't been shut down.",-1,-1
"Vacationing in Vegas, I got excited that i saw there was a White Castle located on the strip. For those of you who don't know, the west coast remains White Castle-less and i'm glad that it remains that way.  Unless, you've had one too many cocktails or a yard of a margarita in need of say (1-100 burgers) to satisfy your hangover needs. It tastes just like the ones available at your local Vons/Safeway Freezer section. Save your money for other delicious foods in Vegas.  While i'm sure many people dream of pursuing a ""Harold and Kumar"" type of adventure (especially because its in Vegas. So why not?) Save your money for gambling or find a better adventure.",-1,-1
This place is awful!!! Whole family got sick from eating there. What type of meat is being used???,-1,-1
0 stars barf. How can you even consider these burgers. I get the shivers every time I think about the unfortunate  time I ingested these appalling whatever they are. BARF!!!!!!!!!,-1,-1
NAAAAAAAASTY!!! BURGERS tasted like paper! We were so disappointed! could honestly say we will NEVER eat there ever again.,-1,-1
Haven't had White Castle burgers since I moved from NY. Burgers were ok but I encountered bubble guts within an hour after eating them. The taste  of these White Castle burgers isn't what I remembered. I will just buy the frozen one's next time.,-1,-1
"I don't understand what the hype is about. I ate here for the first time and I feel disgusted to have even put their food in my stomach. My group and myself felt so ill and bloated afterwards that we would all rather regurgitate the food than continue to walk around the strip with it in our stomachs. These sliders were soggy and terribly put together. The sliders you get back in middle school that were in a bag were way better than this. My fries either had the flu or were just old because they were pale and felt like rubber. If you are sober and looking for a decent meal to eat so that you can sight see, DO NOT EAT HERE! The food will make you sick. Never again. Best thing was the fountain drinks.",-1,-1
"Pretty disappointing especially since it got so much hype from Harold and Kumar, but I had to try it when I saw that they had a location in Vegas.  You can buy sliders individually without a combo meal or without getting a 10 pack. I ordered 1 slider (just to try it) and the 9 piece chicken rings. Slider was about $1.29 each (which I'm told is more expensive than their usual locations, probably because it's Vegas).  Super disappointed. The whole slider can probably be ate in 1 bite and it just melts in your mouth in a bad way. You dont even need to chew. I'm all for soft buns, like shake shack buns, but this reminded me of wonder bread, which is probably as artificial as it gets... There's also little to no patty. Chicken rings were basically flattened out pieces of chicken cut into being shapes. They were like onion rings. You also have to ask them for ketchup.  Yeah, its probably the cheapest you can get in Vegas, but its also just low quality food that you should probably just skip. Only good thing is that you get your food fast after you order.",-1,-1
Nothing special.  I wouldn't make a special trip.  Don't waist your time or your money. Maybe it's better on the east coast. Very disappointed,-1,-1
Soggy no flavor and the line is ridiculous also no where to sit down don't know what I was expecting eating sliders at the bar the other day ooh and they don't give you a refund only store credit if I'm returning my food it's because I don't like it I will not want to come back ever,-1,-1
I never knew I could hate a burger so much. It was so greasy that it soaked the bun. The meat made McDonalds look bomb. Everything about the burger was unappealing.  I had to try this place just to see what Harold and Kumar chowed down on. I literally have no idea why it couldn't have been Harold And Kumar Go To Any Other Burger Place Cause White Castle Is Nasty.  Worst $1.00 I've ever spent in my life.,-1,-1
"The first time I came to White Castle, the line was out the door.  I was excited to try the sliders!  After the first bite, I had no idea what the fuss is about.  The sliders are small and sad looking.  Not much flavor aside from the cheese.  And that's only if you get the cheeseburger sliders!  The original sliders are underwhelming.  The lines are seriously puzzling... is there a secret menu I'm not aware of?!  On the most recent, the hubs wanted to try the chicken rings.  It's a rip off. It's like a nugget, pounded super thin and then they punched a hole in the middle to make it a ""ring"".  Better off going to Shake Shack or even McDonald's dollar menu.",-1,-1
"What's the big deal about this place.  Small burger, cheap cheese and no flavor.  This hamburger is like many new Yorkes that i know.  Small, tasteless but they  think they are the #!**^.  I need in and out now.",-1,-1
"Honestly not impressed. I've heard so much hype about their food and it really was no different then the cafeteria that is at my university. also, they messed up my order. i understand that times can get busy, but when i show up and there are only 4 people in line i would hope i can get the right order. Also, I'm not sure how good i feel about eating chicken that is in the shape of a ring LOL,  something tells me chickens don't grow like that.",-1,-1
"Having been dubbed as 'gut bombers' by friends from the Midwest, I should have known better not to dive straight into the pits of hell.  Unfortunately, the term still holds true despite of being in this side of the country!  Engorged 3 sliders and things began to go downhill from there.  I'd like to keep this review as clean as possible so look up reviews on Amazon regarding sugar-free Haribo gummy bears to give you a better idea of what actually went down.  If this were your first time, consider yourself warned and eat at your own risk!  After hearing about the grueling wait in line for the past several days following its grand opening, we came in around 4 o'clock Sunday morning thinking there wouldn't be anyone in the establishment.  Instead, we walked in to one of the worst mistakes we've done in awhile.  To our surprise, the place itself was swarming with drunk people from nightclubs around the area.  It almost felt like a nightmare coming in sober; as if someone was about to get shot/stabbed at any moment.  At least you can get $1 beers from the bar right across the fast food joint to help you get acclimated with the whole scene if you happen to find yourself in the same situation.    We ended up waiting for over 50 minutes just to order and another 15 to get our food.  The sliders were just as good when I had it in Chicago.  For those having it for the first time, however, they're fairly similar from what you can get at Costco.  This might even be worse as they were rather cold once I started eating them.  Overall, White Castle is definitely bringing in the masses for their infamous sliders.  As much as I'd like not to come back at this establishment, I can see my inebriated self lining up in the near future just to get a hold of their greasy sliders to help soak up the alcohol.",-1,-1
Ummm...yeah...so I expected WAY more from this place. Considering all the hype this place gets in comparison to In N Out. The flavors were ok but the bun was so soggy and it didn't remotely taste fresh. Sadly will definitely not be coming back here again.,-1,-1
"First time having White Castle in a few years and it was a disappointment, burgers taste like the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store each tiny burgers were about over $1 in n out is way better!",-1,-1
finally tried this place out. the food is way overpriced for what you get. low quality overpriced. first time is the last time.,-1,-1
I just don't get this place.  I think it's a nostalgia thing for midwesteners but as a west coast person I don't get it.,-1,-1
"After eating this fake meat, complete with holes so u get even less, I realize that in the Midwest they must not have a lot to choose from to go on about this place. I will never go back.",-1,-1
"The vegetarian burgers are HORRIFIC. Literally horrific. It's a bun with a small veggie Pattie in it, no toppings, no sauce, no cheese, no NOTHING. We drove way too far for us to go back and ask for toppings on a burger, but who in the hell puts NOTHING on a burger!?  **Edit: I ordered one sweet chili veggie burger and one ranch veggie burger.... Neither of which had anything but bread and a veggie pattie. Also, onions and pickles are vegan and come on all of your other burgers (FYI to the business owner who wanted to mention that cheese isn't vegan, as if this somehow remedies the situation or amounts to any sad excuse for customer service)**",-1,-1
"Trash food, trash service. Ate here for the second and LAST time last week. First time was last summer. Only reason I went back was because my friend had never tried them before and he will agree when he said ""that food was pretty wack."" After waiting over 10 minutes to get our food, (which was to be expected as I learned from my first visit since they can be pretty busy at times) our fries were cold and stale. I was so hungry though that I ate my 5 sliders before going back up to the counter to tell them about the fries. The manager tells me ""you ordered almost 20 mins ago and now you tell me about the fries?...of course they're cold"". Yeah we ordered 20 minutes ago, we hadn't had our food for 20 mins. I could not believe the audacity of this idiot. I told her they were cold and stale when she gave them to us and I wasn't going to argue with a fast food employee. As a manager she should've been accommodating especially since we just spent close to $30. I told her she could keep her fries, left them on the counter, and left. White Castle food is trash and their management reflects their product. I will NEVER waste my $$ or time there again.",-1,-1
"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 54/100***  You know what they say... when in Rome, do as the Romans do. Since we were staying on the strip for a 3 day staycation we planned on finally trying White Castle and cross it off our list. Personally I have had no urge to try this popular east coast chain but the hubby was adamant in trying it at least once. Ummmm NO, not going back. Lol.   After trekking the unforgiving 110 degree Vegas heat from the Flamingo, we arrived at the very well lit White Castle space inside the Casino Royale. The area is decorated modestly and everywhere you looked was clean hence the extra star because reality is, all I can give for the quality food wise is 1 star.  We ordered 2 cheese slider combos ($8.99 each) which consisted of: 4 cheese sliders, regular size fries and a drink; Large order of the onion chips ($2.99) the buy 'em by the sack which had 10 original sliders. All that set us back $32+ after the 10% local discount they gave us. The first couple of bites were okay but it was downhill after that, I had 3 sliders and I was fighting to down it. The middle was somewhat soggy which was very unsettling, the taste is indescribable but not in a good way. The fries and onion chips have nothing going on for them either, nothing to write home about. My daughter who likes cheeseburger barely finished one, my husband had the same sentiments, after his third one he was done. My son is the only one that liked it. I told him he can come with his cousins if the mood strikes him because there is no way you can ever bring me back here, it's just not worth the calories. White Castle, check, on to the next adventure.",-1,-1
"I finally got to try this hype machine and meh is right!  I've been wanting to check out White Castle ever since I saw the first Harold and Kumar movie. After my recent visit, its clear to me that you have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy this place.  Located in the decrepit Casino Royale, this White Castle is probably the main reason people even step inside this place. WC takes up a pretty big amount of real estate in the casino but don't expect to find seating or quick service. Being the only Castle on the West Coast means this place is packed; lines are long, service is poor and its not rare to see people fighting over a seat in the dining area. If you must come here, parking at Harrahs next door or Mirage across the street should be sufficiently close.  The food here from my understanding is essentially the same as it's East Coast counter parts plus a few bucks cause you are eating on the Strip. The tiny sliders come with a paper thin slice of beef, a few grilled onions and a soggy bun due to the grease. The crinkle cut fries can be found at many other mediocre fast food spots. Skip the chicken rings and go buy some frozen nuggets from Costco, you will thank me later. The food is definitely over priced, a four slider combo with cheese runs for $9. Service was abysmal and place was a mess.  While waiting in line, the party in front of us was talking about how they grew up on White Castle in New York and how excited they were to finally eat here again. I guess nostalgia must be the only way to really appreciate White Castle. Oh and maybe after smoking a bunch of weed.",-1,-1
"White Castle is just another east coast burger joint that doesn't quite do it for me. My boyfriend and I came around 11 PM after watching a show since we knew the wait during the day would just be ridiculous. Thankfully we were right and the line was pretty short (25 mins) compared to what other people experienced. The line starts outside on the sidewalk and is pretty well manned and serviced by security guys.   On to the food. I wasn't that hungry but my boyfriend decided to ""Buy 'em by the sack"" since this is probably the last time we would be coming here unless we were super drunk and stumbled down this way again. The menu says 10 original sliders but they will put cheese on as many of them as you like which costs you a bit extra. We also got extra grilled onions (which can be added for free). The crinkle cut fries were good but don't think they were any different than ones you get from other fast food joints (just a bit more soggy). The sliders with the cheese were definitely better. They may not seem that big but you can tell you are just putting a whole load of grease down into your stomach.  Onto the aftermath of eating those sliders...man what are those things actually made of! The next morning I was soooooo gassy! So I'm not sure what those tiny little meat patties are made of or how much oil and grease is used to make the burger but man that was noooot pleasant. All in all I probably won't be coming back anytime soon, at least not sober. It's definitely a place to try just because of it's notoriety from the east coast but don't wait in line if it's over 30 minutes! You will be disappointed!",-1,-1
"What a disappointment! If you have visited the original locations in Illinois, do yourself a favor a STAY AWAY from this place. Grease-drenched, bland flavors reign supreme here, so no matter what you get you won't care for it much. The long lines, and the smoke stench that linger into the dining room from the casino floor, makes the experience really sub-par. I will wait to have another White Castle burger until I go back to the midwest.",-1,-1
I hate the fact that I have to give a star in order to do a review. The food here was absolutely disgusting! They call those burgers that was the thinnest piece of meat I have ever seen. Not only did the food taste nasty but almost made me want to throw up so I can rid myself from the horrible taste that haunted my mouth after the food that I tried to eat from there. What a Waste of money.  Not only that but it took way too long to get my food and the constant yelling of numbers made the atmosphere unbearable. First time here at this place and definitely will be my last time. You have been warned: don't ever eat here!,-1,-1
Overrated ...two stars because the line was long but they work fast and have a system... Not sure how the original White Castle taste like but the meat looks like thinly sliced mystery meat with soaked grilled onions and one pickle.... If you must try at least get the cheese slider the cheese gives some flavor.,-1,-1
"Being a west coaster all my life I was of course excited to try the infamous White Castle.  Boy was I disappointed, probably the worst fast food I've ever had. The sliders were disgusting and the chicken rings we are par with the frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets my nephew eats.",-1,-1
"This place is over hyped and not worth filling up your stomach with, and emptying out your wallet for.  Be prepared to be greeted by two security guards as you enter the front door.  Expect two to four more security guards in the tiny, cramped dining establishment.  That is not intimidating at all.    The GF and I ordered a slider and fries.  I saw them putting pickles on the slider and knew this would be a no go for her.  Sadly, the cashier had already rung us up.  It took an awkward 2-3 minutes for him to refund and re-swipe my credit card.  Sure, it is my fault for making him go through all that trouble. But, could he not have simply told the person making the sliders to not add pickles?    A minute or two after being witness to sheer incompetence, our number is called.  I guess in all the confusion, they forgot to put fries in the bag (even though I was charged for it).    Despite being the only one in line to order, I feel this place can be described as chaotic.  There were so many employees at work.  There must have been hundreds of sliders already pre-cooked and just hanging out, waiting for someone to buy them.  Freshness is definitely not a high concern amongst them.    Now on to the actual taste of the slider and fries.  The slider was nothing special.  It tastes like an exact replica of the microwavable ones.  The fries were average at best.  They taste so plain, and crispiness is word miles away from the texture of them.    Yelpers, you have been warned.  Proceed at your own risk.  If you are drunk, by all means, you will absolutely love it here.  If you have standards, please head to our friend Ronald.",-1,-1
sad to say but the microwave burgers from costco tatsted better then what i experienced here. jerome was the most rude and disrespectful person i have ever dealt with...... will never come back here..... sad over all...,-1,-1
"I've never had White Castle and when I saw it on the strip and it was close by our hotel, I decided to stop in.  The line up was long and took about 20 minutes from entering to leaving with my food.  I'm not familiar with their sliders so I decided to get 3 of them and a regular fries.  I thought if I couldn't eat them all, I would share with my husband.  The line up to order was the longest wait, but the cashier was friendly.  After I waited on the side for my order number to be called.  It seems to be an efficient process with staff doing their part of the assembly line to get the food ready and placed in bags.  The woman who calls out the number also provides ketchup packets and is friendly.  When I got back to the hotel, I was disappointed with the food.  Each slide had a pickle and onions but the beef didn't look and taste very appetizing.  I was hungry so I did eat up eating all my food but now that I've tried it once, I know I never have to go back.  There's too many other great restaurants and food to be had in Vegas so I'll keep walking by next time I'm in the area.",-1,-1
I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The food was so gross. The frozen ones are actually better then these. They have no flavor at all. After eating the first slider I started to feel sick and the 4 security guards all over the place makes it feel like we are being timed on how fast you eat so you can leave. There was no seating at all either.,-1,-1
"Grew up in CA and hadn't tried one before, and now I wish I had kept it that way. I ate two sliders and got a super super upset stomach for the next full 24 hours. It ruined a whole day of my trip. Worst part is that the food is on par with McDonalds so defs wasn't worth any aspect of the hell I went through the next day. Avoid at all costs! Go to Chipotle if you want something filling/fast and cheap.",-1,-1
"Except for the Curiosity factor this place was not satisfying. I have been to white castle in the past on the east coast they are quick, very inexpensive, and good for a snack. Worth it if you are looking for quantity rather than quality. However this place has none of that!!! Service was slow, Burgers were 3 to 4 times the price of the east coast, the place was a mess, No ice in machine, and the quality was much worse. I guess we should be lucky that we have the only white castle on the west coast but they really need to lower the prices increase the quality and get some Big Red in the soda machines.",-1,-1
"My experience at White Castle was terrible, Tammy was the worse White Castle employee I have encountered in over 20 yrs. She was mean, rude, and her customers service is the worse EVER!!! Im really considering calling you guys corporate office. But the food was great im a fan forever. Tammy needs more training guys no way she should be a manager or supervisor thx 4 listening guys. Ps the onion are fried to much",-1,-1
Made my first visit to a White Castle ever and found myself at the one on the strip. Ive had the microwave hamburgers and wanted to see if it would be any different. It was just OK. Nothing to write home about. The cheeseburger seemed really soggy and the fries were cold. It was good to try but i will try other places on the strip.,-1,-1
"OVERRATED. Wanted to try this place when they first opened but heard it was always busy. I thought, ""wow, it must be really good."" I relied on regular tv news and drunk friends instead of reviewing  yelp comments to help me decide if I was going to eat there and I paid the price. The taste of the meat was bland and the bread was like store bought buns. Really did not taste anything to make it stand out. I kept thinking I should have just gone to the store and bought the kings Hawaiian Sweet Bread and some burger meat and made my own.  I did like the loaded fries. They were tasty but the serving size was small. Bright spot, i like how security tried to keep the line moving and safe.",-1,-1
Well I been hearing that white Castle is the best and it's like in n out.... this had to be one of the worst burgers I've ever had ... I took 2 bites and to the trash it went the fries where pretty good,-1,-1
"I had a terrible experience. It started off with me enjoying the fact that I'm in Vegas and seen a White Castle. I'm from Minnesota so to see a White Castle on the West Coast was like was Christmas in July. Finally found a parking spot this is really hard to there is no parking for them White Castle that is. Made it in and see no line, no surprise because White Castle always has a line. To my surprise a young man that was in line at the front front got upset because the people that were working we're laughing and doing nothing instead of working he being frustrated hit his cup off the counter counter. That's what got my attention he started screaming that there's a line of people and the people working are laughing joking not doing anything I noticed this was true they were all in a circle just kind of hanging burgers are sitting on the waiting table ready to be made or should I just say put together cuz they're already made and we're waiting. Fred the manager who was a woman I say that because I think they gave me the wrong name of the young lady but if Fred's the name Fred's the name Fred got mad at the young man for noticing that her workers weren't working and instead of apologizing threatened to give the money back, at first he was reluctant just wanted some ketchup but when that was a chore he said yes give me my money back. I just want to say that this made everyone get hands on deck when I say everyone's hands were moving they were all moving and I don't know if it was because Fred came out or if it was because the young man made a fuss but what I know is that I got my food a little bit quicker than I would have had he had not said anything... and he didn't even get to eat. Very sad to save my hometown restaurant Kansas City Missouri where my family is from, we grew up on White Castles. Bunch of onions piled up in the corner little mustard a pickle man that bread something else. I tell a lot of people about White Castles and everybody says this or says that me I love him Frozen from Minnesota or Frozen from in the grocery store what I don't like is bad customer service and that's exactly what I got at this White Castle with Fred as the manager. It was so bad that the drinks didn't even work and the young man who only was able to get his drink had to be mad about that as well.",-1,-1
It's not good at all. You go just for the experience of having White Castle because its not local to the west coast. The experience was cool but the food is meh. I hate In-N-Out but it's superior to White Castle.,-1,-1
"Terrible burgers and fries. They taste worse than the microwavable ones. Their meat patties are disgusting, flavorless, and greasy. Not much to say because they don't offer much on their menu. Do not waste your money here.",-1,-1
"Okay, so Harold and Kumar are idiots? I don't get it? Little soggy sliders with mystery meat, a pickle and onions.... Maybe this is a midwest thing. But I just don't see the attraction. Very crowded so consider me one of the people who came to say they were there, but the food is plain and tasteless in my opinion. We ordered the combo #1 and split four sliders an order of fries and a 16 ounce soda. Total cost $8.64 and a waste of 30 minutes we can never get back... Skip this place, swing by any McDonald's in America and call it good! And by the way.... The movie wasn't good either....",-1,-1
"Where do I start Tami? Manager on duty August 7, 2016 at 2:25 pm. HAIR IN MY SLIDER?! Yummy!!! Unreal. The service by TAMI, ummmm... Training? Perhaps?! Didn't know hair was offered as a side to my burger! Thanks for making my poor daughter dig out the rest of the order from the trash to prove we weren't looking for a FREEBIE. NEVER AGAIN!!!! If they had a rating for NEGATIVE STARS, I'd be able to rate WHITE CASTLE!!! AKA ""HAIR CASTLE""!",-1,-1
"At $1.29 per slider, a totally underwhelming bite. All i tasted was a mouthful of mince meat and onions. I've tried the frozen white castle burgers back in college, and I think those were more memorable. Skip this place, and save your belly for tastier Vegas eats.",-1,-1
"Relatives from Chicago were right - definitely nothing special.  Recommend everyone try it once to satisfy your curiosity, but the burgers are terribly bland, flavorless, limp, and unexciting.   Drunk friends were not fans as well",-1,-1
"I have been waiting over 25 years to try a White Castle burger from a restaurant. I don't know if the Las Vegas location does the brand justice, and I might be talking crazy here, but I actually prefer the microwave burgers from the grocery store.   The burgers at this restuarant are much greasier, inconsistent (one of my burgers came with pickles, the other did not), and somehow lacked flavor compared to its microwave counterpart. I also tried the chicken rings-just your average chicken nugget. I don't know if it is just a western state thing, but they did offer jalapeno cheese which was a plus. For the size of the burgers, they are certainly overpriced-but I guess that's nothing new.  Because it's Vegas, they have beer on tap, but it is of the cheap variety. But then again, it is fast food after all. I will eventually give this brand another chance in the mid-west.",-1,-1
"Mediocre place, tastes like something out of the freezer, microwaved to serve. This is definitely a hype. Oh, and Be careful eating here, as me and my bf spent days being sick on the toilet. Seems like we weren't the only ones.",-1,-1
Got lucky and didn't wait long on a Saturday afternoon.  First time but not impressed at all.  Tastes like a McDonald's cheeseburger but a little tastier but with a higher price tag.  Definitely not worth the trip.,-1,-1
"I'm really disappointed with this White Castle location.  The prices here are about 20+% marked up from a normal White Castle store, and the menu is also VERY limited. Pretty much regular burger, cheese burger and chicken rings, thats it! The lines can get really long here, but it does move pretty quickly, the staff is very helpful and friendly. Ultimately, the product is lacking. Don't let this be your first/only impression of White Castle, the east coast locations are great!",-1,-1
It's White Castle....not my favorite but not bad when you're hungry. Overpriced steamed mini burgers that's all. The bread is always moist and soggy and the meat is just weird. The wait was over 20 minutes but hey it's on Las Vegas Blvd so I'm not expecting it to be quick. I'm not sure what the hype is but I'm not impressed.,-1,-1
"Never have been to this establishment ever before, I decided to give in and see what all of this hype about White Castle is all about .....  I honestly don't understand it ... You do get your order very quick and it's not expensive.... But they are just soo tiny! They taste okay, nothing that screams out go there again .....",-1,-1
"We literally had nothing better to do, so why the hell not. Got in line a little after 3pm on opening day. The line was long but very orderly, and moved consistently. Not as bad as Disneyland. The employees and volunteers were awesome. Everyone had a great attitude. It took about 40 mins to get to the front of the line, then once inside there was another small line of about 20 people deep.  Right before we got inside, they started giving out free regular sliders as samples. I seriously thought about getting out of line after the sample. The beef is literally 1/8"" thick. It's $1.09 for a plain slider, $1.50 for one with cheese. You would have to layer probably three patties to get it the same thickness of say a $1 burger at McD's.  Imagine if you ordered a $1 burger at a fast food place and got a White Castle style slider. You'd be pissed right? But people are lining up for these and buying them by the box! You can add on extra pickles or onions for no charge, otherwise there is only one pickle. No sauce either, but you can ask for ketchup, mayo, etc.  They have $5 shakes too, but no bourbon in them. They didn't even fill it to the top!  Food 1 star Value/price 1 star Service and employees 4 star Got to hang out with Nik O and say hi to Niyen 5 star Likeliness of my returning 0 star  I've never had White Castle before, and now I can say I did. I don't get what the big deal is though. In N Out hands down.",-1,-1
I'm from LA and I've never tried White Castle before. I now see that I haven't missed a thing.,-1,-1
"Disappointing. White Castle was pretty hyped up for me thanks to my friends. As I was walking the strip looking for a place to eat, I stumbled across it and decided I might as well try it. I ordered a variety of things: onion rings, chicken nugget like things and two sliders.  Onion rings, unfortunately these were the highlight of my meal....they were the best tasting thing I ordered and even then they were just okay.  The chicken nuggets tasted very stale and were pretty small too. For reference I am a fan of McD's nuggets.  The sliders were bad. They tasted like meat paste covered in onion inside a bun. I cringed while eating them and so did the friend I was with.  At least their service is nice though?",-1,-1
"Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 - 2/100  My friends and I wanted to kill some time before heading back to the hotel and getting ready for another night of clubbing, so we decided on stopping by White Castle for a food adventure.   All I can say is the burger is mediocre, the soda is flat, and even the fries are underwhelming. If I were to name one thing that I could potentially eat... it would be the chicken rings. Still tasted a little plastic-y though.",-1,-1
"I decided to go to Vegas with my friend one weekend and since i was here I decided to bring some white castle home for the family.   I was staying at the palazzo so I decided to wake up extra early at 7am on a Sunday to stand in line to get some mini burgers. I arrived and was so excited that there was no line. Not even one person in front of me. I decided to order the crave case. It came with 30 sliders for $34.99. The workers are really fast at what they are doing and got me my case of sliders super fast.   I took a bite and was really disappointed. It didn't have much flavors and the ones I have made at home were so much better than from the actually white castle.   Overall, I will not be back. Not worth it. Try it and now I will try to forget about it.",-1,-1
I was so disappointed in this place. We had the sliders for a late night snack. They were not tasty. The onion rings were better than the fries.,-1,-1
Very over priced for such a small amount of food.  No cheese sticks.  Rip off.  Go elsewhere.  Not good.,-1,-1
"I was hoping it would be White Castle, with all the things that encompasses - the burgers, the smells, the fun, the other food items, etc.   I waited till the lines were reasonable and they could get in their groove.  Well their groove wasn't so groovy.  One of the best things about their slider is how the bun melts a little into the hot burger.  For whatever reason they weren't nearly as hot as they should be.  Lost the flavor and the smell.   A $5+ dollar shake, each burger was 50 cents over regular WC's and not as good, it wasn't a place were you were eating fun for a few bucks anymore.  I'll wait till I'm back in NY for my next one.  Didn't want to be disappointed but . . .  If you're familiar with White Castle and love them, you won't want to get familiar with this one.   Keep the memory of how they were.",-1,-1
"Could you have put this in a worst location for locals. Hard to get to, middle of the strip. Virtually no parking.    Build more OFF THE STRIP.",-1,-1
"Not sure what all the HYPE about White Castle is all about. You can get a way better burger for cheaper at Shack Shake, Steak N Shake, Fatburger, or even McDonalds, if you want a late night meal, Del Taco is better than White Castle. I think people rate it in the nostalgia feeling and the memories, because it's totally not worth it.  The line did move fast and it was clean, but based on taste, no way. You're in Vegas, were you can get a gourmet burger for $6.99  (at Flemings Steakhouse)  or a decent burger at local bars for the same price.",-1,-1
"2/26- So I reached out to WC that day regarding the mistake in my order and have yet to receive a response.  Apparently customer service isn't that important when you're selling thousands of hamburgers a day.  ________  Being originally from Chicago, I've been dying to get here, but wanted to wait until the craziness died down.  I finally made it over for lunch at Noon.  Believe it or not, my wait was only about 5 minutes.  Yes, they were busy (and the line grew for lunchtime as I was there), but still not the hours it was when it opened.   It's definitely more expensive than the typical WC, but understandable both being on the Strip & delivering the food from the Midwest.  With that said, the burgers & onion ri..., er, chips are how I remembered--fantastic.  The frozen ones in the stores don't even compare.  The workers were friendly & the place clean.  However they did forget my wife's chicken rings; and considering it's overpriced & I live 15 miles away, that's an issue.  Regardless, I know I'll return when I get the crave",-1,-1
Food and speed of service gets a solid 5 stars. Manny the security guard gets a -5 stars resulting in a score of 1.  Manny should not work with customers.,-1,-1
"I've heard of White Castle and I've seen them in the freezer section at my local supermarket.   Now they've got one on the Strip.  The five of us dropped in for a snack following a show at the Venetian.    Queued up and looked at overhanging menu posted above.  Combo pack = 10 burgers, two fountain drinks, and two orders of fries could satisfy our palates.  The order taker asked if we wanted cheese.  O.k.   Total came to about $24.00.  Almost $5.00 per person for a what we got didn't seem worth it to me.  I'll pass next time.  But those are the kind of prices even for junk food in Vegas.  Mystery burger meat shaped thin and square.  The chopped onions and the pickle made up for it.  Soft burger bun.  Maybe two to four bites depending on your bite.  Served in individual cardboard boxes.  I say save money and use paper.  Need to be more eco friendly.  The kitchen was working hard.  Look over the counter and you'll see the assembly line.  And another mentally challenged person who popped himself at our table.  Talking and mumbling to himself.  First in Phoenix and now in Vegas.",-1,-1
"Food was good not as I expected to be but it's ok . Cashier was nice but Shelly ""old lady"" super rude looked at me as if I was some kind of cereal killer or something . Can't believe it I've never felt so offended in my life getting fast food",-1,-1
"Boyfriend and I were sick for 2 days. My stomach was still not right after eating here and for 2 weeks I had issues. I am finally feeling better but wow, I will never crave this place ever again.",-1,-1
"Not my cup of tea. Service was fast and friendly, but the burgers were gross maybe I'm just used to things like in n out.... This burger was terrible!",-1,-1
"Okay so a White Castle in the east coast for 60 cents a slider would have a little more appeal. But at 1.20 a slider in the west coast? No appeal what so ever. Even a hamburger at nasty McDonald's would be cheaper and more flavorful. The sliders are literally the size of a half dollar coin, and takes less than a bite to eat. Like you read in the other reviews, the meat is paper thin, our sliders had barely any grilled onions in it, and the bread was soggy. It tasted like literally paper. If it was actually the same prices of the east coast white castles then I could see the appeal in getting filled by buying like a million sliders for cheap although you're wasting it on eating a pile of flavorless junk.",-1,-1
Came here expecting to be Amazed with a White Castle burger with my gf it was freezing cold in LV but I was determined to get a White Castle burger after seeing Harry and Kulmar (movie).I walk in wait in line place my order and I wait.They call my number I rush to the counter I even ordered cheese!I sat took a bite and was so disappointed.The microwave WC burgers were better than the actual.Never will I come back in the freezing cold.Bad experience indeed.,-1,-1
"As a 12 year old boy, my friends and I were obsessed with Harold and Kumar and I mean OBSESSED. We'd watch it every single week after our Sunday league soccer games and always dreamed of going on a road trip to get 100's of those tasty looking  little sliders.  Unfortunately, that dream never did come true but 12 years later the reminiscing angels opened up the heavens and decided to let the King and Queen of White Castle land one of their castles on the Las Vegas strip!! Hallelujah right??! ....OH... HELL.... NO!   The spot is located inside the Casino Royale  Hotel, right across the street from the Mirage so it's pretty centrally located. It wasn't too busy when we went but it seems like the line goes very fast any ways. Maybe sipping on a fruity Phat Tuesday at the same time as ordering wasn't the brightest idea but either way the food here is absolutely disgusting.   I was EXTREMELY excited...remembering almost every line from Harold and Kumar as I waited for my food to be ready to grab. That excitement did a complete 180 Right after opening the bag, as it smelled like landfill or some type of sewage leak but of course I ignored it and proceeded to pull a couple regular sliders out of the bag and a chicken ring slider as well. Even though I was really hungry this stuff was so hard to swallow and digest. The sliders are almost as bad as dog food, actually I wouldn't even feed this to a poor little pup. The chicken ring sliders weren't as horrible but still tasted like dry cardboard.   I now understand why Harold and Kumar craved this place when they were high, because being high has to be the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO ENJOY THE FOOD HERE.",-1,-1
"I'm sorry Roldy and Kumar, but this crap is horrible.  I pictured this place being an east coast In N Out in slider form, but the burgers were horrible.  Love the movie, hate the product.",-1,-1
"I've heard the White Castles in the East Coast tastes a lot better and I sure hope that's the case because the sliders that I've gotten this past weekend here was not good. The lines are about 20 minutes long and the sliders were similar to the ones you get in the frozen food section.   Pretty disappointed in this place but I already expected it. The sliders looked like they were just slapped together. The only thing I liked about it was that they came in mini boxes. The meat was small and mysterious. We picked up a bag of hot cheetos to put it in our sliders to cover up the taste and it worked.   I got the Combo #2 (~$8.99) which includes 4 cheese sliders, fries and a soda. Next time I'll pass on this.   Overall, will not come back to this location. I would give White Castle another try but in the East Coast.",-1,-1
"I have been a white castle fan since birth in Chicago. I went to this location twice once on April 7th and again on April 8th. Both times I got sick after eating the double cheese burger, this never ever happens to me. The staff was very nice and the wait was short so everything should have been 5 star, but something is wrong here and I could not figure out what is was. Also it would be nice if they had security until 4am there, some of the customers are nut jobs.",-1,-1
"Wow. At least I can say I've knocked White Castle of my bucket list. Even though they make the burgers ""fresh"", I can pretty much say there isn't much difference in taste between these and the frozen ones you can get at the grocery store. The ""beef"" quality is right up there with Taco Bell's mystery beef, no bueno. A 10 pack was like $10. I had two burgers back at my hotel and didn't even finish the rest.  Thanks for the hype Harold and Kumar!! Ya'll should have went to In-N-Out!",-1,-1
"My fiance wanted to come to white castle to try the food as it was on his list of things to do before he dies due to the movie Harold and Kumar go to white castle. He thought they looked good and he did not want to try the frozen ones as he wanted the authentic experience. They were such a waste of money and calories! We got the 10 pack of hamburgers for $11, and a large fries for $2.95 which would of been the same as getting a number #1 and 2 extras for myself and come out with less food. We waited 30 minutes for our food and when we got it and ate it, we were so unsatisfied with the flavor. IT tasted just like onions, thats it! so overpowering. Will not go back! Do not suggest.",-1,-1
Had White Castle before but this one was a bit different. Me and some pals bought a 30 pack of burgers. They were tasty but two hours later all three of us sounded like a trumpet symphony!,-1,-1
"Came to Vegas for my friend's wedding and was very excited to find a white castle on the strip. Stopped on the way to the airport to bring some sliders back to Florida for my brother. My bf ran in and ordered 30 sliders to share with the family. We were highly disappointed after paying for 30 sliders to open the bag once we got on the road to find only 16 in the bag. The same great white castle taste is there, but we missed out on half of our order. I tried for over 30 minutes while waiting at the airport to contact the manager without success. I finally called the hotel to get a direct line and receieved a voice message box that was full. What a huge disappointment!",-1,-1
The burgers were a huge disappointment. I'm not sure what the hype is all about. The smell of the burger was nauseating and the meat was bland. Not sure why people like this.,-1,-1
I had high expectations for White Castle because my friend kept talking about wanting to eat here while we were planning our Vegas trip. I thought it would taste better but the sliders literally taste like the frozen ones that you can make at home. The only difference is that they add pickles. It makes me wonder if they just reheat the frozen ones and serve it. I guess this is a nice place for drunchies but I wouldn't crave for it. The meals are also pretty pricey. I'd settle for the frozen ones.,-1,-1
"Having never been to a White Castle location I had to visit this one. Umm...it was what I expected, less than average.   I really have nothing more to add.",-1,-1
"What a disappointment!  I was really looking forward to eating here...  I was first introduced to White Castle from my local freezer section when I was a child. Those little hamburger / cheeseburgers were delicious! Even as an adult now I would pick up a box from the freezer section from time to time.  So naturally I would assume freshly made would taste better than the freezer section. Sadly this was not the case. I'm not really sure how to describe it... the sliders were actually bland and soggy.  And the smell / stench... I'm not sure where it was coming from. Either the casino or the actual ""restaurant"" (the White Castle is located in the casino; open space) or a combination of both... but it was unpleasant! We quickly ate the sliders so we can get out of there as fast as we can.   Placing the order and picking up the food went very smoothly and quickly. The cashier and the lady that handed me the food was also very polite. So no complaints about that.  Absolutely skip this location and satisfy your White Castle slider cravings for your local freezer section!",-1,-1
Ugh. We literally ate raw beef yesterday and we were fine... But White Castle made us sick! Can't go anywhere because I have to be within a five feet radius of a toilet. Kind of ruined my last night in Vegas! Don't go here if you can help it.,-1,-1
"I am being generous with 2 stars. So disappointed. Growing up in NY and LI, I've had White Castle so many times and I usually enjoy it. Today, not so much. I suppose it was because I wasn't drunk. I also suppose it's when you charge me 3.19 for a double cheeseburger. So, 30 double doubles (that was for 6 people) and it cost $110, yes, ONE HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS!!!! Go F yourself! I get that it's the strip and it's going to be expensive but come on. Get real! I was extremely disappointed and won't return, even if I am drunk!",-1,-1
Not that great.  Never been there and wasn't sure what to expect but as a self proclaimed burger snob this place is more along the line of Mc Donald's.  Since I no longer eat at Mickey D's I probably would not come here again either.    Chicken was dry and the burger had too much onions on them.   However it was clean and food was hot.,-1,-1
You would do better going and getting a 16 box of the frozen White Castle burgers for $10. I'm from Detroit and it just didn't taste the same and it's over priced,-1,-1
Everyone always says it so good maybe if i was drunk id like it but it just wasnt happening for me :( i was a lil disappointed the wait was a lil long the fries were cold and had no flavor and the burgers were soggy it was too much bread :(,-1,-1
"Was told I was going there because because of the tourist attraction, not the food. They were right. The food is just ok and kinda pricy. Can get just as good of a White Castle burger at the grocery store in the frozen section. It'd be cheaper too.",-1,-1
"The absolute worst crap Ive had in a while.  Eastcoasters say its the best food they had growing up! !! You people are crazy.  This can't be life.  Avoid. You have been warned.  If you didn't grow up on this,  don't die on it.  Eat some real food.",-1,-1
"Questions: Did I eat at the same place that all the other reviewers did? How much did they get paid or how much did they smoke? Also, what was Harold thinking?  Before I go on a rant let's try to find the positives and try to write an unbiased review minus any hype. First off all the servers were incredibly friendly. The menu was easy to read basically pick a number between 1 and 100 to determine how many mini boxes you will get. Everything on the menu is colorful and photogenic.   Cliff notes Summary: 1. Equal or lesser quality to the frozen store brand 2. If your mind is telling you no but your stomach says yes. Ignore that urge to go. 3. Taste like a half star better version of McDonald's but someone cut your burger in a square and gives smaller ingredients.  4. When I was done eating my friends first reaction was Can we go now? While my reaction was can I eat somewhere else as a do over for this meal.  5. Sad face.   Warning Rant ahead...  The HYPE. First to address the hype before the review. I'm sure 99.9% of the people walking in the door watched Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. I even heard a rumor that a White Castle would be open in Hollywood to promote the movie. False. The closest White Castle to CA at that time was in Chicago but eventually a location came to Las Vegas. The only promise of enjoying a small slider in the frozen form after getting the munchies from a mind altering substance legal in some states was the only way for some people to get a taste. The idea of a fresh burger drew all of us here.  Where is the line?... I freaked out thinking... I hope this place isn't packed during lunchtime on a Friday. There was no line just 1 person taking their time ordering and other employees taking their time filling the order. The food is served in little boxes. My first temptation was to order a lot but I calm myself down and decided to start with the 4 sliders combo (2 cheese, 2 plain and fries). Visually, when I received the items it was disappointing compared to the colorful menu pictures. The slider fills about 2/3 of the box (with a 70% bun to meat ratio) and the rest is just air and paper. If only the boxes were etible I would have more food... think a kids happy meal only smaller.   The ingredients mimic McDonald's. The pickle, cheese, mustard, onions etc without lettuce or tomato. Only the slider patty is seasoned differently and the bread is like a 99 cent store roll. I can see the appeal of eating 30 boxes... I mean sliders but I rather have a 1 pound burger. Also, sliders are served everywhere in standard bar food and even Dennys is a lot better. I sure there is a disclaimer that reads only consume with alcohol and or other possibly illegal subtances.  In California, I am spoiled with the burger options and no In N out is not amazing it's the Honda Civic of burgers there good and reliable but there are better  options.  It's a good thing this place is Las Vegas. I can't speak for the rest of the country but if this is your only option I can understand the love for White Castle but if you've tried other options you will be sadly disappointed. If you want a burger you can hold in 2 hands this is not the place.   The location is not easily accessible since it faces The Strip. If you are not walking around this general area it is a bit of a walk. I don't recommend going as a fast food option on your last day when leaving  Las Vegas. I parked at Venetian and walked past so many great affordable eating places on the way to White Castle. I feel like an idiot now, after the disappointment of my lunch choice.   In conclusion, just don't do it. My mistake was I had Shake Shack the day before and I ignored my brain that warned me about the hype. Fool me once shame on me but fool my twice F U. If you are a fan do whatever floats your boat but if you are trying for the first time just don't go. There is very little room left for improvement. White Castle is for people that enjoy McDonald's but want a smaller snack with food that taste like it came from the frozen section of a grocery store.",-1,-1
"Ummmmmmm, I don't know. Way too hyped IMO. When you have In N Out or Shake Shack as other options, why would you come here? The sandwiches taste EXACTLY like their frozen ones.. Which makes me wonder.. I guess people enjoy it as drunchies but even as a drunk I didn't like it. I guess the only thing that I thought was alright were the onion rings.  Btw, the next day I was on the toilet for most of the day. Yup. Definitely not a fan.",-1,-1
"This is a big case of, ""You always want more what you can't have""  This always hold true to us West Coast folks. Especially after Harold & Kumar took a wonderful journey just to go to one of these White Castles.  Let's get down and dirty. In & Out still reigns supreme for fast food burger joints. It beats this by miles! It also beats the East Coast's Shake Shack if you look at it as a whole in terms of value/quality etc. Where Shake Shack actually serves up good quality food, despite a higher price than In & Out (In & Out serves good quality food at a great price--thus why it's hard to beat), White Castle on the other hand tastes as good as it looks--and go look at the pictures.  The burgers are tiny, and thus why they serve them in multiples when you order a combo. Usually 4 or 6 etc. They are served in those signature boxes. We just got the cheeseburgers for our first time experience. The food is a BIG BIG ""MEHHHH"".   Nothing special at all. Like I said, taste as good as it looks, and it's not much to look at.   This location is located inside the Casino Royale. It has it's own entrance from outside the strip, but it is not an isolated space of it's own. Once you go inside you will see the casino floor on the right. So if you were hoping to not be exposed to smoke, think again. The staff all seemed great though, despite being hectic opening week.  I'm just glad I got it out of the way and was able to say I've tried it.",-1,-1
Save your money and buy the frozen ones. It tastes exactly the same. DISGUSTING!   Go to McDs down the block. That's waaaaay better. I'm so disappointed. Don't know why Harold and Kumar went so far for it.,-1,-1
"The only reason I went was because of all the hype I hear about this place, and I think that is why this place was somewhat of a let down for me. I'd say try out simply to say you had White Castle. For $10 you do get full and their onion chips are pretty good, but other than that know that they are mini sliders (and sliders are already small). I guess 4 mini sliders equals an average size burger. I would suggest though when in a group of four get the 10 sliders special and split should get you through and save money when looking to be resourceful with your expenses in Vegas.",-1,-1
"food: classics. i only ordered one to try and glad i only ordered one. nothing special. it's small, but thats kind of the deal. it's not that flavorful. the buns are soft, which is good normally. in this case, it provides no texture at all to the burger and it feels mushy. ***2/5  service: for fast food, it is not fast at all. granted i am in vegas and people are everywhere. it's such a waste of resources. every burger comes in a small cardboard container. i'm no environmentalist, but even i think thats wasteful. i like how they have 100 burger bundles. that was amazing in a holy crap kind of way. ***3/5  value: i dont typically do fast food joints, but this is such a well known regional place, i had to do it. plus harold and kumar. i swear that's probably whats keeping the place in business. it's cheap and you do get what you pay for.  ***2/5",-1,-1
For as busy as White Castle is the cheeseburgers that I received or also known as sliders were not bad they were good  they were not great the French fries and the onion wedges were stale will not be going back it's not worth the hassle of the traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard,-1,-1
"Years and years ago, I remember my cousins and I dined at a White Castle in New Jersey. We ordered an entire Crave Case. We ate the entire case! I can't imagine ever doing that now. This was the first time I had White Castle since then. I was severely disappointed and it's not because I went with the veggie burger this time.   Everything was disgusting. It was a poor excuse for what they are calling a ""burger"" and ""fries"". Their onion fries were their saving grace. It was the best thing we ordered, which was at least edible. My girlfriends had the burger and neither of them finished their meals. Our order took forever because I ordered the veggie. Apparently it takes longer to make? Perhaps it's because it isn't ordered as much as the burgers?   For the 3 of us, we spent a total of $17 which included a beer. This is definitely a cheap eat, and somewhere you'd go if you were drunk and hungry. There's no other reason why you'd ""crave"" this place ever. Save your money and calories and get a real burger from Shake Shack or In n Out Burger.",-1,-1
"Not that great, but I'm sure they're awesome if you're drunk or high, that's how Harold and Kumar did it.",-1,-1
"Service was good and fast.  The food is the issue here. I grew up eating White Castle burgers. I remember getting them from the frozen food section. The burgers at the Las Vegas location taste worse than the frozen ones I've had before. The bottom bread was super soggy, meat not cooked well enough. Maybe it was the way they are cooked. I noticed they cook the meat patty with the bottom bun on top. Which makes it soggy and soaked up with meat juice. I feel this was a complete waste of money. I did not enjoy it and spent way too much for something I could have gotten at my local grocery store for less than 5 dollars.   If you want a good burger in Las Vegas go to Shake Shack or literally anywhere else. Do not spend your money here.",-1,-1
There was so much hype about this place i just had to try it so i tried the hamburger as well as the cheeseburger it was ok nothing spectacular. The wait was too long and the parking was ridiculous i don't think i would go back again.,-1,-1
"Super cheap food, not that great. Maybe if you are super drunk. Service was nothing memorable. Place is super dirty. They should definitely try to clean it. This was my first time actually going into a store front for white castle.... taste like if i was just to buy the frozen burgers from safeway =/",-1,-1
I'm more disappointed....why would I thought get fresh sliders from actually White Castle would taste better than grab it from frozen section at grocery store turn out is taste exactly the same!! The only difference is I have to go thru the traffic on the strip instead just drive to von and get one...first time and last time never again.,-1,-1
"How is this popular?  Seriously..was this some sick joke made up by East Coasters?  This is by far, the nastiest food I've ever eaten.  The burgers are soggy and the fries are straight out of the microwave. Such a letdown.",-1,-1
"My husband and I were leaving Las Vegas and he just HAD to try out White Castle.  We ordered 6 sliders and because of the hype, my expectations was pretty high.  To my disappointment, the sliders were not very good.  The onions gave me heartburn all day and I could only force one burger down.  My husband who eats anything and everything ate 2 and could not eat any more.  Tried it once and that'll be about it for me.",-1,-1
Chicken sliders were horrible...got back too the hotel and the order was wrong...not worth it.,-1,-1
"We decided to try this place since it was a short walk from our hotel. Located next to Harrah's casino, this place has several guards to ensure nobody cuts in line.   Depending on the time of day, you might encounter a line of people waiting outside.  We came here at 6 pm on a Monday evening - a short line of 5 people formed outside; when we left 45 min later, the line was around 20 people outside. Once you're inside, it's another 10-15 people. It took us about 30 min to get our food. Once you place your order, you are given a number, and once your food is ready, they call your number to pick it up. The lady would repeatedly call out the same number for a minute or two until the order was picked up. That certainly didn't add any great ambience to our dining experience.  As of 2/2/15 their menu was not quite extensive as the menu on-line. They don't have fish burgers or onion rings. We tried the original sliders, chicken ring sliders, fries, and onion chips (like onion rings but chopped up). Everything tasted like a 2/5 except for the onion chips which tasted better.",-1,-1
I love White Castle should I say I did. This White Castle has the absolute laziest workers I have ever seen. The food was not hot and the place was dirty. I asked the manager Tammy  what was going on here. She had no idea! To the Ingram family if you would like an update let me know.,-1,-1
This place is horrible. The. Quality of the food is crap. Might as well go buy the frozen ones and microwave them yourself cuz that's what they taste like. It was a very disgusting meal. Don't believe the hype around this place .,-1,-1
"""Don't believe the hype!"" LOL If you're looking for a fast drunk fix then by all means enjoy these bad boys..  Pros: Super soft bread and full of cheese. Cons: meat was similar to Mc Donalds just overwhelming with dehydrated onion flavor.    I also ordered the fried onion peels which were a tad old and the breading was too crispy.. not my fav.   Overall I suggest spending the 10 bux and give them a try,  You might like them! As for me.. FATBURGER for life! LOL",-1,-1
"I love White Castle!!  But this location is too crowded and too hard to get to.  Please build a few stand-alone locations for us locals!!!   I parked at the Venetian and walked over to White Castle (it's in front of the Casino Royale) and I wouldn't recommend it...there's a small alleyway with a sign that says ""Casino Royale Best Western Entrace"" inbetween the Casino Royale and the Venetian and I will try that if I ever go back.  The wait was not too bad.  There were like 3 sloppy security guards inside...dirty, uniforms didn't fit, bad weaves, etc.   They shorted me 1 slider.  All 4 people who ate them got diarrhea.  TMI?",-1,-1
"OK.  I've been waiting to find a white castle somewhere near San diego.  I come to vegas for a conference and walking along the strip I see white castle!!!  OMG.  I was so excited I texted my wife (who stayed home with the kids :-(   ).   I'm a burger guy, and having tasted this, I'm really disappointed in the taste.  There is hardly any meat and mostly carbs.  The mean is like deli sliced beef.  The service is fast and the price is pretty affordable.   But you get what you pay for.  Micky D all they way still.",-1,-1
"Not as great as how Harold and Kumar made it look. Line was long and after getting the food (It was packaged very nicely) and tasting it for the first time I probably would not go out of my way for White Castle. Food wise I was disappointed, but what was even more disappointing were the workers. They're rude and have extremely bad attitude. If you don't want to give us some extra ketchup why not just leave it out for people to grab then...geez",-1,-1
Omg these sliders are crap. Being from the East coast Northern va area I have never tried these so when they came here everyone said it was a must try. Disgusting!  I took one bit and that was it. I don't know why everyone raved about this place.,-1,-1
"After trying this place for the first time, I was not impressed. The burgers were not that tasty and the fries were limp and not crunchy. They handled the crowd decently enough and had plenty of employees on hand.  I wish my experience was better. I won't return. I'm not sure what people back east see in this place, cause I sure don't see it.  Other than my experience, if you like the food then they did just fine on all other points.",-1,-1
"Came here for the first time after the club. I was interested in going to this place after I watched itsjudytime's (Youtuber) husband, Benji raved about it when him and Judy came to Vegas.  To be honest, it's not worth the hype. People say this place is pretty bomb since it's an East Coast branch but it was all right.  The portion is super small so you def have to get some more items if you're hungry. I got the regular sandwich (with buns and sausage link pattie) and loaded fries. The loaded fries tasted much better because it had a nacho cheese sauce with bacon.   Other than that, if you're into trying something new. But I would pass! Oh well!",-1,-1
I had never been to White Castle before and I was excited to try them for the first time. Seating was awful and so was the food. What was I thinking. I don't even think I could stomach them on a drunk stomach.,-1,-1
"I'd been looking forward to this place! My neighbor said how good the East Coast WC is. The Las Vegas WC is not so good. So, we ordered, food came quick, and I was really disappointed. It tasted like meatloaf burgers. Maybe I'm just not a fan of tiny sliders. The other issue I have is the amount of trash that is produced. My son just tried the microwave ones and said that they were at lot better that the one we had fresh!",-1,-1
"I wouldn't recommend it. I was so excited to eat after watching the Harold and Kumar movie. I had been told not to expect much from White Castle from my friends, but even setting a low bar I was dissapointed. I ordered the #2 meal, which is a drink, fries, and 4 cheese sliders for $9.72. First mistake: I didn't realize the sliders come with pickles and onions. It was my fault, although they were not pictured or described on the menu. I was starving, so I brushed the undesired condiments off my sliders. Sadly, I only made it through 3 sliders before my stomach started to hurt. I feel a little sick. so I decided to toss the last slider and call it a night.",-1,-1
"These sliders are really good for DRUNK MUNCHIES.  Here you have dehydrated onions that are soaked the thrown onto a hot flat top grill.  From here they put on the meat patties, which in turn get STEAMED instead of developing a nice brown crust...   You're basically eating an entirely steamed slider that is extremely bland.  The bread was so soggy that it was falling apart.  The meat itself felt like mush and the onions would have been better if they were caramelized.  Not a fan of this place at all.  OVERALL:  I would definitely recommend anyone to try this just to be aware of what is offered, but I just don't see myself coming back unless I'm walking around the strip late at night drunk and have the munchies.",-1,-1
We were only excited about this place because of Harold and kumar and were extremely let down. The fries were soggy and unflavored. The burgers were also mediocre.,-1,-1
"Having grown up in NYC and I can remember when the burgers were 8 cents, I remember being so excited when White Castle started selling frozen sliders in Costco and then grocery stores.  I personally think the frozen ones are better than the ones I had yesterday from the new location on the strip.  At 2AM we still waited at least 15 minutes.  All we ordered were regular burgers.  You could see they were rushing to complete orders and voila when we got our 8 sliders they were not very good.  3 of 8 had no pickles (we did not order them that way) and on all of them the onions were still mostly raw and overpowering.  Overall, based on the visit, I will not return.  Considering the frozen ones cost abo.ut 50 cents each from Costco or when they are on sale at the grocery store, why go to the strip to pay double for an iconic slider that didn't taste all that great with mostly raw and overpowering onions.  This is a post script:  I just came home from Sam's Club where I purchased 18 White Castle Cheeseburgers for about $11 and they are way better than the sliders we got on the strip a few weeks ago.",-1,-1
Some of the worst management ever. We had a problem with our food and she acted like she didn't care. Doesn't take business seriously. The manager we dealt with was named Barbra Jean. I won't be returning to this restaurant again.,-1,-1
Rude staff and super dirty place... go to beni Hana down the street,-1,-1
"I was very into this store, I even ordered 250 $ of fried chicken here for my birthday party. But today my friends go there and ordered sweet and sour chicken, the owner made spicy fried chicken, so they ask for a change. The owner just refuse they made a mistake and keep saying this is what they ordered. I understand that they don't want to waste money to make another dish, but the service attitude is really disappointing. Will not go there anymore. Plus, the portion is pretty small, and taste not that good. I suggest Mon Ami and Dawa, they might be a little far, but the portion is much bigger.",-1,-1
The service was really bad and disrespectful. Forcing the customers to order as per the need of their business was not an appreciable attitude.,-1,-1
"Great chicken, terrible service. Waited more than an hour for delivery, had to call back many times to confirm if the deliveryman was on the way. When he arrived, very unprofessional. Did not know how much change to give, and was pulling it out of a wallet as if he was fumbling to give change to a homeless person. He even had the nerve to brashly ask me,  'So how much tip will you give me?' I gave him a tip so that I didn't have to deal with him anymore. Food was colder than the service.",-1,-1
"We ordered the marinated chicken (yang nyum chicken) with chicken and green onions (pa-dak) via phone. The lady I spoke to was very calm and was very sweet sounding. She told us it would take 30 minutes to arrive. Usually it takes about 50 minutes according to my brother so I was hopeful.  Nope.   I heard a knock about 15 minutes past an hour. Not impressed at all, I handed the guy the money from my wallet, and as I was reaching into my pocket to give him change for the complete 12% tip (btw, the lowest I tip is 10% for the slow/rude people), he looks at me and tells me ""uhh people usually tip 10%.""   ...............  So I fished out the rest of the money, and even after I gave him a 12% tip, he left grudgingly. If you're an 45 minutes late from the expected time, and 30 minutes late from the usual time, and you didn't even bother calling us, you can't really expect a good tip... At least in my book.  With two cokes, minus the tip, the total was about $62, which is hella expensive. My brother and I finished it and were content, but we definitely could have made three times the amount with $30, marinade and all.  Overall, the place is good for cravings, but I certainly don't want to order from here often otherwise my wallet will be lighter and my conscience will be heavier.",-1,-1
"I tried this place out after discovering it was so close to the hotel I was staying in. My group of three ordered take out - half fried and half spicy marinated chicken to share. First, for the price, I thought the portion size was on the small side. Given that the walk from the restaurant to the hotel was maybe five minutes, I expected the chicken to still be crisp. The fry batter was far from crispy - even for just the fried chicken. The spicy chicken was not spicy at all and the sauce overall tasted more like ketchup than anything else. I was looking forward to having some decent Korean fried chicken but was disappointed.",-1,-1
Just had lunch at this establishment. Very friendly service. I got General Tso chicken. Supposed to be spicy but it was rather bland with no spice. Chicken was over fried as it was tough and dry. Fried rice was good but egg roll was evidently old because it was chewy rather than crisp. Likely won't be back which stinks because they are so close.,-1,-1
"Just wasn't what I thought it would be.    Maybe it was just a bad day or maybe I selected the wrong entrÃ©e but unfortunately I did not like the food at AJK Chinese Cusine . The entrÃ©e's just weren't what I thought they would be.  The sesame chicken that we ordered was completely bland, the mongolian beef did not seem fresh, and the lo mein and fried rice were greasy and lacked any taste.   I honestly think you can get same or better quality food at Panda Express.",-1,-1
This is the worst Chinese food I've ever had. We got the dinner for 3 but everything we had was lacking flavor and they were the chefs selections.,-1,-1
"I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants, and this one was not impressive. They were cold but business friendly.  I asked about an ingredient and they would not add it for an extra cost.  Crab Rangoon is called a ""cheese puff"" and were ok.  Most of the food lacked seasoning and I felt they were skimpy on ingredients.  Finally, when ever I have ordered a meal with fried rice, it at least had vegetables. So I was disappointed to open my meal and find plain fried rice.  I didn't really feel that there was much heart in the cooking. I will not be revisiting this place. Too bad because its nice inside and clean.",-1,-1
"I was starving late one night. First problem, never make food choices when you're hungry - plan ahead. So I'm searching for anything that is open and I try this place out. Quick and easy - never again.   First mapquest sends me in the wrong direction, then when I call for help the server tells me it's across from Lowe's? It would be clearer to say it's across from Walmart!   I ordered Cheese Puffs (I should have known to change my order when I asked if the cheese puffs were wontons or rangoon and the lady on the phone said ""no cheese puffs""). I half accepted some deep fried Chetto. But this was actually the only enjoyable part of the meal. Honey Sesame Shrimp was over cooked with little taste. It was suppose to come with shrimp fried rice but instead I was given tasteless brown rice and a vegetable spring roll that I never tried because the rest of the meal was so disappointing.   This is in no way authentic and I bases on my experience it was barely good on a Sunday night. But maybe that's because I forgot to pray over it since I was so hungry. Only Pro: it helped me stay on my diet.",-1,-1
"Was not impressed.  We ordered take out and got their family meal ... something like 3 dishes with rice, noodles and egg rolls for around $35.  Great deal and a LOT of food but it did not taste good.  They put way too much corn starch to thicken the sauce (which is normal but the over did it) and the broccoli was waaaay too soggy.  Our egg rolls were over cooked or the oil wasn't clean b'c they were way too dark and had like burnt spots.  Mapo tofu wasn't bad.  I asked for non-spicy and they cooked it as requested.  Broccoli beef was terrible - the broccoli was way too soft (and I actually don't mind soft broccoli but seriously, this went overboard) and like I said, too much cornstarch.  I thought the sweet and sour pork wasn't bad but apparently the hubby didn't like it.  Go figure 'cuz I'm the Asian one inthe relationship!  Places like these, I definitely think you need to try for yourself b'c our tastebuds are so different but coming from somebody who knows Chinese food, I wasn't impressed the least bit ... except for the quantity ... very generous portion!",-1,-1
"We were there on a Saturday late afternoon.  Including us, there were only 6 customers.  The service was pretty quick (3 different servers), they all helped out each other.    Ok, here is the food comments:    Thai Satay Chicken Skewers - they were dry, tough, and not grilled (I think it was fried).  The peanut sauce that they were covered in was not peanutty enough.    BBQ Pork Slices - the flavor was good and a little greasy, but the slices were inconsistent.  You get super thin slices and they normal slices.  Beef Egg Foo Young - The beef and gravy was ok but the veggie egg platters a little on the burnt side.    We overhead the couple on the other side of us complain about their food.  So, I am not sure if it was an off day or this was their normal quality of food.  I would good back to Ono Hawaiian (fast food) which is cross the parking lot next time I feel Asian.",-1,-1
"This restaurant does not exist at the stated location.  I used GPS Navigation and everything, but there is nothing there but old houses.",-1,-1
"They messed up my order.  Then you have to explain over and over again what they did wrong.  And to top it up, they offend you and call you a liar.  Apparently they can't do wrong.  The worst service ever!",-1,-1
"I love Ramen, but this place wasn't anything particularly special. The price is right, the place is clean and the servers were nice. When it comes right down to the food though, I wouldn't recommend it any more readily than other options for a good soup in the area.",-1,-1
"I really have never paid so much for a bowl of noodles!!  2 bowls of noodles and an appetizer for $45!  I could've gone to an all you can eat restaurant for that price! And u wasn't very impressed with my noodles. There wasn't much to it. Some noodles, some ground pork, some extremely salty broth......  It was suppose to be spicy but was far from it.  The takoyaki balls were pretty good though......hence the two stars!",-1,-1
"It is opened by Chinese people so technically it is Chinese way of Ramen...so, having a semi-cooked noodle is not a surprise...I left half of the bowl there...and those 2 stars are for the dumpling, which is fully cooked....if I have to give its ramen a star, I would give a -2! Go there for dumpling or DanDan noodle if you are really out of options, but not Ramen...",-1,-1
#detox ...... will not go again  Takoyaki tasted nice..  but something is wrong with the pork in ramen..,-1,-1
The king ramen had a lot of stuff and delicious but too spicy for my taste.  Couldn't enjoy the noodles due to this. The rest of the menu didn't seem very appetizing and the yaki soba was too sweet.  More fast food tasting.,-1,-1
The food isn't bad.   Unfortunately the service is just not there.   Rushed out of dinner and wouldn't even take dessert order when there are still other to let there.   Not to mention I told the waiter when I started. Probably won't go back.,-1,-1
It's good salty Ramen but as a meal you should order 2 bowls because its basically all noodles and very little meat or veggies.  There is so much salt that I taste it in my mouth for the rest of the day.,-1,-1
"THE KING is a great soup.. Dundas location is SUPERIOR...  The decor/setting.  Yonge location had really bad dancey/pop music playing, way way too loud and completely ODD for the environment, completely annoying.  In the end a one time visit.  Stick to the BLOOR or DUNDAS spots.  simply better...",-1,-1
"I'm a huge ramen fan and I was disappointed when I went to Kenzo yesterday.   I had the Kings of King Ramen with a spicy level 2/3. It was really spicy though I'm Chinese and can take a quite a lot of hotness. Moreover, mushrooms and meat in the soup tasted smoky, not in a good way. They tasted like they were over cooked and the fire was way too hot for them.   Overall, I don't think I will ever go back there.",-1,-1
"Geez! Where to start with the headaches!!  I would give this place of business a HALF STAR!!!!!!    This place is soooo un-organized and the employees are soooo rude that I still can't believe they are still in business!!! I ordered my bridal dress in January of 2010 they told me I would get it by March, March comes around then they said May, then they said finally will get it by June. My dress came extremely wrinkled and when I wanted to try it on none of they employees bothered to help me out!! They just pointed to where the fitting rooms were. On top of that as I was paying for the remainder they wanted to charge me an additional charge for the custom bag to protect the dress!! Also, the place a business had an auction for wedding stuff and the bids were super cheap but as we were ready to check out they charged $30 each item for shipping tax!!! and they would not ship to your home only to the business. SUCH A RIP OFF!!!!! In addition to that, I called a month later to check on my order, they said my purchases were not ready yet, MONTH 2 I CALL AGAIN STILL NOT READY!!! MONTH 3 TWO ITEMS WERE READY. MONTH 4 THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING WAS THERE I SHOW UP, STILL NO RING PILLOW OR FLOWER BASKET!!!!  MONTH 5 FINALLY WALK IN EXPECTING TO YELL AND ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK, WHAT A SURPRISE MY STUFF WAS THERE ALL DUSTY!!! THIS PLACE IS RIDICULOUS!!! AND THE OWNER IS EXTREMELY RUDE MONEY HUNGRY BEEEP!! I RANK THIS PLACE 1/2 STAR!!!",-1,-1
"Terrible Customer Service! This store has a completely incompetent staff including the manager Rebecca. I took notes of all of my dealings with them specifically so that I could write this review. I called 12 times in March and April of 2011 and was always put on hold for over 10 minutes. I left messages for Rebecca or Anna (who sold me my dress) to call me back since everyone I got on the phone (usually Cherish) was unable to tell me where my dress was, when it would be shipped, when it would arrive, or how to put a rush (which I said I would pay for) on the dress. No one ever called me back. Three times I was given information (that my dress was shipped when a week later they said that it had not shipped etc.) that turned out to be false. They are no better in person, but rude, unapologetic, and almost unbelievably incompetent.",-1,-1
"I don't know how these people are still open.  I wish I would have done my research.  I'll try and keep it short bc there are PLENTY of bad reviews already on here: Ordered my dress in January and paid in full that day.  Was promised my dress in May for my July 31st wedding.  No word from the salon throughout May and into first week of June.  Called 1st week of June.  Left message - no return call.  3 days later called again.  Girl said ""dress has shipped, should be here any day.""  TWO more WEEKS go by with no word from salon.  Begin calling again - everyday.  No answer.  No answering machine.  Finally drive down there.  Girl (owner's daughter) tell me the dress has yet to be shipped bc the manager hasn't called the manufacturer to ""have the dress released.""  Why did they tell me it had been shipped 2 weeks ago when it hadn't?  Why hadn't it been released when it was promised in May?  More weeks of this back and forth go by.  NEVER receiving a call from the place.  I finally called them July 1st (wedding is in 3 weeks at this point) and it had arrived.  I drove down to pick it up.  They didn't offer a single solitary apology nor any amends for the tardiness of the dress or lack of professionalism and lack of communication.  They offered nothing.  Even tried to send the gown home with me without a bag ""because they were out of bags.""  I made them give me a bag from one of the dresses on the rack.  I hope these reviews save others from the displeasure of working with this horrific business.  I'm afraid the owners really do deserve to go out of business.",-1,-1
"My fiancee ordered her wedding dress in February, paid half up-front and was told it would be ready by July. It has now been seven months, and they still don't know where it is.  The only answer they can give us is ""I'll call the manufacturer"".  This is easily the worst customer service I've ever had in dealing with a retailer.",-1,-1
"If I could rate this store a zero I absolutely would. Hands down the worst experience with a bridal shop I have ever encountered! DO NOT USE THEM if you value honesty and accurate results.  I ordered my bridesmaid dress on February 20th which was a Sunday, so I was instructed to call them back on Monday so that they could contact the designer for timeframes. I called on Monday and was told that the dress would not be in until the first week in May if I did not put a rush on it, so I told them that I would need the rush because the wedding is out of town on May 16th, They said they woud add to my order and that my dress would be in the first week in April.  I did not hear from them the first week in April, so I placed my first of many calls to them on 4/12. I was told that the dress had not come in yet, but that they would call the manufacturer and call me back; no one called.  I called again on 4/13 and they said that the dress would ship the following Monday and would be in by the end of the next week (4/21-22) and they would call when it came in.  I called again on 4/25 because I had not heard back YET AGAIN and they said that it didn't come over the weekend, but that it would be in the afternoon shipment and would call when they got it.  AGAIN no call back, so called again on 4/26 not in said they would call manufactuerer and call back. Nothing. Called again 4/27 spoke to Cherish - no one ever contacted the manuf. would call me back. by noon, but didn't get a call so called again and they said it was shipping, but they were not allowed to release tracking numbers, so I asked to speak to manager (Rebecca) who was ""out running errands and would call me back"", but never did.  This same back and forth went on until Saturday 4/30 when I finally had to have my husband take over the phone calls because they said that my dress had been delivered to a PUB in Tempe somewhere and they couldn't find it.   They finally found it that afternoon and I had the bride go get it for me for fear of what they would do with it if given the opportunity. Laughably, they still asked if I wanted to schedule and alterations appointment...FAT CHANCE!",-1,-1
"I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS!!!! I wish my two bridesmaids who went here would have done their research because this has been a nightmare!!!! First off the dresses were ordered nearly 9 weeks ago and 3 weeks ago my bridesmaids were told the dresses were ""lost"" they kept blaming Alfred Angelo even though Alfred Angelo said the dresses were already shipped. So for 3 weeks after going back and forth with the dumb manager and whoever else works there my fiance had to take over and forced the owner to give him the UPS tracking number... after looking at the activity with the tracking number it turns out the dresses were NOT lost but had been attempted to be delivered 3 different times but every time they tried to deliver them the store did not have the payment for the delivery even though the dresses were paid in full already!! I am so angry and so confused as to how a company can function and stay open like this! They are so unhelpful and rude! Supposedly tonight the manager is going to the UPS hub to pick up the dresses so my bridesmaids can pick them up tomorrow.. with my wedding less than 3 weeks away I sure hope this is true! I will believe it when I see it. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",-1,-1
"A one-star rating for this business is generous. The staff are rude, flippant, immature, and obnoxious. The manager is never in the store, but you will be placed on hold for 30 minutes and speak to 3 different people before you are informed of this. Don't bother requesting that the manager be called, too, because she flat out refuses to speak to her customers. No assistance is provided in the dressing rooms, no organization is evident behind the counter (beware your credit card receipts!), and no dress ever arrives in a timely manner.  Repeating other reviewers' concerns, that this business is still up and running is shameful.",-1,-1
"Really glad Yelp is smart enough to filter out the 5 star reviews. If you notice, the exact same people, with the exact same 5 star reviews posted them EVERYWHERE they possibly could.   This place is quite possibly the biggest joke of a business I have ever encountered. My best friend ""bought"" her dress there. I'm not going to bother typing out how horrid our experience was, but I will say it was RIGHT ON PAR with what everyone else has written.   Do yourself a favor, just don't do it. Ever.",-1,-1
"This place doesn't need another bad review but I am giving them one because it's worth it to me to write this all out. I am an MOH to my best friend and we just had the WORST afternoon with these people, essentially the most horrific bridal situation.  My best friend (the bride) bought her gown at the Phoenix Bridal Convention back in January through this bridal shop. The sales people were pushy the day of the convention but my friend loved her dress so much, and the price was right, so we over-looked it. The bride's mom put down half of the $$ for the dress, and they charged her credit card the wrong amount.  They were supposed to call the bride when the dress came in the first week of May, and she didn't hear from them. She basically had to call every week to finally get an answer that the dress was in the shop, and to schedule her first alterations session with their seamstress.  We show up this afternoon, the bride came in from Flagstaf, the MOB came in from Colorado for this fitting. We get there and first they cannot find her dress, of course we are panicking right away. Then they find the dress, and for some reason mixed up her appointment and thought it was at 4pm rather than 1pm, so the seamstress was not in the shop and wasn't available in the afternoon to come in. This place contracts out seamstresses, they do not have an in-house seamstress - and this was NOT made clear to the bride when she made the alterations appointment. When we asked if they could call in another seamstress, they couldn't find their contacts and didn't even understand when we asked ""how does your seamstress contracting work"" - they had no answer because they didn't even understand what that meant.  Finally we decide we are going to take the dress elsewhere to get altered because the bride at this point doesn't trust this place, and wanted to get out ASAP. She got a free veil and tiara at the convention when she bought her dress, so we needed to get those items from the store and then we were going to leave. It took them an HOUR to figure out what veil and tiara she had pre-ordered, people would say they were helping us, then walk away. Essentially the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  We walked out with the bride in tears, the mother extremely angry, but at least we had the dress and no longer need to deal with these people. Long story short - DO NOT order your bridal items from this store, they are disorganized, it was disgustingly dirty in the shop, and they will rip you off without even knowing it.",-1,-1
This Russian/ Turkish/ restaurant/night club or whatever it was is a disaster! It is a shame because the food is really good. The servers were HORRIBLE and it turned out to be a very disappointing evening for my family. We were never even offered drinks the entire evening!  We had to beg for water and menus.  The appetizers eventually made their way out of the kitchen after the meals arrived.  Our server quit half way during our dinner!  The owners really need to figure out the restaurant's identity and get their act together if they want to make it.  I feel bad about writing this review because the chef (former chef of Ceder Center Anatola) is excellent.  :(,-1,-1
"Went there at 5:30 on a Wednesday to find the place locked up, despite the website hours saying it would be open.  No signs or anything to indicate why it was closed, and phone calls went to voicemail, very disappointed",-1,-1
Bland overcooked overpriced..   The overall 3 rating is too generous.  I should have checked first before I wandered into this dump.,-1,-1
This was a sad experience.   The entry is nicely painted staircase with lively graffitti.  The inside looks cozy with exposed brick walls and wine bottles with dripping candles to add to the ambiance.  We asked to eat on the terrace.  That was probably our mistake.   The waitress didn't came back after we said we needed a minute.  The guy waiting on us seemed to be the chef.   The food took a while to come out and then was bland and cold.   It was pretty though.  Just wish it tasted as good as it looked.,-1,-1
"Horrendous. Truly wolf dressed as lamb. The decor and layout were deceptively nice, but please do not waste your bills on this place. Our waiter was surly and only attempted a pleasantry when bringing the bill. The food was standard if not completely appalling (some had a brown salad, others had meh 15 pound lamb, and I had bland mushroom pasta that left me in the bathroom for a good part of the night). Plenty of other places in this fair city.",-1,-1
"Maxies doesn't look much from the outside, and to be honest, it isn't up to all that much inside either. Situated just round the corner from the Royal Mile, Maxies is right behind Edinburgh Castle and so it ought to be a great restaurant for all the tourists to go, but unfortunately it is not up to much.  The restaurant has quite a cosy feel inside with padded seats covered in cushions, with a pretty lively atmosphere. The menu in Maxies is pretty much seafood orientated, with lots of fish and seafood dishes, but there are also steaks, stir fry's, chicken and haggis dishes on the menu too. I had the sole cooked in a creamy sauce, which was OK. The sauce was pretty thick and gloopy and lacked proper taste, but the fish was perfectly cooked. My friend had a pasta dish which they really didn't like, she said the pasta was still hard and that the sauce was tepid - not nice. The service was pretty average too, the waiter's weren't that attentive and only seemed to show some life when we asked for the bill.   There are much better restaurants in Edinburgh which are more deserving of the custom than Maxies.",-1,-1
"i hate to give them a bad review because our waiter was so nice....but, my allegiance to the YELP community must persevere!   This was a crappy restaurant. But, it was walking distance from our apartment and my mother-in-law wanted something close. Arghhhh.  The drinks were warm (yes, I know I'm in Scotland....but, I'm from the US where we serve cold drinks) and the food was mediocre. Had the shrimp stir fry and it was pretty bland. The only good thing was the price and the nice waiter.   Don't waste your money. I lost my pounds so you don't have to.",-1,-1
"We saw the sign that mentions they have good fish and chips cooked to order so we thought why not try some classic uk fish and chips like we hear about on television.  The batter was not salted or seasoned so there was zero flavour, the fish they used had no flavour to speak of.  The temp on the fryer must have been too low because the batter was very greasy and it soaked right through into the fish as well.  Maybe they are famous for something else but they have no business selling fish and chips",-1,-1
"Good location, nice decor, nice staff, terrible food. I ate here recently and was decidedly disappointed; from the menu it looked as though the food would be lovely. I had smoked salmon and cream cheese pate which was much more cheese than pate, then a very interesting take on enchiladas which unfortunately was the kind of standard I'd expect in McDonalds. My boyfriend had duck and orange pate which was horrible; he only ate half of it. He then had steak, which he said was nice but the crevettes it came with were mushy and very over-cooked, and the mashed potato with was dry and crumbly - he said it reminded him of the sort of potato you'd get at school. He thought it'd had all been left under a heat lamp as it was so dry. We were discussing how it had been so busy and the only conclusion that we came to was that it's in a tourist trap. I don't think this place gets a lot of repeat business.   My advice if you're looking for somewhere nice for dinner in this area is to go to Maison Bleue on Victoria St, or The Outsider on George IV Bridge.",-1,-1
"yes 2 stars. Fries were cold and hard, and burger seemed EHH.  I dont have these where I live so I was excited to get one. They did give my dog a patty which I thought was cool. BUT the fries killed it for me and the burger just seemed off.",-1,-1
Check your order before you dive away or you'll get a bag of fries and a bag of fries.  No burgers. Serious?!,-1,-1
Black shoe leather. Worst burger ever. Don't use the drive up as they will dump their rejects on you.,-1,-1
Where to start.  Ugh.  Spent $30 to feed my family.  Asked for no tomatoes and they put two big fat hearty slices.  Nasty.  Pulled them out for of course it left that nasty seeded snail trail.  Yuck but I can deal.  Then my son.  Eating his 4x4 and get to almost the last bite and finds a bug in it.   It looked like possibly a large mosquito.  Not sure.   It was some large winged thing.  I took it in and pointed it out to the lady at the register and she thoroughly examined it like I was a liar trying to get out of it or something.   They replaced it about 15 minutes later.  Just an overall bad experience.  This is a very fast paced in n out so I try to look past the dirty tables and full trash.  But bugs? Can't let that slide.,-1,-1
"SLOW service. I've been to other In-N-Outs before, and while I'm not the biggest fan of their food, they at least get it out in a timely manner. This location doesn't seem to do the same.",-1,-1
this is the third time I've ordered drive thru from this location asking specifically for a double double hamburger and they have given me a cheeseburger. most definitely my last straw,-1,-1
"Nothing special, IMO. I visited to experience something new, as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok, not bad or the best tasting burger. The fries were fresh and not too salty, they tasted like potato chips. The restaurant was busy, but the service was prompt.  This was worth trying once.",-1,-1
"This must be my 43rd different location of in-n-out, so I consider myself an aficionado. I got double the salt on my double double. But seriously folks, I will not be doubling back to this location. In and staying Out!",-1,-1
This place is super overrated. I wasn't sure if I was eating a burger or a jar of salt,-1,-1
"I've never been to an In-N-Out, I've only seen instagram pics and etc so since I was starving and wanted some fries and decided to expand my beef taste buds (I don't eat beef,but when I do it's only Taco Bell and Five guys) so I went through the drive through since inside was packed. I got my meal and sat in my car and ate thinking with such amazing great reviews I'd have the same experience, but no.   When I got my food it smelled like fish, the fries were okay, not what I was expecting and the burger was okay. The only good thing about the food was you can taste how fresh the lettuce and tomatoes. Also the girl at the drive through was nice, that's about as all the good things I can say. I'm so disappointed, I was really wanting an awesome meal since I didn't feel like driving to a restaurant in old Scottsdale and waiting for my food and being even more hungry. Either way I will not eat In-N-Out ever again, just not my cup of tea lol. I only give two stars to places I will never eat again.",-1,-1
"Let me be clear, you come here for the music and vibe--not the food or service. Casual drinks or a date its a great spot. However, if you are planning on having dinner this is not the place. Very few waitstaff so the service is slow, even when they are around they are not attentive. Who brings over two waters for a table of four? food is typical bar fare and it is mediocre at best. If this place didnt have live music I really couldnt see a reason to come here unless i was desperate for a pint.",-1,-1
"I am super surprised to be one of the very few 2 star reviews for this place...  As a place to grab drinks and listen to live music, I'd be willing to give this place a 3 star but the food and atmosphere were not the best.  I ordered the cheese Quesadillas (a commonly known safe bar food option in my opinion). It was very small for $9 price tag that came with it (three pieces) and every ingredient tasted like it came from a can (think pizza pocket!)  My friends ordered the garlic bread with cheese and the wings and again both of them said they were surprised about how bland the taste was.  My recommendation is eat before or after coming here and just come for the band....",-1,-1
"Food was mediocre at best, not to mention far too pricey. I had ordered the burger with a side of fries and a drink, but instead received a salad instead of fries. When inquiring about the mix up, I was told ""You happy? No? You eat salad"". After being ignored for the next 20 minutes and subsequently eating the salad I was served, I finally managed to convince the owner to give me my plate of fries. The service was excruciatingly slow, though the supposed "" jazz"" (a single piano) was okay.   Overall I give this restaurant bar a rating of 2 stars, since I did eventually receive my fries.",-1,-1
Very disappointed in this place. Food was incredibly bad and way too expensive for the quality we got. Definitely not going back again.,-1,-1
"Oh dear. I went on a Friday evening in April, expecting to hear Jazz. What I heard was so far from it. The band was driving people out of the bar. No Jazz, unprofessional music. I have been several times before, and they occasionally have good bands that actually play Jazz, but mostly it's a big miss music wise.  Service is good, food is okay but perhaps expensive for what it is. But the biggest let down is a Jazz bar booking non Jazz musicians. Toronto is not devoid of good Jazz musicians! I'd stay clear of this place until they get a real booker and some better music.",-1,-1
This place is ok if you just want to chill and have a few drinks and listen to  jazz. Be sure to make a reservation if you plan on going and be sure to be there on time and not a minute late because they will give away your table. The food is ok and the atmoshphere can be described as cozy if you like to sit at tables that are an inch apart.,-1,-1
"This will probably be my last time visiting this place. My family and I came here earlier tonight for a Mother Day's dinner. We ordered a set meal and the dishes came out at a decent time, and the food was good. It wasn't until near the end of dinner when we called for the bill my mom noticed on the slip of paper with our order written that one of the dishes didn't come. So we asked the waitress about it and she apologized and that she'll check. My mom told her no need since we're finished with dinner and would like to cancel that dish, but the waitress told her if the kitchen is making the dish then we can't cancel.  Anyway, by the time the dish arrived our table was already cleared. The waitress sets our table again - yes I know, just to eat one dish? We didn't even want it anymore, the food did not taste good bc it came out cold! After, the waitress came and said she'll bring us the desserts...well that took around 20 minutes! At this point, everyone was pretty much pissed out.  Overall, service was average..several times the servers either forgot to bring us refill of teas or brought us the wrong order and of course they forgot one of our orders. This was actually our second time that this had happened, the first time was on Chinese New Years - but we understood bc it was extremely busy and everyone's running around. But tonight wasn't too busy I thought..",-1,-1
"Located just 15 minutes from home.  Went here often before it was Vince's.  The food has definitely gone downhill since the old restaurant closed(name escapes me).  Portions i find are a bit small and dim sum is quite expensive due to their ""special"" selections which cost a lot more. Dim sum quality lacks in taste and i guess the only positive thing i can recall is the service.  Head somewhere else people...better options in the area.",-1,-1
"I really want to give Vince more stars, but I can't per the dinner last evening.    The main reason for the low rating was the inefficiency of the kitchen.  We placed our orders at 6:38pm (the ticket was time stamped).  We ordered a seafood tofu hot pot and a honey and pepper eel dish.  The hot pot arrived in 15 minutes.  The eel arrived at around 7:30pm.  Yap, it was a whole 35 minutes wait for the second dish.  We asked the waitress to follow up on the eel dish twice.  A manager finally lost it and took our ticket to the kitchen to follow up the third time. (At least the service on the restaurant front was good).  I noticed that 2 other tables around us also asked to follow up on their orders.  To be fair, both the hot pot and the eel dish were delicious without being oily at all.  The hot pot was of reasonable portion size, and the eel dish was a bit smaller than average, but this was well compensated by the deliciousness.   I have always enjoyed the overall dining experience at Vince since it has opened.  I enjoy its dinner more than its dim sum.  I hope the kitchen has had an off night yesterday only.  I will surely return to dine again and update the rating.  I hope the experience will be better.",-1,-1
"Food was good.  Really the food would have had me coming back.  The service was just terrible.  I don't have a high standard for service when I am at HK Style Restaurants because unfortunately, poor service & HK restaurants generally go hand in hand.  I mean the service is efficient, but poor.  Under-staffing and tip management is the main reason to blame, but that's a whole other story, for another time.  The service at this restaurant was depressing.  I got number for a table of 2 for me and my gf.  We're a small table so it was hard to flag anyone down.  The boss is too busy servicing the big table customers, and so are the service captains.  One of the waitresses that finally serviced our table did so very reluctantly.  Gave us almost a ""god, why are you even here, and sitting in my section?"" feeling.  The waitress that ended up servicing our table in the end (due to the fact that we were unable to flag down the same waitress again) was very friendly.  Oh and our tea pot came with a side of grease and sauce.  Yummy.  So we ordered a cup of ice water.  The cup was pretty dirty, so instead of telling them, we just ordered another cup of ice water--still dirty.  Food was great, everything else, not so much.  Won't be coming back until new management/owner.",-1,-1
"2.5*.  The food was mediocre.  The service wasn't great.  First, we were put in the small and dark back room (storage room?) when there were empty tables at the back upper section of the main restaurant.  Then they forgot to give us the dim sum menu.  Then we had to ask two times for hot sauce.  The SP dish - curry octopus- was over priced compared to the amount and quality of food received.  Our tea which they charged for was good and the staff was good about ensuring this was filled.  This was our second time there and we will not be returning.  Too many other places to go to in Markham.",-1,-1
"I vow to avoid this store as much as possible. Smugness is not a virtue yet some of the employees at this store can teach a class on it.  I did shop here knowing their prices were high yet it was convenient.   Yet due to their employees poor attitudes, other stores will get my business.",-1,-1
I  come here only when there's a deal or for the fried chicken... But I try to avoid coming as much as possible. The staff can be very rude and snobbish (for someone working a menial job).,-1,-1
"Tried out the new location tonight.  Great beer, the food was ok but the service was horrible.  Food took over 1 hour and our server just disappeared.  We ended up checking out at the bar.  I'd go back but I would never eat there again.",-1,-1
Soooooo.....torn between a 2 and a 3 here. Stopped in during a business trip looking for a good beer and food. The good - this place has a great outdoor seating area with loads of picnic tables and lawn area to hang out. Location is near airport in a very nondescript industrial zone. Inside the facility is REALLY loud - they were less than 50% of capacity and the ambient noise was pretty loud. Now for the food....ordered the black and blue burger and the burger itself was OK. Nothing spectacular but also not remarkable. The fries were the worst ever - lukewarm and chewy. How do you make French fries chewy??  Seriously???  OK....moving on from that. When I told my server about the fries she feigned interest but didn't go any further than that.  After thinking this over I'm going with the 2.  I'm not a huge fan of German beer so am not taking the beer quality into consideration in my review.,-1,-1
Went  on Friday night. 5 minutes at least at the bar to flag down a bartender. Once at a table at least 15 + minutes to flag down a server who told us food would be 1 hour. I left immediately. Went to Macs & got served in minutes. I took a date there & felt like an idiot. Never again!,-1,-1
"I'm a bit surprised by the positive reviews of this place. Yes, the beer hall atmosphere is nice, but when we went they only had 2 beers. 2 beers?! What kind of brewery only offers 2 beers? They had the signature OMB Copper and Captain Jack Pilsner. We both got the OMB Copper, which was just fine if not particularly unique.   The pretzel another reviewer raved about was nothing more than a Superpretzel Soft Pretzel that you can get from the freezer section at Wal-Mart, and the brat wasn't much more impressive.   I could see how it might be fun to come here with a big group for a tour and tasting, but don't think I'll be back any time soon...",-1,-1
"I had HIGH hopes for the OMB in its new location. I've enjoyed coming to OMB to participate in Yoga on Tap and always enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe at the old location. However, I visited the new location over Labor Day weekend and didn't experience the same treatment as I did at the old location. The layout is beautiful, the bathrooms are clean, the grass is green, but the service is TERRIBLE.   I was sitting inside with about 6 other people. It took 15 minutes to get someone even to notice that we were sitting there (the place wasn't even that crowded). After asking 3 people if could get some help, a very pleasant woman came by and helped us. We all ordered flights (4 smaller beers that give you the opportunity to taste a variety). When the beers finally arrived a different server brought them....totally fine, but she didn't know who ordered what and she didn't even know what beers were in each flight. So none of us even got what we had ordered. Then we ordered food and all of our orders were wrong. I was very disappointed and a little embarassed since I brought friends there from out of town.   My advice to you --- save yourself some time and head over to Triple C, NoDa Brewery or any other lovely brewery Charlotte has to offer. I'll give OMB a few months to smooth out those kinks before returning back.",-1,-1
"Everything about this joint was just ok. There is a very limited menu consisting of appetizers, and a variety of both sandwiches and brautwurts (that's it). I tired the wurst sampler and each of the sausages were rather bland, only one had some real flavor. The beer is what this place is supposed to be about but I found both beers I had to not be very good.  I came in OMB looking for a burger a beer and to watch the game, with only one TV I only got one of those things.  Def wouldn't run back there for anything.",-1,-1
I bought a used Dell desktop from him over a year ago. Thank god I know how to repair computers. I had to replace alot of the parts during that time.   -One of the DDR ram chips went bad. PC would not boot -CMOS Battery went dead. BIOS would loose the time and settings -Internal SD Card reader went bad. I had another one handy -DVD burner had to be replaced. It would hang on burning disks..  Now I find out that one of the sata ports is bad on the motherboard. Having to use another port instead..   His prices are also very high.,-1,-1
They wanted $50 plus tax for a DVD burner. Ordered the same part from newegg.com for  $12.99 tax and freight included. I don't mind paying an upcharge for local service but I do mind being taken advantage of. The person at the counter also had a nasty attitude. Never will go there again.,-1,-1
"Eh. Placed an order for delivery online for the first time tonight.  The confirmation said it would be 75 minutes, which wasn't unreasonable because the NBA Finals were on TV. It actually took 90 minutes and the pizza was barely warm, and definitely not hot. I had to put it in the oven. Ordered the Combo pizza. The Italian sausage was good, the peppers were ok, but the mushrooms were canned. Gross. The sauce was also way too sweet. Definitely not my favorite pizza and I won't be ordering from there again, especially when a large pizza is $20. If you charge that much for a pizza it better show up hot and it better be good.",-1,-1
"This is more a 2.5 stars restaurant ...  May be after reading all these reviews have hyped up my expectation of this restaurant. Ordered the signature Mama's pizza, meat ball and spaghetti and the cheese ravioli and was disappointed in all of them.    The crust of the pizza yes is thin but soggy when ordered extra crispy :-| .... and the sause is definitely not from fresh tomatoes ... and over salted  Meatball and spaghetti and the ravioli is slight better than what I can get from the frozen aisle in the supermarket .... ain't meeting the hype for sure.  Interior is very Chicago-ish, Service was good but it took them sometime to open the tomato can ...",-1,-1
"I really had to take time and taste this pizza and some how the thin crust with sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom was very salty either due to the sausage or pepperoni but either way its not the quality of items that I am use to in a pizza, a little history about myself I was raised in a family of catering I really get into the taste of food, the tomato sauce I really did not get that feeling on my taste buds of oh that's good, and by the way when a pizza place starts using a dough press instead of kneading the dough themselves looses 2 stars off the the top, you cannot replace kneading and a rolling pin . I have made pizza's before and i make my own sauce and use quality ingredients once you do it yourself for a while then you can really sharpen your taste buds for  quality pizza. I have to say CIBO has a better pizza, and Grimaldi's due to the fact that the dough, tomato sauce is much better quality.  ""The Gastro""",-1,-1
"Spinato's originated from Chicago. If I lived in Chicago I would be happy about them moving to AZ. My wife and I shared a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper pizza and did not enjoy it. The pizza was bland, maybe it was missing the fennel seeds in the italian suasage that seems to give the sausage that wonderful flavor. I couldn't quite pinpoint what was missing but I'm guessing I won't be making another visit to Spinato's.",-1,-1
"I ordered online for take out. I got the margherita pizza and a spinach calzone. The pizza had no sauce on it. None. Not like any margherita I've ever had. The calzone had way too much garlic and it was really sweet. Also, everything was incredibly oily. Yuck. It was almost inedible.   Also, there's a problem with their online ordering system. I ordered the pizza under my name. I had to set up an account with a password and everything. No big deal. When I placed my order the only option to pay was immediately instead of also at the pizza shop. My husband gave me his credit card to pay with and I did so. Still this is all fine other than the pizza shop losing out on a tipping opportunity but, whatever, not my business. When we got to Spinato's my order was nowhere to be found. They asked me if it could be under a different name and I said no I just set up my account and we already paid, what's going on with our order? Then as we're trying to figure out what happened we started going over what we ordered and then a man appeared with the food. My name was right on it. I pointed out that there's my name printed right on the piece of paper that's with the food. Then the lady behind the counter got a little condescending with her tone as she told me that the order is under the name on the credit card. I kept my name so me and my husband have different names. Why didn't she say this in the first place? Why the condescending tone? She might work there and know how the system is set up but, as a first time customer how would I?   Also, if the food is under credit card name and they require that you pay online immediately when you order then why do I need an account unless they want to spam me for ordering food from them? or sell my info for extra $$",-1,-1
"This is a terrible place to try to take a large group.  The food is mediocre at best.  But they run the place poorly.  We called ahead to see if they could seat a party of 8.  They told us that they could not take our name over the phone, instead we had to show up to put our names in.  My wife went ahead and reserved the table.  She was told it would be 45 minutes.  She came home and we began getting the kids ready.  We showed up 15 minutes before we were told, but they had already given the table away.  We were told that it would be another half hour before we could be seated.    Unfortunately, their waiting area is very packed and does not hold 8 comfortably.   We left, I will never go back.  It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat.  The main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle.  Spinato's does a good job of making life difficult.",-1,-1
Horrible. Tastes exactly like store bought microwave pizza or cafeteria pizza to be exact. Really bad. Don't know why people like it. I think they've just never had good pizza. The sauce is really bad too. Tastes like chef Boyardee. Disgusting!!!,-1,-1
"This place was very good before, but not anymore. They started doing $5 express takeout and $3 breakfast and last week they changed menu (not reflected on website yet). The original menu was good and food was great, but now they dropped the price by quite a lot (for example risotto from ~$25 to ~$15). I think this place has shifted to a cheap mediocre shop. Even though this place is no longer a nice dining choice of mine, I will try their express takeout just out of curiosity.",-1,-1
"My boyfriend got a good deal online for a 4 course meal for this resturant.  I have no idea whether they were under staff or not but that shouldnt be the issue, they couldve let us know for a heads up and not make us wait for each meal.  My first experience at vino rosso was horrible and this was on Valentine's day.  Dont get me wrong, the food was great but the SERVICE was hell.  They questioned us back if we wanted water when we clearly wanted water and they shouldve given water when we first sat down, i think that is proper service 101 for any resturant. Literally took them 20-30 minutes for each dish to come out.  Whole experience was feeling agitated and anxious.  And the last course which was dessert, the order that came out for me was wrong and didnt even take it back and my boyfriend and i wanted was get the bill and leave asap by than, so thats what happened, asked for the bill when dessert came, stuffed it down asap and left.  The customers to the right wasnt too happy either about their service, when they sat down, they waited probably about 20 minute to take their order and they had to get the waiter'waitress attention.  By the end, we told ourselve that we wouldve rather stayed in and order take out and not have dealt with the experience and expecially how cold it was outside.",-1,-1
"A group of co-workers decided to go here for summerlicious, first of all, summerlicious is an opportunity for restaurants to put out there their best food so you want to come back and pay regular price for it....well this place completely missed the mark on that.  The menu sounded appetizing but it began with the server bringing water to the table and proceeding to ask us for our food orders, that's all fine but then she didn't even ask if anyone wanted a drink (other than the water). Once our food came out it was a disappointment after disappointment, some food was cold, tasted like it had been re-heated and the best parts of anything was the sauces put on the food.  Definitely not going back here.",-1,-1
"Visited Vino Rosso for Summerlicious. The service was slow even though my table was the only party in the restaurant (this should have tipped us off about the quality already). No kidding, the entire place was empty except for us!   Service started out well enough, but the disappointments came one after the other. Our waiter came with bread for the table but then came late with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and then again parmesan cheese as well. I am not picky about my bread but the constant disruption was not appreciated and made me feel like the service was lagging. I found myself frustrated again when (1) our waiter offered to refill our water and never came back with it (2) we had to ask twice to get the bill and (3) it took forever to get the bill, once again, considering there were no other tables in the restaurant.   The food was equally underwhelming. The bread was gross, nothing more to say. The Caprese Insalata was decent but nothing special. My main, a Penne Arrabiata, tasted like glorified penne swimming in spicy tomato sauce. Definitely did NOT taste like fresh pasta as advertised. And for dessert, the waiter had the gall to tell me that I was getting a chocolate cake (Tartufo), when it was just chocolate ice cream. I could've gotten much better for much less at a local ice cream parlour. So disappointed. Will definitely not be going back to Vino Rosso. A total waste of my money.   PS. For those who care, they add an automatic 15% gratuity.",-1,-1
"THE CUSTOMER ALWAYS COMES LAST  I have not even visited this place and have a terrible opinion of it.  I would never set foot in it or speak well of the place as this restaurant in June wanted new customers so they offered a discount through Buytopia -- $15 spent for a $30 food voucher.  I'd been ill and so waited until I felt better -- the last weekend the voucher was valid.   I called to make a reservation and was told that they had what I call a ""bigger, better deal"" -- when they had the opportunity to rent out the whole place for those days, they did so.  I asked the man I was speaking to whether the voucher would be honoured later than the expiry date, considering that it was their fault that I could not redeem the voucher.  He told me, yes, they would; then said, ask the manager, though.  Uh oh.  I emailed the manager who said, yes, they booked the whole place but NO they would not honour the voucher after the expiry date (which THEY themselves, failed to honour, not I).  If you make a reservation, don't be surprised if you show up and they don't serve you because of...well, they're greedy and unprofessional and lack common sense.  I see this restaurant offering Groupon discounts, still.  BEWARE.",-1,-1
"I came here for lunch with a co-worker, the waitress (who has short black hair and a thick accent) seated us at our table and completely disregarded as for over 30 minutes, until I called her over asking for bread (that they always bring over), 7 minutes later she came back with 4 pieces of cold bread. She brought over our food, I ordered the chef's recommendation which was the tortellini - the portion size was incredibly small and it only came with four thinly sliced sausages. My co-worker ordered the fettuccine with mushrooms (don't remember the exact title) it was incredibly bland, basically it was fettuccine, some mushrooms, and heavy cream, it had absolutely no flavor. The waitress only offered us black pepper and did not offer us parmigiana cheese, when in fact she offered it to everyone else. When I asked for more bread, she came back 10 minutes later with more cold bread, I had to ask her to bring us fresh bread, she disappeared for another 5 minutes and came back with hot bread (which I'm 100% was just microwaved).  All in all, I would not recommend this place to anyone. Not unless you really like bad service and bland tasting food.",-1,-1
"We had a three course meal here for lunch. Nothing special. The menu said ""crabcakes"" but it only came with 1 crabcake :(. The chicken parmesan was a bit dry. The dessert was not memorable.  The service was slow. I ate 2 baskets of bread by myself waiting for our mains to arrive, and I was still hungry leaving this place...  Not worth $25.",-1,-1
"I went here on Valentine's Day. The service was so slow. It took them 20 mins to get my boyfriend and me water and we actually asked for it twice. For the 4 course meal, it also took so long, like 30 mins for each course. They has Valentine's manu for that day but I asked for regular menu as well because I wanted to order something else. The waitress gave me the manu but when I finally decided what to order, she told me that they couldn't do regular manu because they don't have enough time. Anyways, the food is good; just the service.",-1,-1
"This is my first time rating on Yelp as I felt it is necessary to inform everyone about what I experienced in this restaurant. We made a reservation for lunch with a few of my coworkers. I've read on Yelp that this restaurant is very understaffed and they're fairly slow on preparing the food orders. I didn't expect to wait 40 mins for an appetizer; after finishing the appetizer, we were all waiting for the main course. We waited for another 20 mins but no food has showed up yet, and we asked the waiter if the food will be ready. We waited another 10 mins and realized that we have already been in the restaurant for over an hour and it had already passed our allowed lunch time; we have only had an appetizer. As a result, we asked the waiter to have our lunch to go. Since the summerlicious menu we paid for also includes dessert, we asked the waiter if we could get the dessert to go. He was extremely unhappy about it and told us that ""you can't expect us to have your food ready in 25 mins! If you want dessert, you have to wait!"" (But we were there for over an hour). Overall, the food was not the best quality I had. It was not worth the money and time to go. Make sure you guys read Yelp before going!",-1,-1
"Went here on a Tuesday using a Travelzoo voucher. The portion sizes are small. The appetizers we had were small but tasty. I ordered the NY Striploin medium and my associate ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon. The steak was a chewy and my associates Salmon looked cooked but was raw inside. They tried to recook it and made it worse, it was now so chewy that my associate lost her appetite.   On the other hand the service was good. There server was empathetic and tried to make it right, but there is only so much he could do.   **EDIT** As per the Owners Response. I did mention above I used a TravelZoo voucher. The owner mentions that no bill was bought to the table. He is correct, we already paid $49 for the voucher, so more than 3/4 portion of it was already paid for. My comment was for the food alone, I would like to point out is the Salmon was RAW inside, not medium rare. As far as I know in Ontario food must be cooked well unless advised by the customer (for steaks, etc). So unless I am mistaken, what I read from the owners response, is that if you do come here for any special or voucher and if the food turns out to be uncooked, you do not have the right to be upset or post any negative reviews.",-1,-1
"Came here on a Thursday night with a Buytopia deal for a 3 course meal for 2 people that comes with a glass of wine or beer.  I wanted to call ahead to make a reservation but the phone number for the restaurant does not work during the day, it rings once then goes to a recorded message ""Sorry the number you have called is not a sign"". I called almost every hour from 12 until 5pm and finally by 6pm, the call gets through. Super weird!  When we got there, the place had a few tables, but the vibe felt very empty. There was one server working all night. She seemed like she was either new or have barely any experience at all. She gave us the set menu to choose as we showed her the deal. She came back every 5 mins asking if we were ready and every time we would say we need more time. We asked for water to start off our meal and we didn't get it until 15 mins later after we ordered. And we had to remind her one last time before she came with it, most likely have forgotten when there's only one other table in the restaurant.  She brought over some bread, which seemed like its homemade with a little olive oil drizzled on top of it. But as I took a little bit into the bread, I spilt it right out!! It was SUPER SALTY!!! Like it was dipped in salt or something!!  Our appetizers came which was the grilled calamari and crab cakes. BOTH were SALTY as well! Calamari was cold topped with some homemade salsa which tasted like diced tomatoes and onions tossed in olive oil. There were canned grilled red peppers on the side but they were cold as if they literally came out of the fridge.   The crab cake was one round piece size of your palm cut in half. I only tasted potatoes, corn and carrots. There was no crab or didn't see any sight of crab. Tasted like I was eating potato cakes instead. SUPER DISAPPOINTING!!  The mains came, which were a tapilia and 7oz steak, both with vegetables. The tapilia was dry and tasted like it has been in the freezer for ages, it had a FREEZER TASTE! The steak was cooked at the right color but it tasted stale and you can tell by the texture that it's an old piece of steak. The texture felt like it was a medium well when I ordered a medium rare, it looked like a medium rare though, which I got so confused. The steamed/boiled vegetables were the WORSE!!! One big piece of brocoli that had to be boiled for over 10 mins, it was MUSHY like baby food! The carrots were also OVERCOOKED and MUSHY, also like baby food!! The potatoes were yukon gold, cut up into BIG chunks, some were also overcooked so it was MUSHY but there was one piece that was RARE, CRUNCHY when I bit into it. WORSE VEGETABLES I have ever eaten!!  Desserts were a tiramisu and new york cheesecake. The cheesecake tastes okay since you can tell that it was store brought and not made in house. The tiramisu tasted okay but texture was SUPER MUSHY!!  Overall, EVERYTHING IS BAD!! FOOD IS SALTY, MUSHY, totally NOT SUPPOSE TO BE WHAT IT TASTED!! The waitress was weird all night, everytime coming to the table making it very awkward; either trying to rearrange the dishes to make it seem more convinent for us but actually not, trying to ask us about the food but reacting in an awkward way, it just made us feel UNEASY!  WILL NEVER COME BACK AND DON'T SUGGEST ANYONE COMING!!!!",-1,-1
"For the prices at this store the quality of service is very poor.  When the shop used to be across the road, before the condo was built there, the service was very personal and helpful.  Now everything about the store including the staff remarks and the prices is a bit on snobby side and if you are looking for a pet which is not a dog or a cat, then the clerk will wriggle up her nose in disgust.  I asked where I could find Mouse food and she directed me to the back wall where there was none.  When I asked at the desk a SECOND time, after waiting in line this time, she said we don't carry it LOL.  Well that was a wasted free steps except I did look at the treats and I found a few made in Canada which is good so they got my money.  They made no effort to order the food for me even though they clearly order from Oxbow for other creatures.  I then called Global down the road a couple of blocks and they didn't have it either but she immediately offered to order it for me.  I even told the Pet Valu clerk that I was disappointed she didn't order it for me but she is the expert in teflon remarks.  They also carry mouse treats made in China which for anything that an animal will ingest is very disappointing.  When I mentioned this to the clerk I got this teflon remark ""well we can't have everything made in CAnada"".  I have shopped here since we first got our first pet (dog) in 2006 and I can honestly say I don't like this location any longer.  The one mouse wheel we purchased was broken and we had no problems with the products purchased at Pet Smart but the Pet Smart is an american store and it's quite a bit further away.  Still at least they have stock and they show gratitude.  I would have thought for the money I did spend today I would have at least heard the word thank you.  There are lots of other places to choose on this stretch of Bloor,  don't waste your money or your time here.",-1,-1
"Unfortunately, we had the worst server in the restaurant.  She was a blond woman with glasses and seemed to be spending more time socializing at the bar vs. waiting on tables.  Our food took over an hour and even then one entree was missing.  Never received any refills on our water and we also made the mistake of ordering dessert...  The dessert took another half an hour and our ice cream was fully melted.    I am quite sure this is an awesome restaurant, but we just had the worst server employed there.  Hopefully mgmt knows who this server is based on my description, they see this review, and take disciplinary action.    Very disappointed, will not be recommending this place to anyone.",-1,-1
"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a family function.  I had no idea there was even a restaurant in this area being that it's in a small strip mall but it takes up most of the space, about half it seems.  The inside of this restaurant is really visually striking.  The red and black theme is throughout the interior from the signs, walls, and tables.    The menu has a mixed of antipasto, salads, pasta, meats, fish, risotto and pizzas.  It's a decent mix of dishes and choices.  I ended up getting the quattro stagione and my wife had ordered the white potato pizza.  The quattro stagione literally translated means four seasons.  I'm used to seeing this pizza's ingredients on each of the 4 quarters pizzas like quadrants.  I didn't get it that way for some reason.  All the ingredients (mushrooms, prosciutto, olives and artichokes) were evenly spread across the pizza.  It was still decent but just not what I was expecting to see.  My wife ate about half of her potato pizza.  Typically if we go to a place that serves pizza she'll always go with a white pizza (no red sauce) if it's an option and she likes potato pizza in general where ever she can find it.  She only ate half of it as she usually does but she said it was too greasy.  I was too full to have any of her pizza since I ate all of mine at the restaurant.  The potato pizza came with onions and pancetta.  I'm used to pancetta being thicker and more fatty like bacon.  Honestly this pancetta looked like deli sliced cooked ham.  We took home the left overs and I ended up eating them that night.  I have to say the potato pizza was very greasy I have to agree with my wife.  The bottom crust was in fact saturated and it wasn't pretty.  Overall the pizzas weren't out of this world and I can safely say that in the GTA we've had much better than this.  It seemed that the toppings weren't very generous or distributed properly.  I mean the quattro stagione is not even in quarters.  Don't get me wrong I've had Neapolitan style pizza before so I know what to sort of expect and mind you this place although not VPN certified like Libretto or Pizza e Pazzi doesn't have to be like many other places out there but I simply found this pizza to be not as good all around.    Whether it's the thickness of the crust or the ingredients simply put it's not as good as some of the other non-VPN Neapolitan type style pizza out there in the GTA (850 Degrees, Napoli Centrale).  It is IMO a notch lower than Grazie.  I can't speak to the rest of the menu but as far as the pizza for me, this is not a go to place.  The service was attentive and friendly.",-1,-1
"Motorino is one of the restaurants in my neighbourhood, so expectations at finding another great place to dine at were high. Needless to say, since my initial visit I have yet to go back. The place has a youthful, high energy vibe about ........one would hope the food and the service would live up to the hype. We arrived without a reservation so we had to wait for a table to become available. Certainly not the restaurants fault. We perused the menu while waiting and the wait was only approx. 10 minutes. The smells in the restaurant were intoxicating.....so by the time our waiter came by for a drink order, we were ready to order our food. Waiters attitude was off-putting, as though he was doing us the favour by  allowing himself to be our server. We ordered and off he went.......never came back to check on us. He did stop by a table near to us as he had friends in dining that night and actually sat with them for a few minutes chatting.....all while we had empty drink glasses in front of us. We had to flag him down on one of his many trips past us for a drink refill order.  Food arrived after a substantial wait (it was very busy so one must expect the kitchen to be overwhelmed) but it was unmemorable. Two of us had ordered pizza...and both agreed we've had much better elsewhere. The other members of our party were equally unimpressed with their food.  Obviously this restaurant is going for a younger crowd than us (lol) but the noise, combined with average food flavour, warrants this rating.  We have not gone back",-1,-1
It's a pity. It was very nice restaurant. Right now I'm having lunch. It's empty. Including us 4 people. Before it was packed. employees look unhappy. I went to washroom. It was dirty. No soap no paper. How did they turn in too bad from an outstanding restaurant it's unbelievable. . It's going to be my last visit.,-1,-1
"We really wanted to like this place as its close to home but unfortunately will not return. The first part of our night went well...the place was not busy at all so we were quickly seated, good vibe, trendy decor, youthful and family-friendly. Our waiter started out great - very personable tho the poor guy had to spend almost 5 minutes on his spiel about the 12+ items on Special. He provided some good recommendations on apps and mains. The octopus salad was a great kick-start to the night. This was followed by an avocado and burrato stromboli which was over a foot-long and very filling (they messed up this order by putting ham in it but we took it because it looked yummy). We only had a small piece each in order to save room for the mains. Well that wasnt necessary since we hardly touched the mains - the papardelle was over-cooked and sticking together and the fennel salad was very over-dressed. The biggest dissapointment were the fridge-temperature meatballs - not room temperature, but they were actually cold inside. We couldnt find out waiter for a while and twice had to ask different staff to retrieve him. The hostess/manager was good about taking care of these items on the bill and providing complementary dessert. Based on the other positive reviews, this place could be a hit or miss but I definitely wouldn't chance it again.",-1,-1
"Had dinner tonight at this restaurant with my husband. All in all I wasn't impressed. Pizza was very flimsy and soggy. Cesar salad had little flavour. Penne a la vodka was very good. Service was awful. Our waiter was too busy so she had another server take our order. She then proceeded to not ever come to our table and we had no waiter the whole evening. we had to ask for everything - drinks, water refills and hot oil multiple times. We had to ask to pay our bill multiple times. Asked for the manager to come over and he never showed. After waiting about 15 minutes we just left. Do not recommend and will never return.",-1,-1
"Was recommended to eat at this unfriendly place. The staff made us feel that they were doing us a favour for eating at their restaurant. The wait staff was a joke. We started out with an Italian waiter that could not be understood since his English was terrible, he mumbled and treated us as we never have been to an Italian restaurant. He also looked dirty with a pencil mustache. He kept coming back to our table even though we told him that we are not ready to order. We then got a replacement of another useless waiter. This guy was spraying tables like a lunatic with sterilizer that could be smelled from across the room. When will they learn to spray the liquid on the rag?  So if anyone is looking for over dressed salads, oily pastas, heartburn pizza and bad espresso this is the place. Downtown prices poorly executed dishes. The food ingredients were fresh. Only positive.  Italian mall food would be better.",-1,-1
We were there for Groupon. The service was very good from the ladies. That's where it end. The atmosphere is very poor. The lighting makes me feel dull. The cook doesn't even know how to make the atmosphere enjoyable. It seems like he just want to get the cooking over with and barely have a smile. He price is definitely high for the cooking and taste of this restaurant.,-1,-1
"ATROCIOUS. The service was slow, disorganized and inattentive. We ordered sushi as an appetizer which arrived after our soup and salad. The sushi was far below average - don't even touch the yellowtail. As we waited for our appetizers our wine came even slower and apparently sharing a glass of water is a thing. The other people at the table all received their cooked appetizers before the meal. The teppanyaki chef was dull and rushing to get through our table. Sadly he wasn't in such a hurry as to cook our filet mignon rare as ordered. In short nothing went well. The food was bland, poorly prepared and presented.",-1,-1
"If I could, I would have given this no star. I am a big teppanyaki fan and have been to many other teppanyaki restaurants outside and inside of Toronto. Yet it was not only the worst Teppanyaki experience I have ever had, but also one of the worst restaurant experiences overall..  It's been few weeks since I had my first (and hopefully the last) visit to Hibachi. Two of my girlfriends and I came in right on time for our reservation. The hostess approached us then said our table was not ready. It was understandable at first since it was a busy friday night. She had us seated at the bar and we ordered a cocktail each just to kill some time. Everything was great until then. The cocktails were tasty and we were all in a good mood. We didn't know it'd take more than 40 mins for them to actually ""get our table ready"". We finished our drinks after 20 mins and very kindly asked the hostess when our table will be ready. She said she will figure it out for us then left us for another good 20mins without giving us any heads up. After some time, FINALLY the other hostess (different one from the one who sat us at the bar) told us the table is ready and we HAVE TO settle our bills before we leave the bar. So we settled our bills.   We were seated at the table and not after so long, the server approached us. We already knew what we wanted and ordered. He said we have to wait for the table to be filled. So we waited.. again. Skipping to the conclusion, the whole process of waiting for the other customers to arrive, to order food, and to actually have the chef show up to the table took ANOTHER 35 mins. We were starving.   The show began and it was just mediocre. Same old onion volcanoes and some other basic tricks that you see at other teppanyaki restaurants. For food, we ordered a green dragon roll to share as an appetizer, then fillet mignon for myself and two other things from their teppanyaki main menu for my friends. The green dragon roll, I still remember just because of the poorly cut avocados on top of the roll. Wanted my fillet mignon to be cooked rare and turned out to be cooked medium. My friends and I were actually too tired out to make complaints by the time we were served. The food, to be honest, was not the worst but not the best either.   In total, it took hibachi 75MINS to put just any food into our mouths. I understand how the teppanyaki restaurants work.. but this was just overwhelming.  And yet, the best part hasn't come out. We were just about half way done eating when we heard something unexpected. Apparently, who seemed to be like the manager or the supervisor was YELLING at one of his staffs in front of all the  customers. It was really REALLY uncomfortable to witness the whole yelling, shouting, and swearing while eating. Yes, swearing. We didn't finish our food. We just asked for the bill, paid, then came out.   The staffs were nice and friendly, but that is actually the only nice thing I could say about this place. If anyone wants to try teppanyaki, just go somewhere else. It's just not worth it to spend the amount of time and the money for such place.",-1,-1
"The service was friendly and engaging, but when it comes to the food, well mind I say the most overpriced and overrated I've ever encountered in Toronto?   It feels like you've walked into the 1990s where people crowd around teppanyaki as a form of exotic oriental performance, that said, the food is inevitably secondary to the performance they've put on.   I truly do believe there is a lot of work, effort, and skill each and every chef invests in, but as a restaurant itself, I can't bring myself to say I would ever come here again or pretend to like the lacklustre-uneventful taste of such a theatrical meal.   You're paying $30+ for a performance, a seat at a orientalist facade. With all that being said, service was friendly, but the food comes before all decor or presentation",-1,-1
"I've been hearing the hype about this place for a while. Now that it is around the corner from my house I decided to give it a try. We started with a salad that came with unedible croutons and greens I needed a knife to make a reasonable size. For the pizza we ordered the Quattro Formaggi. Is it standard at Settebello that the dough is so soggy all the cheese & sauce slides right off the pizza? If this is what ""Real"" pizza is supposed to be like I'm not interested. Flavor was good though. Our server was pretty nice, dÃ©cor is fine. During our visit the place was mostly empty.  I'm going to give Settebello a shot a few months from now to see how I feel about it- This location is fairly new.   Grimaldi's is still my favorite pizza place for now.",-1,-1
One of the worst pizza places I've ever been to. If you want soup go to sweet tomatoes. Because that's what this pizza is like.  Truly a disappointment they should have stayed in Henderson where they belong.,-1,-1
Came here with 3 hungry people for our 1st visit. No direction was offered. Ordered crostini appetizer & settebello pizza. Appetizer was basically for 2. Pizza was VERY small & surprisingly extremely soggy. No Parmesan cheese or red peppers on the table or offered. Very shocked as this restaurant came highly recommended & reviewed. Left very disappointed & hungry,-1,-1
"Nothing to Write Home To Mama About  Please take this with a grain of salt as this is our first visit.  Based on the interior of the restaurant, we had high hopes for our first binge meal after five weeks of almost no-carb fasting. The chairs and tables are warm dark wood and leather, as are the booths. Nice high ceilings and a beautiful large bar area, segmented off from the main restaurant.  That's where the niceness ends unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is a family owned business, but the service was neither prompt nor overly friendly. We came in the middle of the afternoon with only two other customers in the place. The host seemed like he was just wandering aimlessly around the dining area and just happened to see us. The booths are not exactly comfortable, as I think the backs are a bit too tight and push you forward to the table.  Quick summation of the meal:  Arugula salad (Panzanella): probably the best thing we had. Homemade croutons and little dried pieces of proscuttio topped with large shavings of parmigiano.  Meatball appetizer: five small meatballs in so-so tomato sauce and topped with basil slivers. Meatballs were cold (as in freezer cold) in the middle and not especially tasty. You can see that the cheese on top is not even slightly melted, which is rather indicative of the overall temperature of the dish.  Salsiccia e Friarielli (sausage and broccoli) pizza. Sausage was not bad at all, but appeared to be tossed on the pizza in very uneven clumps. The dough was also not bad, but the chef definitely needs more experience with his or her oven. Burnt on the outside, raw on the inside. This can happen now and then with a good hot pizza oven, but added to everything else it just added insult to injury.  So, salad, pizza, appetizer. $50.00 for lunch. Not a great first experience in the Village Square on Sahara. We might visit Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana sometime in the future, but it might take a few months to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",-1,-1
"I was very underwhelmed the second time I visited. Not sure whether it's because we got some of the ""cheaper"" options (the Monday $5 Margarita pizza) and the happy hour pizza...the pizzas left much to be desired. We got the mini sausage pizza on the happy hour menu. They didn't do a good job at all of spreading the cheese evenly on the pizza -- in fact, one slice didn't have any cheese at all!? There was only one piece of basil. The margarita pizza was just as pitiful...the cheese was really only on half the pizza, only one piece of basil (basil is kind of a key part of a margarita pizza!?), and worst of all the bottom of the pizza was completely soggy. The pizza -- I mean dough with tomato sauce (and maybe a tiny piece of cheese) -- was pretty much falling apart as I was eating it. We also got drinks. I thought that their mule was fine, but my friend ordered the Old Fashioned and felt like they kind of skimped on that drink. More than half of the drink was a giant ice cube.  The one redeeming thing is that their sausage is actually pretty good.",-1,-1
"I love the Happy Hour menu but the service just continues to get worse and worse. Their reverse happy hour is from 8-9 pm, and on the last two times I've gone, I arrived with some friends at 8:25. The server Tricia literally greeted the table by saying ""You know you have 10 minutes to order right?"". How about Good evening! Welcome to Settebello! Can I get some drinks started for you? Lol. Didn't check on us once and we had to ask the busser to order another round of drinks. I get you want to leave, but it's just plain rude. There's plenty of good happy hours in the area with great food AND service, don't go where they obviously don't want the business.",-1,-1
"The atmosphere was on point, and the staff were great. Overall, the food was of good quality. However, the pizza was boring.   It lacked flavor is the best way to put it. The only flavor that stood out was that of burning fire, like a marshmallow without the deliciousness of a mallow. I also enjoy my pizza crust crisp or at least the opposite of soggy. However, that's this style of pizza-- doughy in the center.   I won't be returning and not because of the service. The pizza was really that uneventful.",-1,-1
"We are absolutely furious with the pizza makers. They burnt all 4 pizzas which is absolutely ridiculous. ONLY GO WHEN AUGUSTINE IS WORKING ALONE. The cooks other than Augustine have burnt every single pizza that I have seen come out of the oven. I saw the two cooks and they both were not paying attention and we're talking to each other while the pizza was cooking. Whether the oven is hot or not, they both burned all of the pizzas that came out of the oven. I would rather pay double for Augustine to make and cook the pizza because he doesn't burn it first of all and the flavor is more deep and the mozzarella is perfectly melted. I feel like I wasted my money and time today because I cannot even eat the crust or the bottom of the pizza because it was all completely soggy and burned. Like what I am left with to eat... The toppings?! I think Augustine should be the main chef at Settebello because he is consistently making perfect pizzas which is the only reason why we go there and gave 5 stars in the past. I will not be going there anymore except on Sunday's when Augustine works there and the two other cooks are not. My point is why should I pay $45 for a couple burned pizzas? Also, I usually don't like to write bad reviews, like last time I was there, there was strand of blonde hair and well what do you know... the pizza was burnt. And of course Augustine was not the cook. If you like burned pizzas this is the place for you.",-1,-1
"My cat came to me as a foster in 2008. In Spring 2009, he was starting to go outside his box and had trouble urinating. He clearly had a UTI and it was dire. You can't mess around with male cats and UTIs.  So, Annex Cat Rescue sent me to this clinic and I got the horrendous experience of dealing with Dr. Ron Pousong.   He had to be coaxed into doing blood/urine testing. He told me the (fixed) cat ""probably saw another cat outside and got excited"" and wasn't actually sick. Yes, he was twitterpated - OK sure!  When the results came back, he was very wishy-washy about the medication that would be required. He started yelling at me on the phone when I questioned his approach and insisted he get the meds ready for same day pick up. There were many ways to treat this condition and his solution was to give me 21 teeny tiny pills to shove down the cat's throat daily for 3 weeks.  The meds didn't work. He needed stronger ones on a shorter course. Eventually, he got the care he needed elsewhere.  My cat also got fleas while there, but they'll deny it til they're blue in the face.  Don't. Ever. Go. Here.",-1,-1
"Had such a horrible experience with the female Veterinarian on staff, that I am thisclose to lodging a complaint against her with the OVMA.  Never, in almost 20 years of caring for my dogs, have I ever been treated in this manner.   Never again.    Banks Animal Hospital has lost a family of customers.  3 homes with a menagerie of dogs and cats.  Shame on you.",-1,-1
"They lost my friends dog, then neglected to tell them for HOURS. Still no explanation.   Thankfully Winni was found.",-1,-1
"If you want to take your pet to a vet office that doesnt give a crap about your pet take them here. I have had many bad experiences with this office with my mom's dogs and I am pretty sure this place is more expensive than other vets.  The older doctor is a real douche. My mom's older dog became quite sick with artheritis and he was prescribed meta cam. The vet scared me into thinking it was a spinal tumor (because he knew I work in a human neurosurgery unit in a hospital) and said that the dog needed all sorts of expensive tests (X-ray under sedation, blood work etc) and it would all cost like $700+. I left crying because my moms dog was so sick and in pain he was shaking from the pain. Later he was prescribed METACAM for his pain and my mother sent me down there from her home to pick it up for her while she stayed with the dog who was in really bad shape.   My mom though because her credit card was on file and her dogs had been patients at Banks for 10+ years that it wouldnt be a huge issue to give the $79 metacam to me. But it was. They refused to issue the medication to me without payment on the spot and wouldnt run the credit card even by talking to her on the phone. So I had to drive back to her house pick her up and bring her down all while the dog is in agony at home. The receptionist said ""i'll check with the doctor"" and the older gentleman refused to give the medication without payment, something which had been done before with a different vet at the same place. It's not even like it wouldnt have been paid for my mother was willing to drive down right after to give them the money we were more concerned with not leaving the dog alone in agony which this vet didnt care about.  I've heard other bad things about this office so I'd take my pet elsewhere. I take my cat to Queen West Animal Hospital. If thats out of area for you (which it is for my mom) then I'd maybe go to the Leslieville Animal Hospital or anywhere but here. These people don't care about your pet. They care about money.",-1,-1
"There are good things and bad  things about Sante of Chandler.   YOU MUST BE VERY VERY INVOLVED AND DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING FOR YOU LOVED ONE.  DON'T ASSUME THEY ARE ON THE BALL AND WILL HANDLE EVERYTHING.   The good things:  The rooms/facility are extremely nice and clean.  Patients don't have to share a room with another person.  They have a great dining room and really good food.  Nurses and Aids are prompt at responding when you ring the call button for assistance. The physical and occupational therapy was outstanding and got my mom stronger and stronger by the day.   The bad things:  On call doctors who won't return calls after hours when patient is in pain.   Doctors who won't ok over-the-counter aspirin for mom's  pain even when she only needed it  once a week or so and had no reason she should not take it.  (She doesn't have kidney issues or other reasons you wouldn't take aspirin, Tylenol doesn't help.)  By mistake they sent my mom's medical records with another patient to her off campus doctor's appointment and sent the other patients medical records with my mom to her doctor's appointment.   They scheduled my mom an appointment with a specialist who does not take my mom's insurance.    The drivers who take patients to their doctor appointments never arrive in time unless you have someone get them on the phone just in the nick of time.  They often have a slightly wrong address in their phone GPS and take the patient to the wrong address.  A psych nurse requests medications be given which are contraindicated with the current medications mom was taking.  (Floor nurse discovered this and refused to give the medication thankfully.)  After each of these issues I notified the director John and each time he said would personally handle mom's case.  So much for that.   The staff is terrific and caring, it the training and management that needs different procedures and to train people better.",-1,-1
"Same as Jo Ann review 10 days ago. Rarely checked in on my Dad. Also got a UTI. Sent to hospital and Sante discharged my dad on a Friday at 2:00pm, holiday weekend, and never called us! My mom figured it out when she went back to his room at 5 to get some things while he was in hospital. We figured we'd be going back to Sante. Nope. Discharged because he wasn't progressing enough, after they told us they would make this decision the following Tuesday. Sent my mothers BP through the roof.  We asked case worker why she didn't call mom to tell her that dad had been discharged....she said they have a lot of patients. Very traumatic experience for our family",-1,-1
"My 86 y.o. Dad went to Sante for rehab after a fall and shoulder fracture.  Unfortunately, Sante fell short in what I feel are the basic requirements a ""Skilled Nursing Facility"" should possess. Dad received minimal ""rehab"" for which they blamed him ""you are not progressing."" My chief complaints are as follows: 1) Patient developed a UTI while in Sante and almost a week passed before he was given antibiotics for the infection. 2) Patient was severely dehydrated and his fluid intake was not being monitored by staff (No one checking to make sure he was drinking enough water). They mentioned they ""could administer an IV"" but that never happened.  3) Patient was transported to a Dr's appointment in 35-40 degrees temps without a coat, jacket or even a blanket wrapped around him.) 4) Patient's food consumption was not monitored and Dad lost 10 pounds over 2 weeks on the ""cake and ice cream diet"". 5) The staff moved the bed down real low and when we inquired about it, were told Dad was a ""fall risk"" and later learned he had fallen from the bed. 6) Housekeeping (dirty linens, etc. left in the room, we had to remove them ourselves). 7) Most of the staff providing the care are NA's and students who did not appear to be trained in how to get someone with a shoulder fracture and limited mobility out of bed. 8/9) Long wait times when patient pressed call button. Not friendly, at times sarcastic nursing staff. If you complain they turn it on you as though it's your fault. Gosh I could go on and on. It was difficult to speak to the Coordinator (RN) in charge of my Dad's care. She seemed too busy to sit down for 2 minutes and discuss our concerns about Dad. She didn't return my calls either, even when my message said ""this is urgent.""  I do not recommend Sante.",-1,-1
"he place is nice and clean. The PT and OT seemed to do a good job. There are a few downsides 1) It is almost impossible to get a person to call you back. I was calling and they would pick up the phone and hang up. I went in, sat in the lobby and watched to see what happened. She did answer in front of me. 2) Jennifer, the social worker is inept. If you are able to pin her down to talk to her her standard answer is either ""I have a brochure for that"" or ""a telephone number for that"". Her knowledge is extremely limited, so don't count on any help from them. I was very frustrated, until I finally realized she just doesn't have an understanding of what the clientele needs. She is not proactive and cannot help with anything. Look elsewhere for help. 3) The case manager is also inept. They explained that unless she did PT and OT, Medicare wouldn't pay and they would discharge her. But her pain from the breaks was horrific. Luckily, her doctor came in and changed the pain medication. She was able to tolerate the pain and make progress. Do not look to the case manager for any help. Look outside.",-1,-1
"The 1st two times i went there i really liked it! I really liked my nails the 1st time, 2nd i went they were too thick. Now i just went on valentine day with ny boyfriend i had fills and he did a manicure the lady that did my boyfriend nails was more into him then doing a good job, the lady that did my nails you could tell she didn't want to do it.  She was far away, making faces and had an attitude.  The Monday follow valentine day my pinky nail popped off so i went in and had it fix now i had to go back in because my pointer and middle finger popped off. When i got there the lady stood up to go to the  bank and the other guy was just on the phone. I don't even think she went to the bank because i heard her speaking in the back room, so i got up and left. I don't understand how if you were just sitting there when a customer come in then you have to go to the bank. Terrible",-1,-1
"This is a really nice place and the staff is very friendly, but I have experienced better. I made sure I called in the morning and made a late afternoon appointment for me, my sister and my niece for my nieces birthday. She wanted to get her toes done, so I thought it would be fun for all of us to get it done together. When we got there, right around our appointment time, they were slammed. Yes I understand they randomly get busy with different people and different parties, hence the reason I made an appointment. After waiting a half hour after our appointment time, they put me and my niece together and put my sister clear over on the other side. So we weren't all able to talk and visit while getting our toes done like I wanted to. Our pedicures were also rushed and I feel like done half..... you know what. They did this because they were busy and had to get everyone in. My niece and I ended up getting done 20 minutes before my sister so we had to wait another 20 minutes to leave. It just wasn't the great bonding experience we wanted for my nieces bday. There is no point in going in a group and making an appointment when nothing is accomodated. Also it shouldn't take 2 hours to get 3 pedicures done, especially with making an appointment! It threw off the rest of my nieces bday plans for the evening! Really disappointed.",-1,-1
"I decided to take my two daughters with me to get pedicures, two manicures and a full set for me.  Everything was going great when we were getting our pedicures; when we sat down for our manicures one of the nail technicians started screaming at her husband.  She became so mad at him that she was screaming at him the entire time I was getting my full set and my daughters were getting their manicures.  Her husband was the one working on my daughter's manicure and he ended up speeding through it because he had to go outside because she would not stop screaming.  The man who was working on my nails started yelling at her about the customers and he was telling me how sorry and embarrassed he was.  I felt bad for him, but he started to rush just to get us out of there because she was becoming irate.  She was walking around holding bottles of nail polishes when she dropped three of them right next to me.  She started saying sorry, but my purse was on the floor along with glass and I'm not trying to sound like a brat, but my purse was just given to me by my husband that was a Michael Kors purse that cost $400.  I was so upset and the man who did my nails did not even file them all the way because he rushed.  They were so lumpy.  I walked out of their spending $270!  I will never return again.",-1,-1
Place was beautiful clean with lots of color choices. But the person that did my mini pedi was clearly didn't have experience.  cut my nails down to where the flesh meets the nail and then still tried to file and buff them OUCH! Then took forever to paint my teeny tiny toenails. They looked like a 5 yr old painted em. Then the owner came over to see what was talking forever and took over finishing me up.,-1,-1
First time here... Lady who did my pedicure didn't know how to so a french pedi... So another lady finished my toes. Then I waited 30 minutes to get a fill!??? They aren't super busy but unorganized as they took a walk in before me? I guess this is what I get for trying a new place!! I would not recommend this nail salon!!! The only reason I came in here is because my salon is closed for the holiday and I couldn't wait until Friday to get this done... I paid for my pedicure and left. They told me they would give me a 20% discount on my fill when I come back? I won't be going back.,-1,-1
Friendly service and good pedicure. Unfortunately this will not be my new manicure place. My gel manicure lasted 6 days before it started to peel up on the edges..... I usually get at least 2 weeks wear.,-1,-1
"Two weeks ago to the day, I Decided to try this place out since it was right by my house. Reviews were decent and I am pretty picky about my nails so I was hoping they were going to be great. When I went inside I noticed there was only one person there. Seemed rather slow. But I sat with Tracy. Tracy was nice. Soft spoken. There was another nail tech that sat next to her, waiting for her nails to dry. Assuming she worked there because she walked around like she owned the place.  I had removed my acrylics days prior to coming in. When she heard me telling Tracy that I did that, with a judgy attitude she was shocked I removed them on my own. Sorry but I can use acetone and soak them off on my own. No need to pay you to do them for me. Plus just the look and tsk tsk tsk she gave me was not called for.  Anyway. Back to Tracy. I asked for rounded nails and she gave me square wide nails. One was completely crooked. But I was just ready to leave the place.  So here we are exactly two weeks to the day and two nails are completely lifting. One from the bottom and the other from the side. I had to go to another nail Shop to reshape them because I couldn't do the wide square shape. Typically when I get my nails done, they last 3 almost 4! Weeks without a problem.",-1,-1
"Do not waste your money. Plain and simple. No attention to detail, did a gel manicure in 25 minutes. Turned out awful. Had a bad feeling when I walked in, should have listened to myself. Also they could really step up the cleanliness. I would be afraid of the germs in there!",-1,-1
"Horrible Experience!  My wife went into this salon for the first time to get a gel manicure. The tech was friendly but that same night it was peeling (usually lasts 2 weeks) While she was getting her nails done she asked the tech about her eye lashes as the lady she was seeing took a break from doing lashes. The tech said she got her lashes done there. ($80)  Two days later she returned to have them ""fix"" the gel manicure, rather then removing it the correct way they ripped all 4 layers off and painted over them. Which caused them to peel that night again.  The day she was in to get her nails fixed she got her lashes done. The lady was very unprofessional, not wearing gloves, and seeming rushed. The result was so bad. At the end of the day she had clumps of lashes falling out, her whole left eyelid was missing 1/3 of the lashes. She lost over 1/2 the lashes by the end of the night, and the glue was so clumpy that she could not see. ($80)  My wife is a Nurse and she works in the NICU where she has to be able to see. She had to schedule a removal from a profesional eyelash company to have the lashes professionally removed. ($25)  In total she spent $185. We called the next day and went to explain the issue. The manager was a joke, said that there was nothing he could do, and they do not offer any refunds. We asked for $50 back and said that was fair, to which he laughed, took 3 days to reply, and did not give any resolution.   Please be warned that while they are nice, and the salon is clean, they should not be offering services such as lashes or gel manicures.",-1,-1
HORRIBLE service. Soaked my feet in tub for 45 minutes unattended. Take on more customers than they can accommodate. Rude. Just had to leave.,-1,-1
"I went here on the basis of the reviews on yelp, after all, it's never steered me wrong before! My friend and I went here to get pedicures and how I wish we wouldn't have. While the place seemed clean, it was dead for a weekend (that should have been my first hint). Two guys did our pedicures. My friend got a basic color and I asked for a design from one of their pictures that were in the book on the table. Well my friends toes were cut in a ""u"" shape, dipping down in the middle and high on the sides-she was so confused, had the guy ever given a pedicure before? My design looked anything like the picture and ended up looking more like jail stripes than the cute summer chevron I had asked for. When it was time to pay my bill was more than what the sign said, but I never received a breakdown, looking back I probably should have asked, but we were meeting my mom after and needed to go.  Flash forward, my second toe on each foot has been bothering me since the pedicure... saw a medical professional and they told me the place gave me a staff infection as well as an ingrown toenail. Y'all a STAFF INFECTION! I have been getting pedicures my whole life and never experienced anything like this. I'm new to the area and was just looking for a new place to get my nails did... Don't go to this place! Please find somewhere else, the pain and aggravation isn't worth it- you don't want this!",-1,-1
"Second time I give this place ""the benefit of doubt"" and once again, I leave so disappointed.   Their staff is not very friendly and the guy that did my acrylic nails left them way too short and pointy.   As if all that was not enough I was charged $46 dollars for a job that anywhere else you would pay at least $10 less.  I don't mind paying extra for quality and friendliness, however this place has neither.",-1,-1
"Let me start by saying this is not a bad review about the staff. The staff was very friendly and helpful and joyful.  Here's the problem with this location. They have it set up ""Cafeteria Style"" which is VERY confusing and uncomfortable. At normal St. Louis Bread Company's (I'm from St. Louis which is where Panera started, so I know my Bread Co. lol) you go to the register, order your food and then they call your name. At this location, you go to one side of the counter, a person takes your order on a piece of paper, then you grab your number and your tray and make your way down the cafeteria line and the staff start putting food on your tray if it's ready. Then you make your way to the end and pay for your food.  All-in-all, the service is friendly and fine, but the process needs major improvement. It needs to be simple and easy to order and receive the food.",-1,-1
"Our server was nice but sadly the food was just ok.  We ordered the following dishes:  Bone marrow: the bone marrow was good but the crostini that came with it was stale, old and chewy it was so hard to chew. We asked if it's suppose to be crunchy because most crostini are and the server says I honestly don't know ................ Well she went to go and ask the cook if they can make the crostini crunchy.... They did but she only came out with two pieces.... Reallllllyyyyy there's two of us and we have two big Bones with bone marrow... Well she At least she tried.  Butter chicken and halfsies: hmmm it's a wanna be chicken curry with undercooked soupy rice........  Pork belly Mac: the pork belly was good sadly the skin was soggy from the cheese sauce.. The pasta was over cooked. The idea of the dish was pretty cool though.  Steak frites: if you want steak in your butter order this you'd love it!",-1,-1
"I have contemplated whether to write this.  It has gnawed at me.  Ten days ago we ate at the tavern.  Sitting outside. Beautiful setting. Very nice. As tables turned over, the tables were cleaned. At one table, the cloth used to wipe the tables was dropped on the ground.  Seminal moment. Rather than immediately replace the cloth, the cloth was picked up and put back on the table and the wiping continued.  I immediately remove my hands from the table and didn't want to touch anything.     What hope does one have that kitchen staff are trained any better?  Foundation of any food establishment is proper cleanness training.  So sad as the the food tasted good. Yikes!",-1,-1
"4 of us stopped here before a play for dinner. The menu looked interesting and a bit creative online. We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly. Maybe she was new, but she was unable to answer some of our questions about the beverage and food menu.  Our dinner was served in a timely manner. We all agreed, it was very average at best.  We decided to share some type of cheesecake dessert. It was definitely prepackaged and tasted like a refrigerator, yuk!  A cute place, but the food quality was just not there.",-1,-1
"Two of our very good friends, my husband, and I wanted a night out at a new Madison eatery.  It was a Sat. night without reservations.  Thankfully we found a spot at the bar and enjoyed a few beverages before dinner.  The bartender offered samples and suggestions to the various beers we were interested in.  My husband has Celiac, several options were present.  Yes, the variety and knowledge of beverages was exceptional but the food was lacking.   My husband ordered the pork chop, it came out (too) rare and was sent back.  They comped us for this thankfully.  My girlfriend and I ordered the chicken curry dish.  The chicken was tender but extremely salty!  It was if they had brined the chicken over night.  The curry sauce was very comfort food yummy.  I know it's a European/Canadian thing to have gravy covered fries but I'm not a fan.  Our friend ordered the mussels and loved them!   We shared desserts of Creme Brulee - Delish!!!  and chocolate cheese cake (i think) - dry and blah Not a fan of the menu, or options (too few).  Like i read in previous reviews, i 'd go for drinks but not the food.",-1,-1
"cool place, food was ok... not great not terrible. Mussells were bland, despite the waitress doing a great job explaining how they are prepared... that cool egg , wrapped in meat and deep fried was fun, different and the mustard sauce was special.. we are a larger group so tried a lot... pretzel sticks were tasty.. service fair.. almost got 3 stars but not quite, and i would not rush back....",-1,-1
"I'll preface this review by stating that I was here with a large group and I understand how those can be a challenge for a restaurant. Still, it never ceases to amaze me how restaurants can understaff when they know well in advance that they have a large party coming. There must've been at least 50 patrons in the upstairs room and the restaurant only had two servers for the entire group. To put it in perspective, we arrived at 7 PM and started ordering from the limited menu chosen by the restaraunt. It was 9:15 PM before we finally received our entrÃ©es. Everyone in our party was so ready to leave, that we simply skipped dessert.  The waitstaff, who were obviously overwhelmed, were simply just blah. Maybe they figured they had their mandatory tip for large parties sewed up and no extra effort was necessary.  As far as the food goes, well it was average at best. There was not one item on the preselected menu that I found appetizing. I pleaded with my waitress to let me just get a hamburger and she refused. Honestly, I should've gotten up and walked downstairs and ordered a hamburger   Avoid this place unless mediocrity is what you seek.",-1,-1
"Pros: Cool atmosphere. Great beer/drink selection. Fun location.  Cons: We waited forever for a table. There's no good waiting space. We ordered a cheese plate and it was sooooo sad. The presentation was terrible. Our friend ended up with a terrible case of food poisoning from their Flank Steak ""special"".  I like this place for the drinks and their patio is lovely when the weather is good. But...I don't think I'll ever return for the food.",-1,-1
"I came to Cooper's Tavern today with high hopes! Last time I went, the food and service was great. Today, I wouldn't know if the food was great because I never got it. Well, I got my iced tea and my friend got her frites(which are rather tasty), but after almost an hour after ordering sandwiches, we asked for a check for just the drinks and frites because we just wanted to leave. This was maybe the third time we spoke to our waitress? I don't remember her name, but she is a short redhead. Very unfriendly, and never managed to actually put our order in. After asking for the check, she came back out and said it was on the house and we were free to go, confirming that our lunch order had never actually been put in. We both left pretty pissed off. I won't be going back any time soon.",-1,-1
Awful food. Horrible date place. Too loud. Beer list rarely changes. This is the place you go to to break up with someone.,-1,-1
"Good beer, BUT bad, bad food. Had horrible poutine - which is sad considering that Wisconsin cheese curds should have been the bomb but instead were rubbery and tasteless. Tomato red pepper soup was inedible, salads were anemic. Everything else was microwaved and/or canned. Bills itself as a gastropub, but instead gave me gastroenteritis...",-1,-1
"I heard a lot about the place from the local people and were real excited to try it out.   for appetizer, we ordered the sconnie egg. The meat was dry and quite honestly it is tasteless. They tried to add flavor by putting a lot of the mustard source on the bottom but it is too salty. I think it would have worked better with a different kind of mustard. We had the Poutine as well. This is a dish that is gaining its popularity here in the US. The fries and gravy are good but the cheese are sticking together but overall it is a B+.  As for dinner we ordered the hamburger. The meat was tough. Hands down The Old Fashion is a lot better. The up side there are a big selection of beer and it is a cool place just to hang out for a pint or two with no food please.",-1,-1
"Okay, I feel guilty for giving this place only two stars because it seems like a four star place on paper but.........  So the menu is great, but the food quality is very inconsistent.  I have tried  almost half the menu and have ordered the same item (brisket sandwich for one) on different occasions and had very different results!!  The pretzels and cheese are a decent app.  The fish fry is solid.  As for everything else well, ehhhh.  The wait staff is always very friendly, but the knowledge of the menu and the beer list is not where it should be.  The menu isn't that complicated and at times the staff doesn't seem to have a very in-depth knowledge of the items.  The shotgun style lay-out isn't great for large groups, but if it's just you and a few buddies, this is a great place to go and tip a few.  Hopefully as they become more established, the consistency will come and this place will turn into a madison staple!  It has the potential!!",-1,-1
"I've eaten at The Cooper's Tavern many times in the past couple of years... I've definitely noticed a decline in the level of service. My husband and I ate here this evening at the bar. The bar staff ignored us for most of the evening. We had to flag staff down to ask for waters on two separate occasions. After my husband finished his beer, he waited at least half an hour to get a water.   The food definitely isn't good enough to make up for the poor service. It wasn't busy-- one of the bartenders even had time to pull their phone out and text for a few minutes.",-1,-1
"Was very disappointing in this place. I ordered one of the white pizzas and it was flavorless. The risotto balls and salad were just ok. Service was extremely slow. My waitress took my glass of water to fill and never returned it. I noticed other customers coming in, and then leaving because they were never attended to.",-1,-1
"I have been on a quest to find great Pizza, unfortunately this is not.  I gave it one stars because it did have flavor but the crust is chewy and it reminded me of pita bread Not good. You can't pick a slice up with your hands. If you like Napoletana pizza this might be ok although I have never been to Naples.  I haven't been to the Henderson location but I didn't think it will be much better.  Everyone has an opinion and we all have our own taste.  The reviews that were 5 stars I can't for the life of me understand why unless they don't know great pizza.  Chicago and New York have great pizza and I will continue to search. ( Check this one off the list)",-1,-1
"This place had such potential. Good location. Nice ambiance. But we have had a couple of bad experiences now and won't be going back.  1. There is no pepperoni. 2. Their salads taste like a pine tree and not in a good way.  3. The service was really slow. We finally got out of there after 2 1/2 hours. We went on a weekend night and there were only a few other people dining, but we were not attended to very well. There were multiple waiters but refills were neglected.  4. The pizza just wasn't that great. Project pie, Grimaldis, biaggios, and other pizza places in Vegas are a lot better.  5. The waiter had a difficult time splitting the checks.  6. We both got sick from what we ate and had stomach issues all night. TMI We will not be going back. But in all fairness, if you still want to try it, at least they have coke products and their bathrooms are nice.",-1,-1
This quite possibly was the worst pizza I ever had. I cannot wrap my head around how this place has such good reviews. I ordered the bolognese pizza and the settebello. Took 40min to get pizza first off. The bolognese was disgusting. It was like eating soup pizza. Was basically raw dough in the middle. I had one slice of the bolognese and was done. The settebello was raw in the middle as well but not as bad as the bolognese. The waitress said the pizza was soft but I was not expecting raw pizza. Just a horrible texture. Bring your spoon to eat your pizza at this place.,-1,-1
"Pizza was okay. Luke warm at best. Logan took my order over the phone and messed up my order and also put me down under a completely different name. He didn't bother apologizing and was overall apathetic at best. Logan: you seem lazy and like you don't like your job- maybe you should get a new one and new attitude. Trish the manager should have corrected him on the spot, she was too busy sitting down socializing at a nearby friend. I guess business is good enough here that anything goes in this place.  I don't know if I'll be back here.",-1,-1
I have been to this place three times and each time the service has gotten worse not better. Today they advertise five dollar pizza and they will claim they charged us 12 each  I asked for balsamic vinegar and waited 30 minutes I will give this place one more try,-1,-1
"A large group of us visited here for the first time and were not that impressed. The restaurant itself was nice as was the service. We ordered a number of things including three different salads, a bruschetta appetizer and three different pizzas. The salads and appetizer were solid. The pizza was a letdown. The dough was very flimsy and seemingly undercooked. The toppings were okay but the pizza itself was almost room temperature. If we ever return we will be sure to ask for the pizza to be cooked well done.",-1,-1
"The Margherita pizza at this place tasted so close to what we had in Napoli. I have been looking for a spot, where I can have an authentic Napoletana pizza and this place came really close. Although, the middle part of the pizza was a little soft and soggy and the crust was slightly burnt, which added a bitter taste to the pizza. I can overlook those tiny flaws.   However, I cannot overlook the non-attentive or shall I say non-existent server. We're not in Italia so I didn't expect the customer service to be lacking. Once the server got our order, we never saw the server again. We needed extra napkins and more water, but there was no sign of the server anywhere. There was a few people on the other side of the room that looked like they work there, but it was a bit awkward to flag them down since they were preoccupied with their conversations. There were only two other tables with customers along with ours and we were all pretty much ignored. The server came back when we were done with our food and at that point, we got the bill.  I don't think I'll be coming back here when I'm in Vegas?! It's such a shame since the pizza was so good.",-1,-1
The pizza bolognese wasn't anything out of the ordinary the pizza crust was thin but not crisp it was a bit soggy and the taste was okay. We also got the only pasta available it had bits of asparagus nothing special there isn't a lot of variety. Service was good.,-1,-1
"I came here about a week ago with my baba because Archie's was booked full and the overall experience at this place was very blah.  We came during the lunch rush and the place wasn't very busy. They're understaffed (3 people) and the 2 waiters and 1 waitress were dressed very inappropriately for work. In all honesty I thought they were customers themselves.  When we walked in the host tried to sit us at a high table with high chairs even though my father walks with a cane... I was shocked that this boy couldn't use common sense.  The waitress as very slow at getting us anything we needed and quite rude when we questioned her as to why she took 12 minutes to take our bill so she could run the card.  We both got the lunch special. My father got the panzenella salad with the settebello pizza and I got the beet salad with the diavola pizza. Both salads were very underdressed and dry. The pizzas where also lacking in flavor, depth and the crust was overcooked and chewy. I won't be coming back here but if you want to try it by all means go ahead. Nothing ventured nothing gained!",-1,-1
"Been here three times, seems to be getting worse each time. I wish they could make a crispy pizza! The salads are under seasoned but not bad.",-1,-1
Do not rent there !!!!!!! Beware of these crooks.They will charge you for damages that dont exist!tThey don't notify you but they will say they did and then they turn it over to a collection agency and three months later you get a call saying you owe 800$.Before you move out make sure you do a pre move out inspection!,-1,-1
"On the outside, this place looks great! When you call, expect no answer. Not sure if the two numbers listed were both wrong, but could not get in touch. Makes me think the management is a bit short staffed, so what else could they be short on in providing to those who live there?  If I can ever get a response, I may change this review.",-1,-1
"Went here to get an eye exam for new contact lenses.   The eye doctor didn't like the Acuvue lenses I'd been wearing for the last ten years, and pushed me to try a different kind.   They never felt comfortable, but she said they would gradually feel better.   They never felt as good as my old ones, partially because she also didn't believe in using lenses especially for astigmatism, which I had always had before.   Granted, I should have protested more, but the end result was that I paid $150 for an eye exam and got a prescription for contacts that I never used.   It was a complete waste of money when I really didn't have any to spare.   I don't know if she got a bigger kickback from the makers of the contacts she wanted me to have or what, but it was a terrible experience.   Eventually, I did call and ask if they could write me the same prescription but for Acuvue lenses but was told that they couldn't do that without the doctor seeing how they were on my eyes.   Ultimately, I've ended up using my last pack of 2-week acuvue disposables for a couple months for each set of lenses until I can afford another, more reputable, eye exam.",-1,-1
"I read in the local paper that Wu Hu is a new noodle shop at the Silverton. So me and my wife finally got an opportunity to go check it out.   We both had the soup of the day, which was wonton soup; it looked beautiful when it came out the kitchen.  The entrÃ©es we had were General Tso chicken with white rice & chow mein noodles with BBQ pork. As all the food looked amazing, it was a complete different case when eating it; the food was completely plain and it didn't have any the flavor.  In my own personal opinion,  I feel like the restaurant can use a few changes. When I first arrived, I thought this was a sit down restaurant, but it was  not. You go to the counter to order then find a table to sit yourself. You also get your own utensils and fill up your own drink, etc. For the price and atmosphere this place gives off, I feel like a hostess and maybe some waiters can definitely make feel this place as a sit down restaurant. Honestly, to have spent this much money for basically a drive thru place is a bit much for nothing. Also, the appetizer/soup came out after our meals, which is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. The food came out way too fast; I mean the food was out by the time we sat down. I understand some people do not like to wait for their food, but I don't want to feel like I'm being rushed out.   I feel like this can be a great place to eat. It has a great location, their atmosphere looks great,  but I hope the next time I try it, the food will be better.",-1,-1
"Was super excited to eat here as I was craving some pad thai... After waiting for over 10 minutes to place my order (when there was less than 5 ppl ahead of me), I finally ordered at 12:58pm... Waited along with at least five other people who placed their orders either right before or after me to get my food. After witnessing tables not getting the things they asked for, and not one to-go order being processed in about 20 minutes, I decided to give them a few more minutes and allow 30 minutes before I cancelled my order. At 1:35 I asked for my order to be cancelled and refunded. I will say, some of the food orders looked pretty decent that were being delivered to the tables, over 30 minutes for a to-go order of some noodles is excessive. No apology from the staff for having multiple guests waiting that long for what should have been an easy order.",-1,-1
WoW...just bad and overpriced...they saved themselves a 1 because Asian is my comfort food and I haven't vomited yet .  Pho was bland...duck was old and reheated...kung pao was bland...the rice was old and soggy as was the noodles in the Pho.  The duck bao was amazingly good and I feel very tricked.  Ok...I live walking distance and would not let a limo drop me off for a comped meal.   Just plain Ew...,-1,-1
"This place advertises itself as a Noodle House. Because it was 108 degrees outside, I didn't feel like eating hot noodles and/or soup. I ordered the BBQ Combination. For an in a casino food court the presentation is nice. The quality and quantity of food provided was disappointing. It was dry and tough. As compared to Chinatown and factoring the bland unimpressive taste and meager portions, the price would not appeal to the value conscious crowd. But compared to the other eating establishments in this casino food court, the price is on par, about 10 to 12 dollars per plate.   Remember this review is based on the BBQ offerings not the noodles. I assume they should be better.   I do have a concern over the layout. There are to many tables that are too tightly packed. One has to turn sideways as you zigzag between them. They are very high tables with stools with exposed sharp corners.  Only one table is at a height that can be accessed by wheelchair persons. Unfortunately, it's located in the busiest and least accessible part of the restaurant. The path is obstructed by a gauntlet of tables, stools and people standing in line to place their orders. I saw a girl with her mother and brother park the wheelchair under the table because that table was inaccessible. Luckily, she was both strong and light enough that her two companions were able to assist her into a high stool.   Strangely, eating utensils are the customers responsibility of getting from a hidden corner in the front. I would say it was the most frequently asked question I overheard.   There is a bottomless fountain service for drinks, yeah. But with the slick flooring and lack of any anti-slip matting. It is literally an accident waiting to happen. In the half hour I've been here I saw one of the employees or owners, Linda, almost do a face plant.   I'm looking  forward to trying the noodles in this place  the next time I'm trapped at Silverton. But nothing I've seen induces me to give up my usual noodle spots, Mr. Noodle or Thai Style Noodle House.",-1,-1
"Waited 18 minutes for shrimp fried rice. The menu says green onions, eggs, and shrimp. No green onions and its full of peas and carrots...yuck. I ordered cause they weren't listed as part of the dish. The shrimp is a little too mushy for my taste and the fried rice has NO flavor at all...like plain white rice. Never again.",-1,-1
"Salt and pepper pork, sweet and sour pork and noodle soup were well done. The spring rolls are excellent. The downside is it is not even close to being wheelchair accessible or ADA compliant. Code enforcement severely lacking.  Eating there again on 8/18 and they were busy and no one to bus tables. No less than 9 tables were full of dirty dishes for over 30 minutes. We stacked them for them but still not removed for some time. This was only done when we insisted after our food order was delivered and placed among the dirty dishes. Then 15 minutes later we had to chase them down to get the last 2/3 or our order.",-1,-1
"Ordered the BBQ combination and got cold rice that was hard and tasted like it was from the bottom of the rice cooker , was so hungry I didn't complain but made a review instead",-1,-1
"Not impressed at all.. In fact wish we didn't choose this one. Crab Ragoon - it had so much curry in it, that's all you could taste. The Mongolian Beef - flavor was there, but the beef was chewy! All in all - yuck!",-1,-1
Very disappointed got there to order at 8:48pm they were still cooking and place is suppose to be open til 9pm.  Yet they refused to take my order and another person walked up and refused them too.  You have set hours so why not keep them I could understand if nobody was cooking still but your chefs were still cooking.,-1,-1
"Worst experience of Vegas we Order our food some of it came our Kung pao chicken didn't we tried getting our money back they just cancelled the order not the transaction one of the cooks is the one that could do it he just scream ""not now too busy"" food was flavor less too expensive for the taste. We will never be coming back to this place. One star cause you can't post without stars!!",-1,-1
"Slow service and the food taste like it came from their buffet. Better off going to Panda Express, lol",-1,-1
"This is a food court establishment inside a casino, and the food is merely above Panda Express level. I was very disappointed at the menu. The roasted duck was over roasted.",-1,-1
"I ordered the pho and the broth was extremely bland, and the food took 40 minutes to come out. The one good thing was the pork belly buns.",-1,-1
"Dear Cooper, I had higher hopes for you after viewing your menu online. I had higher hopes for you after walking into your space, obviously channeling what you thought was a gastropub but turned out to be just another pub with flavorless food. Why, Madison, why are you so afraid of flavor?!   Is that why the Jameson I ordered was so huge? (Thank you!) Is that why your beer list is so extensive and diverse? (Thank you again.) Because you expect your patrons to get well elixed before the food arrives? Let me tell you, the flavors of the food does NOT hold up to the flavors of your drinks.   I suppose I should have known not to order a Italian dish (polenta) off of a mostly Irish menu. It was not only bland, it was very hot. But not out of the pan hot, out from under the heat lamp / out of the microwave hot. I see you Cooper's, and it ain't nearly as hot as your food. My friend had the mac and cheese with pork belly on top. The mac and cheese, aside from the topper, was dull. So so dull. Not even as flavorfull as Annie's out of the box. Find the salt, it's on a shelf, about head high. And oh my lord this pork belly was awful tasting, when it wasn't chewy and tasteless. Neither dish was 1/2 finished when we were finished.   Drinks, people. This place is good for drinks and atmosphere and frites.",-1,-1
"First the up side.  They have an amazing beer list, which features a wide range of styles, regions and tastes.  The server was attentive and responsive.  The item I ordered was a Cobb salad featuring corned beef, which turned out to be little more than an accent with about six very small cubes each measuring a quarter inch in diameter.  I guess I wrongly assumed that when you include a specific meat in the name of an entree salad, that it would have ""star billing"".   One of the other diners ordered a reuben sandwich and cup of reuben soup, each of which required no less than three beers to quash the residual salty taste.  I will probably take a chance at lunch, but if that is as unsatisfactory an experience, I will have no problem finding other places to patronize in downtown Madison.",-1,-1
"We ordered the poutine. No gravy and was flavorless! Beer pretzels were gross!!! Ran out of Caesar dressing so couldn't get a salad. Bottom line, don't come here for the food. Just the beer and cute wait staff.",-1,-1
"I have to say my husband and I were very unhappy with what we experienced at Cooper's Tavern. The first time we went was during brunch. Our thought was if it is on the square you would think that it has to have something good going on. Well.........apparently not. We went in and they asked us if it was our first time dining there and we told them no, now one would think that since it was our first time and they knew it they would give us a ""good show"" We ordered our drinks that did not show up till the end of our meal which I asked several times where they were, the food was bland and we had to pay for the drinks! If they had good customer service they would've said ""the drinks are on us."" Did I mention that they weren't busy?!?! I emailed later that night and was told they got new servers and just give it another go. Well like dummies we did. The second time the service was better but the food was crap. I ordered the Reuben and I literally couldn't chew the meat! It was like eating a tire. My husband got the brisket sandwich which consisted of fatty meat. NEVER AGAIN!",-1,-1
"Unimpressed.  My husband and I walk in and a very polite man tells us there is no room on this floor, to either go upstairs or downstairs.  Um, k?  We go upstairs and are seated immediately.  No one comes by for our drink order for forever, the girl who finally does knows nothing.  The menu has something about a beer of the month.  I ask her what is this, to which she responds 'I don't know, it changes every day, I don't think we have one."" Uhhhh huh.  My husband and I ordered cheese curds from her before reviewing the menu, just assuming they had some, and we were brought fries with cheese and gravy.  They were good enough, but not at all cheese curds.   Now a guy finally comes by and says he's our waiter.  He goes on a rant about how they have NO specials (it's a Friday night).  Our friend wanted fish so questions him.  He is flustered and a bit rude to her, she only wanted to know if there was some kind of Friday night fish.  Geez sorry dood.  Guess you don't like tips.   My pork belly mac was meh.  Would have been better if they just skipped the pork all together and just made it a vegetarian mac and cheese dish.  My husbands rueben had waaaaaaaaay too much meat and not nearly enough of anything else.  He was disappointed.   1 star for accommodating our friend with Celiac.  1 star for sparking a fun conversation about how much to tip for sub par service.",-1,-1
"I've been for brunch couple of times, and the experience was nothing to write home about at best, or just bad.  Pros:  -Staff is extremely nice, has a good sense of humor -Great beer selection -Bloody Marys are good, reasonably priced Large, well-placed TV screens  Cons: -Service was slow - my friend's mimosa was comped because it took so long to get -We were near the end of brunch (I think), and there were three different menu items that we wanted, that they had run out of. If you don't have it, let us know before we make up our minds to order -The Steak & Eggs were cold within a couple of minutes, the steak was tough, and the sauce tasted strangely chlorine-y (or soap-y?). They had run out of their duck-fat eggs, and for $15 the dish was bland -Coffee was mediocre, had to flag the server down for a refill",-1,-1
"I've eaten here twice and try not to go back.  I wish there were more decent dining options on the Square for entertaining out-of-town guests...  Anyway, the first time I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich.  I don't really like grilled cheese and only order them when there are no palatable meat-free options.  It was the usual mess of grease on bread.  The highlight was the shot of harvest soup, but again that was only a shot.    The second time we came here was because The Old Fashioned was too busy.  I was fine with that because I'm not a fan of their food, but my friends were visiting and were really excited about the variety of cheese curds.  To make up for the lack of cheese curds, we ordered the poutine.  Having traveled extensively in Canada, I can say this was a far cry from the original (true, we did get the gravy on the side).  The cheese was lumpy, waxy mess in the middle, and the fries were cold and soggy.  We didn't even finish them, and who doesn't finish their fries?!  I really liked the Venetian Manicotti, though the buckwheat crepe was rather grainy.  That could be the nature of buckwheat, I'm not sure.  I'd definitely order it again, especially if I come here with someone I don't want to talk to.  My friends all seemed reasonably pleased with their meals, though it was hard to tell because I couldn't hear a word they said.  Between the horrendous acoustics and multiple TVs (with the volume on!), my friends and I quickly learned any attempt at conversation was fruitless.  The whole meal made me feel sad and lonely, because I could see my friends but not talk to them.  It made us eat quickly and run out of there.  One positive note:  I think all the ambient noise mimicked the sounds of my friend's womb.  Her little baby slept through the whole meal.  It was quite nice for us grown-ups.  Too bad we couldn't talk to each other about how lovely it was to have adult conversation.  I don't drink beer, so I ordered a Magner's.  It came in a pint glass, which I'm sure would have been appreciated if I were an alcoholic or like to consume 1500 calories per meal.  I drank less than half of it.  It would be nice to have smaller portions, for those of us who don't like to feel the need purge upon dining.",-1,-1
"BEWARE!! They food poisoned me, I had 6 hours of agonizing pain, cold sweats, diarrhea and nausea.  I'm allergic to milk; no its not a sensitivity or lactose intolerance, it's a full on allergy. I made the waitress aware, even though I triple checked with her and sent my food back when I saw it had a dairy based dressing on it, they still managed to poison me. They put cheese in my sandwich and it was melted in so I couldn't see it until I was 3/4 through it.  When I found out I alerted the waitress and she spoke with the owner. The coward hide in the back and they told her to give me the sandwich for free. Gee thanks a free $10 sandwich in exchange for 6 hours of hell.   Sure not everyone has an allergy and I deal with this a lot. But think on this, if they don't take a potentially life threatening situation seriously, what else don't they take seriously? Food safety, cleanliness? Who knows..   Food safety is serious and it's important for everyone, we can all get food poisoning. Don't eat here, the owner clearly doesn't care if their patrons are hurt by their food.",-1,-1
"I wanted to like this place.  I really really did.  We decided to visit after seeing that they had a unique take on different meals.  The service was okay and the prices were decent. The restaurant was very packed and a bit on the ""packed like sardines"" side.  The food was again just okay but I really expected more.  The beer selection was great.  Unfortunately, the deal breaker would be the mild food poisoning that the two out of the 3 of us received.  The other guest received a pretty bad case of it (they ordered the fish and chips fyi)  My suggestion would be to stick with the beer or not go at all.",-1,-1
"The dough (crust) comes out burned/charred. I am OK with the tasteless tomato sauce some people mention, I actually like sauce like that. Some other pizzerias just add too many spices in the sauce and I don't like it.  But why, or why? Why do you burn the crust like that. Please, don't tell me that's how oven baked or wood fired pizza should be. I've tried them all and the crust should NOT be so burned. Check out my photos. It was so bad, my kids did not want to eat the pizza, in the end they ate only the mid secrion of it.   The pizza is very thin. The sauce and cheese are light. Toppings tasted good. These are all food things. That's why I give it 2 stars.  Other bad things - other parts of the pizza were slightly burned as well and the toppings were unevenly spread.  Please, fix your ovens or replace them.",-1,-1
"The Good:  Our server was really nice and attentive as well as everyone else who helped her out.   The Bad:  Everything lacked flavor from start to finish. Our app the Bruschetta was horrible, from the taste and texture to the balsamic that was ""artistically"" swirled in the center.   The pizza I ordered which was the Vico didn't have enough toppings...basically a white pizza with horrible inconsistent cuts of onions, and maybe a toddlers handful of meat...no joke! The meat on the pizza was less than 1/4 of a cup.   The canoli was by far the worst canoli I've ever had. Paula Dean couldn't even save this dish.   The Worst:  Both pizzas were under cooked. Either the chef really didn't care because we walked in 35 minutes before close or because a group of 6+ walked in 20 minutes before close or because he was too occupied making sure what looked like his family was having a better meal than anyone else.   I see and hear people rave about this place. Regardless of the friendly waitstaff, I wouldn't return due lack of flavor, lack of originality and inability to make something so simple as pizza cook properly.",-1,-1
"OMG people would you stop acting all knowing about food and this is real Italian pizza and all that crap. It's dry it's boring it's tasteless it's not happy, the whole idea of pizza is gone with this one. There are way better places.  And it gets cold in twenty seconds.   No good",-1,-1
"The food is delicious! If I was just judging the quality of food and flavored this review would be very different... That being said the service is awful. So inattentive and unapologetic it's hard to want to go back for the delicious pizzas. An early dinner with friends turned into a two and a half hour debacle of some of the worst service I've ever had. Order to go, and enjoy the meal in your own home. Or make sure when you go you have all the time in the world and the patience of a saint.",-1,-1
"Overall this place is just plain and just OK. The atmosphere is good, the service was good, but the food is sub-par. I imagine it's fine for happy hour but otherwise I don't think the pizza and salad is good.",-1,-1
The worse pizza I have ever had hands down. Dough taste like a tortilla no flavor on pizzas at all. And maybe it's just me but I'd never have canned tomatoes and bags for flour as a display in any restaurant I work in. The one star is for the warm beats those were not bad teach the cooks to season better and they'd be good,-1,-1
Went into little lunch there today had a horrible service we did at least a good 10 minutes until someone greeted our table it was completely dead nail drops and the server finally came Got our drinks didn't come back for another 10 minutes to take our order. The pizza was limp and not crispy all the way through.....so u can understand when u grab a piece and everything falls off because the center is not cooked all the way....my salad that came out first had line pine nuts that I asked to take off still came to the table with them....had to remake the salad and our pizza took about 20 min to come out. Clearly the girl during the day that was working  should take a pen and paper to the table for orders. The place was dirty and should be closed down for horrible food and service!!!  Work on that and maybe you have a chance!,-1,-1
Worst pizza ever had...please don't go waste your money...I did....Their calzone is not good either..It's just flat..Flavors are weird..They just put olives on the pizza without cutting them....I wouldn't even rare it 1 star,-1,-1
"This place was OK. I came here recommended by a friend and brought along 3 other friends. The pizza was mediocre. I can honestly say Metro Pizza has WAY better pizza than this place. Our server was cool, Even though it took him 10 years to get my friend her long island ice tea drink. I was dissapointed when we ordered the bruschetta. It ONLY came with 2 pieces on a HUGE platter and we paid $9 for it. One was bigger than the other and the smaller one was burnt. I don't think it was worth the price but it was still good. The platter it was on looked like it could have came with 4 or 5 pieces total. Wasn't too hyped up about this place. I don't think I'll come back.",-1,-1
"My wife and I frequent Settebello because of it's close proximity to our office and the exceptional food/service we've received in the past. However,  today was not one of those days. We arrived begore the typical lunch rush at noon and were seated. The new waitres was obviously frazzled already. We oredered our usual lunch special - two pizzas and two salads for $22. The new girl then informed us we could not order what we wanted, even after we assured her that we would pay the difference for the additional toppings like we have everytime in the past. She got offended and told us the other girl (the usual waitress that has served us for the last year or so) was fired and that ot was because of people like us modifying our order. We decided to stay and order the special and the side salads since we had already been served our drinks. Our salads finally came,  but by this time several other people had shown up for lunch. She must have been the only person hosting and waiting tables as it was pretty hard to get her attention. Our pizza came out of the oven and sat on the counter for several mintues before she came out of the back and finally cut it and brought it to our table. Sadly it was now cold, but had the promise of being a pretty tasty pizza. When we asked to settle up for the salad and drinks, and told her our pizza was cold she proceeded to walk over to the manager and tell him we didn't like the pizza and so the very nice man came over and gave us a free pizza coupon for our next visit. (But to be clear, no we actually thought the flavor was good, but eating a cold pizza was not to be desired and trying to flag down this waitress was very difficult). All in all kudos to the manager, he obviously cares about his customers, especially ones that come almost once  a week. I guess the other girl who used to work there was fired for being nice and accommodating to her customer, who knows,  I can only go by what the new waitress told us (who even says stuff like that to customers? ) but I can tell you that the service was terrible",-1,-1
"Customer service was great, the specialty pizza was had a good crust flavor and texture was what i expected, but the meatballs i ordered were hot on the out side, cold in the middle and very the fried risotto and sauce it came with was very bland and not propperly seasoned... so i doubt i will go back... for $50 pizza meal for two i believe pizza rock is a better choice.",-1,-1
"Absolutely terrible.  The hostess said the wait would be 30 minutes. After 40 minutes I decided to check on how many people were left ahead of us. My group didn't want to wait much longer. The hostess looked up my name and said two tables in front of us. 25 more minutes go by and I see three more groups seated.  Go check to see why we were skipped and then told there are FIVE more in front of you.  I explained what the other hostess told me.  No apology. Just a shoulder shrug. So the originally quoted 30 minute wait, would've been at least an hour and a half if we kept waiting.  I gave up just after an hour. Had I been told the truth of 8(!) more tables in front of us I would've only wasted half the time.  Either the hostesses intentionally lie or they can't count or estimate.",-1,-1
"Ambiance: A Food:        A Service:    D-  If you are looking for one tasty pizza Settobello just may be your place.  I dined here for the second time this past weekend and once again, while the food was superb the service is UTTERLY LACKING (which can ruin an otherwise great mean in my book.)  Myself and five friends gathered for a post-New Year's dinner.  We gave the server our entire order and our waters and iced teas made their way to the table.  About this time the fire alarm went off... and continued to go off.  Finally they asked everyone inside the restaurant to wait outside while they investigated further (kudos to them... I loved that they took this seriously and put guest safety first.)  After about 15 minutes out in the cold Las Vegas night we were allowed to come back inside.  The server came back to the table and basically said, ""I can't find your order and will need to put it back into the computer.""  Umm, okay, no big deal.  Though we found it strange that no one ever came by to address the fire alarm or simply say ""thanks so much for waiting outside, we know it's cold and really appreciate it"" or ""hey, it was a false alarm, fire department came and checked everything out... thanks for waiting.""  No, it was simply business as usual without one word about the incident.  A few minutes 5 of us receive our food... the 6th persons order is lost.  Again, no big deal since we have ordered a ton of food and we all prefer family style anyway.  About a quarter of the way through our meal one of the servers is trying to stock the shelf LOCATED ABOUT 2 INCHES from three of my friends (on the opposite side of the table) and continually asks my friends to please move so she can complete her side-work.  This is where they completely lose me.  Here we are, trying to enjoy our meal and we are being asked to constantly move/stand-up/shuffle our chairs so the server can complete her re-stocking of pizza boxes behind us???  We then ask for refills on all six of our drinks since NO ONE has re-addressed this since we originally sat down - and what really infuriated me the most about this particular incident is that there were SIX employees standing at the POS terminal chatting to one another!  I'm sorry, but as a manager I'm like HELL NO!  Either get to work or go home!!    In the end we paid our bill and gave 20% tip because our original server was somewhat decent.  But we did ask to speak to the General Manager about the evening.  A lady greeted us a few minutes later... we told our story and she said ""I completely understand and I would feel the same way, but I'm just the bar manager......""  In a nutshell, Settebello PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE focus on training and management of your employees.  You serve a fantastic pizza but this was my second experience at your restaurant and both times the service has really let me down (the first time wasn't much better but I was willing to give a second try.)",-1,-1
"Sad to give this 1 star review. I have dined at the Henderson location and loved it. I do live right behind the summerlin location so I thought ordering 2 pies to go was a great idea. Wrong! Crust was burnt and the center of the pie was super greasy and full of water? I returned the pies and watched the cook remake the pizzas his expression on his face was not pleased to make the pies again. Not only because I have been a chef in Las Vegas for 20 years but I could feel the heat blasting all the way by the counter. They need to learn how to control there fire. Burnt is not cooked!!!!! I expressed my concern that the thermostat on the pizza oven was passed 900 degrees and he said well the thermostat had been broken for years. Right then I knew my pizzas would come out the same they did the first time. At this point I was beyond younger and I just wanted to eat. I just felt cheated that they knew the oven was way to hit to cook the pies properly and just giving me a card for a ""free"" pizza was going to see me off to enjoy my burnt undercooked pizzas. Thank you settebello",-1,-1
"So, I ate here last night as part of the Madison Fair Share fundraiser dinner and my group was very excited. We paid $50 for our tickets which included 3 courses - each paired with a beer from One Barrel Brewing. What could be better than a menu that is hand crafted from local ingredients that were grown and brewed around Madison, right? Well, unfortunately for us it was a huge disappointment.   We had an appetizer that consisted of shredded cucumber, a rich buttery sauce, and nice pieces of bread. Very delicious and refreshing.  The first course was braised rabbit served on a bed of RPs fettuccine with a creamy mushroom and beer sauce. This was really delicious, especially whatever crispy things they put on top. The only complaint is that it was, at best, lukewarm when we received it. The beer was very delicious - an American Pale Ale.  The second course was where things went wrong. Strangely enough, they served us salad after the main course. It consisted of a pile of pickled vegetables, including pickled morel mushrooms, rhubarb, radish, and asparagus. It was served on a bed of greens with an ipa vinaigrette. Now, I was very excited about this dish at first - I LOVE pickled stuff. I thought the idea of pickled morels was very exciting and interesting. Unfortunately, everything about the dish was absolutely overwhelming and rather cringe worthy. The vinaigrette mixed with the pickling brine made our eyes water, the anise was confusing and disgusting (admittedly, this may be a personal preference, but we all disliked it), and the greens were overshadowed by all of this. I wish this had been A. served before the main dish, B. had fewer pickles OR a less intense vinaigrette, and C. had more greens to even it all out. The beer with this one was also a loser for us - but we don't like IPA, so that is hard to gauge.   The third and final course was a dessert consisting of a strawberry and rhubarb sauce, a key-lime curd, and a rather odd white puffy thing resembling a cham tort. None of us finished it. It was insanely sweet, the white puffy thing was kind of gross, and it was just not satisfying. The beer served with this was really rather ghastly as well - it was a wheat beer and it seriously tasted like cigarette ash. We each managed to take 2 or 3 sips to try and figure out what it was we were tasting, but after that couldn't take another drink. I would rather drink budweiser or old milwaukee, which is just about the worst insult I can give to a beer.  Final comments: I had a really delicious old fashioned (brandy, sweet), and the service was really great. The wait staff were really on top of things, and the owner was out there busting his butt, too. I will consider going back for their regular food some day, I just hope this poorly executed menu was a fluke rather than the norm. In the end, it helped support a group I think is doing really great things and I am happy I did it, I just wish it had been a little better.",-1,-1
"A 45 minute wait turned into a 70 minute wait.  No exaggeration. Food was adequate but nothing spectacular. Menu is very limited. Beer list was vast, but so are the beer lists elsewhere.   Far too small for large groups.  Couples should have no problems but groups of 4 or more will have to wait forever for a table. Very loud, probably due to the cramped environment. They do stand out a little from the normal Food Fight establishment but I doubt I'll be back.",-1,-1
"We ate here for the first time and the service was not good, the waitress was not friendly or helpful with the menu selection. We did not have the chicken on our salad we ordered with chicken, she didn't bring the baguette that was supposed to come with it, and the salad was not fresh. I would not recommend this place compared to other places I have eaten, it was terrible.",-1,-1
"I really wanted to enjoyed this place. I really want to enjoy every place I go to but this place made it hard. Initially we attempted to go to the Old Fashioned but there was a 45 minute wait and I am totally not about 'that life'.  The man suggested going to Coopers instead and I thought it was a good choice , at first.  They do have  an expansive beer selection and though I am far from a beer connoisser I found a rasberry one that I really enjoyed.    The food at this place is a little meh though.  We ordered an egg roll dish with mash potatoes and roast beef that was okay but it was deep fried and it's hard to go wrong with deep fried.  To combat that I ordered a salad.  The salad was fine but I would have preferred a little less salad dressing on it as the lettuce appeared to be wilted from all the salad dressing.  The man got mussels, he gets these everywhere now!  I don't think he wanted admit it but he did not like them that much.  He kept mentioning that they were okay but he wished they had more flavor.   All in all I would go back to this place, not to eat, but to try more beers on their menu.  It's kind of a shame because with more effort put into the food this place could be a real winner.",-1,-1
"My Bavarian Beer Stew was dry - I don't think it could be fairly called a stew because there was no liquid in it.  On the bright side I got to watch my dining partner eat the Sconnie Egg - and it tasted as delicious in my mind as it did in his mouth.  Beer - yup, lots. Friendly eager to please waiter who apologized when our entrees were delivered right along with our appetizers. Who's running the kitchen?",-1,-1
"I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel as though I'm performing a community service by urging others to avoid this place.  The beer selection:  It certainly seems robust, except for the fact that what you want is nearly guaranteed to have ""just run out.""  Nowhere else in town do I find it necessary to pick 3 beers when I sit down just to ensure they will actually have what I want stocked.  The food... yikes.  Well it's not cheap, for one thing.  Sandwiches run about 10 dollars each and come with only a small amount of (what looks like your standard grocery store bagged) spring mix greens or chips.  Frites are an option, for an extra $2 (!!!).  The standard dipping sauce for the fries is a malt vinegar aioli, which had the exact aftertaste of spoiled milk and received universally negative reviews from my dining companions.  Let's get to the main events:  My first entree was the pork belly mac.   Plating:  Messy, no appealing colors or garnish.  Pork belly was splash of dark on the light colored mac.  Boring.  The pork belly:  An incredibly small amount for $14, and ALL fat--no thin strip of delicious bacony meat as you'd normally expect.  It was also burned (properly cooked it's crisp, not charcoal) on both sides but lukewarm and gelatinous on the inside.    The mac:  Sauce was awful.  The dubliner cheddar in the sauce made for a grainy texture with very little flavor.  In fact at many times the dominant taste was flour... someone evidently needs to work on their roux.  You can't be making such a sub par cheese sauce in the CAPITAL OF WISCONSIN.  C'mon.  My next visit, I got the chicken sandwich. The chicken:  Rubbery on the inside, tough on the outside but with no sear whatsoever on this ""pan-seared"" chicken.  I'm not even sure how to achieve this texture... steaming? Microwaved?  The bread:  Toasted sourdough.  Half inch thick slices of hard, toasted bread saturated with butter or some kind of oil.  The thickness of the bread made it very difficult to eat.  Diagonal slices, please.  The roof of my mouth thanks you in advance.  The accoutrements:  While technically there, the bacon, avocado, butter lettuce and cheddar toppings were not present in sufficient quantity to contribute anything to the taste of the sandwich, really unfortunate; it was this combination of toppings that actually drew me to the sandwich.  The chipotle mayo added a nice hint of smokiness, and was the only positive part of the experience.  DESPITE the truly mediocre food, the service has been fantastic here every time I've gone.  The servers seem genuinely apologetic about the food and very knowledgeable about the beers they DO have that might be SIMILAR to what I actually wanted.  Suffice to say, I likely won't go back here again.  Maybe, just maaaybe for a beer if I'm joining friends, but when it comes to food you can do MUCH better literally anywhere else.",-1,-1
"We came here for an anniversary dinner with friends before a show at the Overture.  This was the second time we had been here, and thought it would be a good place to go with our friends.  We started out with the poutine, which was very good.  For the main, I chose the sweet corn Caesar salad, which sounded amazing.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  The corn relish was seemingly non-existent.  Corn was in the salad, but it didn't really seem like it was part of a relish.  The dressing was a poblano-caesar dressing, but I couldn't taste the poblano.  Overall, this was just a mediocre salad.  My wife and a friend each had the turkey sandwich.  They were impressed with the actual slices of turkey breast, and thought the sandwich was good.  Our friend's husband had the Reuben sandwich.  When the server set it on the table, I was surprised to see how dark the rye was, although the description did say it was a black rye.  The description was correct, but the blackness was due to it being burnt.  How this got past anyone as being acceptable to serve is beyond me.  The server said that it would be taken off the bill.  I think this place is OK if you are going for happy hour, because they do have a pretty good beer list and good appetizers.  However, I don't think we'll go here again.  There are much better choices in Madison and on the square.  Edit:  they didn't take the sandwich off the bill, just the one beer that he drank.  Again, I will not be going back.",-1,-1
"The brunch here did not do it for me. Everything felt heavy Heavy HEAVY. The English Muffin was a sponge. The eggs were dense. And my side of fruit was served on the plate with the hot components making for hot mushy strawberries. I feel like you need to be super hung over for this. On the plus side, we had a nice server and full cups of coffee at all times. I'd give this place another try for lunch or dinner.",-1,-1
"The plus: I had a delicious dinner of pretzel-crusted chicken with a hash made of brussels sprouts and squash.  The diappointments: Seating and service. Seating: I was part of a group of 10 that was seated in the ""snug,"" a little wooden cubby off the bar. The table would seat six appropriately, not 10, and the stools we sat on were low and uncomfortable. With ten people in there, the voices bounced off the sides and made for a loud and irritating space. What's more, every time someone needed to get out of the space to go to the bathroom, those at the table between them and the entrance to the snug needed to get up and step outside the space, then repeat when they returned. What a bad concept!  Service: The bartender, who served us through a window in one of the walls, seemed to rely on charm rather than knowledge or good service. I indicated that I was thinking about having the reisling with my dinner and asked if he thought that was a good pairing. His response was that it was good becuase red would be ordered with red meat. (If he thinks that's what makes a good wine pairing, he is really ignorant and should not work at a bar that serves only beer and wine!) It didn't matter, though, because I never got my wine. He spent at least five minutes telling us why separate checks might not be possible, then provided them anyhow.  (Either you do or don't -- make up your mind. Personally, I understand why a server would not provide separate checks and I would not have even asked, but someone else in the group did.) His recommendations of items on the menu seemed entirely based upon telling us about the awards that the pub had gotten. I was not impressed.  In addition, being served through a window at the end of the table meant that all food and drinks needed to be passed down the table to those of us at the other end; the same with dirty dishes/glasses. Annoying.  I was SO glad to leave that noisy, crowded, and poorly served place. I felt like I was bursting into freedom as I left the restaurant. A good piece of chicken does not make up for the unplesantness.",-1,-1
"Worst experience ever tonight! Came here for dinner at 9 p.m., we were told the late night menu started a bit early, which we found acceptable. We sat outside and ordered our drinks and food at the same time, roughly at 9:10 p.m. At 10 p.m. we were told our food was given to the wrong table with the exact same order and  ours would be here ASAP. As of right now, 10:25 p.m., we still have no food. Our food order was simple Reuben and a medium well burger, neither should take more than 25 minutes. To end it all, we still had to seek out our server to cancel our food, as we had to leave... and we got an apology and a bill for our drinks. Given our experience, I am surprised that they gave us a bill at all.    Thank you for the worst experience ever in 10 plus  years I've lived in Madison.",-1,-1
"I thought it would be a great place to not eat too much ""carb""age when I looked at the menu. The Reuben has a tiny bit of corned beef with two HUGE pieces of bread. The harvest soup was supposed to come with blue cheese, Which they gave me more when I asked for more. If you have a crappy palate, you'll like this place. They are all about that bread, that bread.",-1,-1
"I don't know why I keep trying. It's like the substandard relationship that won't quit.   Their beer selection is outstanding. The decor is good. The service is alright. But the food, on the three occasions I've had it, has been very disappointing. I would not recommend the pretzel breadsticks, the reuben (salty and dry), or the poutine (neither authentic or good). I did like the pork belly mac and cheese, although I, for the first time in my life, ate *around* the pork belly once I tasted it. I didn't actually know that pork belly could be prepared in a manner that I wouldn't like. So at least it is an educational experience.  Lesson: Stick to the beers. And maybe a scotch egg. That thing is kinda good.",-1,-1
"This place is a heart attack in a box. Waygu everything..bacon..cheese..fried. How about a simpler chicken breast, a turkey sandwich or a non aggressively fat burger choice?  Even the salads were loaded with cheese and/or lardons.",-1,-1
"Aveda fan but disappointed in this salon  I was scheduled (scheduled weeks ago) to have an appointment with one stylist. They even confirmed right before the visit. When I arrived, I was told a different stylist would be taking me but no one could tell me why. I wish I had not spent 10 minutes on the phone discussing my hair and what I needed so they could find me the 'perfect person' -since they gave me someone random anyway. Linda was very nice, but the haircut was uneven and the color was very streaky.  All Aveda salons try to push their products, but this was the worst. (They put together 4 or 5 ""suggested"" products in a basket and bring it to the station. Linda didn't push the products but the cashiers were relentless. They also cheaped out the validating so I had to pay half my parking. Either validate or don't, that's my opinion anyway. I won't be back. Maybe I am just cranky because my hair came out so poorly.",-1,-1
"Ha!  Never heard you call today!  So much for ""trying to make it right""!  Like I said before, this salon is a joke... and I will make sure everybody knows it!",-1,-1
"I really wanted to treat myself and so decided to go in to Mood Swings. They have an introductory cut and style offer for $40. My stylist was Jade. She was extremely difficult to communicate with. She kept looking at everyone else at the salon rather than concentrating on me, or what I need. She never answered any of my questions correctly and was down right rude. I felt like totally walking away from the salon with my hair half cut. She did not even understand how I wanted my hair to be styled and just gave me the ordinary curling iron curls. Was extremely disappointed! Would never go back!",-1,-1
"I left Mood Swings very disappointed with my cut/style.  I took advantage of the first-time $40 deal and got a stylist with less than a year's experience.  She was about 20 years younger than I (I'm 42) and gave me a cut/style that someone 20 years younger would have probably appreciated.  I told her specifically what I wanted, but she didn't listen to (or hear) what I wanted.  I was very disappointed with the style I ended up with.  Maybe if I had done more research and specified a stylist with some experience, I would have been happier.  Or maybe this salon isn't for women of my age.",-1,-1
"I had the worst experience at this salon in my life. All I asked and called in advance for was a partial color. I got an email confirmation that it would happen. When I  went to my appointment, this was not at all what I got. My hair was washed, I was massaged, my entire head was colored (not the partial color I asked for) then she started styling, blow-dry ing and had me stand and styled and cut some more!!!!!! She even applied product to my hair!!! I was never asked or told I would get all these services. When it was all over, I went to pay, the bill was 215.00 dollars for a PARTIAL COLOR????? I don't think so!!!!!! I only expected 50 to 60 dollar bill. I didn't ask nor was I told by the stylist, she just kept going. I was in shock!!!!!! They wouldn't budge. The manager, even after calling, said nothing would be taken off the bill, not one cent!!!!! I am still fighting this and it's been three months of hell!!!! Don't get ripped off at this salon, don't go there, please!!!!!!!",-1,-1
This place gets a lot of really great reviews and I have been looking for a stylist.  I was a walk in and got a girl that had 5 years experience.  I could tell she was having a bad day and her heart just wasnt in the cut.  She didnt seem to listen to anything that I wanted and when she was finished my hair didnt look any different.  It was actually way worse than just that but I had started this review months ago and completely forgot to finish so I cant really remember now but I did call in and make a complaint so they set me up with another master stylist who did listen and fixed my hair but it was seriously not worth the high prices that they charge.   In fact I get about the same cut form this nice little Asian lady in Mesa that charges $8 at Teasers.,-1,-1
"I went to Mood Swings about a year ago...it gave me a mood swing, all right. I had a bad, choppy, horrible haircut there. I would'nt go back under any circumstances....",-1,-1
I applaud the professional response to my rather emotional review.,-1,-1
Worst salon I have ever been to. They let me leave the salon with dye in my hair. I had to go to another salon to have it fixed. By the way this is the day before I went on vacation. I called back to have the dye removed and they told me they couldn't take me until 8 PM that evening. No refund was offered or anything like that! $100 for nothing!!!! Run don't walk from this salon!,-1,-1
"This experience was a few months ago but I've just recently made my Yelp account. Sadly, this is one experience that will never let me trust anyone at this location. I came in for a brow wax/ brow shaping and tint. This was probably my second visit. I prefer to go elsewhere but I work on Mill and had been having a very busy week with school and work and decided I needed my brows done just as a self esteem booster. I do not remember who was helping me, but the woman who waxed my eyebrows seemed to be listening to what I wanted but when she waxed my hair she waxed the eyebrow slightly above the middle and left extra hair at the top. The brow tint color was fine, but she did such an awful job at waxing and plucking the hair to shape my eyebrows. I didn't notice until I had gotten home because the lighting in my bathroom is much better. But I was appalled, it's taking forever for my eyebrows to grow back. I really should have gone right back to the store but I didn't know how to address the situation because I've never had such bad service. I'm also disappointed that the person who rang me up didn't mention how bad it looked. Anyways, I will never be back for any services here and I will definitely NEVER recommend them to anyone. If I could give zero stars I would.",-1,-1
My color seemed great at first but my hair was pretty damaged and a lot broke off in front.,-1,-1
"My daughter went to Mood Swings at the Scottsdale location. They quoted her $40 for the services she requested over the phone. When all was said and done, the charge was almost $100, and the makeup job they did was so awful we can to come back home, wash it off, and start over. I would never recommend this snooty place to anyone. Ever. And I had to lose $100 to find that out. NEVER AGAIN.",-1,-1
"This place was awful. They did not listen to a thing I said about how I would like my hair and makeup, I even showed them pictures. It was nothing difficult either. It was a simple half up do and a natural makeup. They made me look like Amy Winehouse! Let me add this was also for my wedding!!!! Let's just say I ended up in tears and spent ALOT of money that went to waste. I went home and my sister redid my hair and make up and saved the day. I will never be coming back here. Ever.",-1,-1
"Well, I was able to eat the poutine. Although ..to me, dark fries like that usually signal dirty cooking oil.  Here is my major complaint, there are a lot of fruit flies in the place. It kind of made me sick to my stomach.  This to me, signifies...dirty, unclean, not hygienic enough.    Some people give the excuse you can't control the fruit flies, but i have always found it is only places that arent regularly cleaned deeply...and I don't mean once a month.  Well just my opinion. Nice staff..when they don't shout out how much the last customer tipped them in front of you.......It's not the best place in Montreal.",-1,-1
"Very mediocre poutine. Wasn't even hot, the cheese never even had a chance to melt. The gravy was not that great. Have had a tastier poutine at the A&W on the saskatchewan border. Strange...",-1,-1
"we were excited to come here as we kept passing it on our strolls, the food was unremarkable, the beer was really good; however, their service was rushed and angry. in this industry (also in such a tiny shop) this makes all the difference.   the man at the cash register was annoyed and loudly tried to tell me ""how service works in North America"" all over a misunderstanding. I'm an Asian American born and raised in North America and that comment was a slap in the face. I don't know where he might have thought I was from but does that matter? thumbs down for ignorance and poutine that was mediocre at best. thumbs up for beer and beer only (since it probably made me docile enough to tolerate inexcusable behavior from the staff)",-1,-1
"I came 15 minutes before close but because the dirty hipster couldn't process orders from the group in front of me in time I wasnt able to order. At that point everything else around was closed. I have never experienced such pathetic service, but such is Montreal. I would never go back not recommend. Find a better alternative for cheap food.",-1,-1
"I really don't know what is the big deal about the poutine in this place. Honestly I had better - considering the price and the taste, I think McDonald poutine (when they had it back in Vancouver) is better value.  Now the burgers... I dont know about this mustard - it's not subtle at all - It's way too overpowering considering meat to bun ratio.  In this case, I think I would opt to eat five guys instead.    Good try though.  Luckily we got sandwiches from omnivore at the same time so... We were satisfied overall that night with our choice of food.",-1,-1
"This was my first poutine experience in Montreal.  Lots of people hate on poutine but I thought fries, gravy and cheese curds would be right up my alley. Unfortunately, given such an easy-win list of ingredients this just wasn't that good.  Maybe I don't like poutine (I don't know; again, given those ingredients I don't know how it could be anything but awesome) or maybe this place isn't that good as far as poutine goes.  Either way, something lacking here.",-1,-1
"1 star not for the food experience but the service my fiancÃ©e and I received from the bearded guy at the register, not only wasn't he welcoming ( the way he spoke to us had a vibe of ""don't stay here, we have other people coming"" but at the end he overcharged me by almost 10 dollars, I noticed the mistake once I got out, came back and confronted him. He acted as if it wasn't his fault but ultimately admitted to the mistake and I got my money back. Food was delicious but I won't come back because of that prick. The other two guys were super cool.",-1,-1
"My boyfriend and i wanted to try a new poutine place so we stepped in and ordered. The man asked us if we wanted to sit down or take out. Since it was 11:30pm we figured we'd probably take some home anyways. We asked to have in a to go box but we would sit there to eat; less dishes to do and more environmentally friendly.   ""Could we have it to go but eat here instead?"" ""Thats exactly what i dont want. Its only for here or take out.""  With that tone of voice, i'm boycotting that place and he will never take a dime from me.   Ive done customer service for 10 years and thats surely not how you make clients feel welcome.   I guess im better off giving my money to a poutine place that actually deserves it before acting all pretentious.",-1,-1
Honestly I always wanted to try this place and was disappointed....I ordered a poutine to go and honestly you don't get much for $5.16 after 4 bites its gone  sauce nothing special....oh yeah maybe its the olive they put on top that costs a fortune!!,-1,-1
"We had our wedding here last fall in the Juno garden. We chose the Caesars package which included extras such as a limo ride, flower credit, food credit, bridal hair and makeup up, etc...  I'd love to say we had a great experience but sadly we didn't. Our planner wasn't as dedicated as they made it sound like she'd be. And she lacked in communication with not only us, but other people responsible for aspects of our wedding.   My bouquet while beautiful was outrageously overpriced as well as all the other arrangements. The photographer was amateurish and lacked imagination for poses. The videographer was also amateurish in that they used only one camera so you got only one point of view, the quality of which could easily have been surpassed by any one of my guests.  The limo driver, which was supposed to have been cancelled by my planner due to an event that closed down the strip, was not notified his services had been cancelled and had a horrible attitude. Essentially all their contractors were unprofessional and excessively overpriced if you wanted something not included in your package. And if you do not want to use their contractors you have to pay a fee to use your own.   Our wedding planner stated she could not help us plan the reception, which was fine as they were two separate events, but when asked for guidance as to who to contact to plan the reception we were essentially told to go to one of their restaurants. We told her we wanted a banquet style reception and were made to believe that the restaurants were our only choice. Come to find out they do have banquet style reception planners, but that was another horrible experience for similar reasons as in this review.   The hotel staff while not directly attached to the wedding planning side of the hotel tried to make our stay special and did sweet things to make our stay romantic, but they entered our room multiple times without our permission which made me extremely uncomfortable. Housecleaning even entered our room and removed items after I and my guests had told them that we did not want housecleaning or for them to enter the room. Hotel staff even entered the room after we put the do not disturb sign on the door. They also disrupted us during our ""alone"" time ruining the moment.   I booked our entire wedding ceremony and hotel stay with our ""dedicated"" wedding planner, who like I said was not very dedicated or communicative. We ended up being charged what they are saying is a resort fee of $84 without that resort fee being disclosed on any paperwork and that fee was charged after we had checked out and paid our entire bill leaving with a zero balance. We were also charged $200 after checking out with a zero balance, that $200 supposedly being an incidental fee which we had no incidentals. Lastly, at one point we had a pending $275 charge that luckily did not go through, that was also unaccounted for. We told our planner what our budget was and she did not respect it one bit. If anything she was trying to get every last cent she could from us as evidenced by the charges we were charged after everything was said and done. And yes, It was determined that those extra charges were because of the wedding planner. And yes, after making multiple grievances with the hotel and claims with my bank, we were reimbursed the money.   Overall very bad experience that made a stressful day even worse and ruined our memories of our special day.",-1,-1
"Of all the hotels my wife and I could've chosen to have our wedding at we chose the Caesar's palace. It has always has been my favorite complex until the way we were treated by their rude vallet staff.   Nathan, their head of parking was the first one to greet us with a rude, bad attitude. Even though I explained to him we were getting married there he said that only ""diamond"" guest could get their vehicles vallet by the front entrance with a pretentious demeanour. So there we went towards the back of the building with all our things to move across the entire hotel.   The second rude vallet employee Miguel, who worked the area where we were told by him that it was parking only for Limos, was very condescending by telling us that that area was for Limos only, asking, ""do you see any taxis here""? Even though there was a cab right in front of us and the reason why we walked to that door to beging with. Idiot!!   Third, they would not allow our Limo driver from Elite Limos (Awesome by the way!) to park in from of the entrance while we were walking towards it with my family, my wife's family and all if our friends, 45 total. They made him move, when he tried to drive around they yelled at the poor guy and made him park way far from us, forcing us to take a long walk outside in the super hot heat, at 8 pm in the evening!! We were sweating our Arses off!! Exhausting!! We spent a lot of money to get married there and we were treated like we were peasants!! As if they were doing it for free!! Nothing but bad attitudes from people who make most of their living with tips! What the hell happened to good customer service?? The wedding itself thank God went well. But the hotel not only ignored my complaints in regards to their rude staff, but never called us back with any resolution what so ever which shows how little they really care.   Our advice, if you are getting married, go to Bellagio, Aria or any other place were they will treat you the way you are supposed to be treated, ""diamond"" members or not, it was our wedding day and my family had to travel from another country to come share this with us, including Family and friends from Michigan and other states.   We stayed there four days and brought a lot business, including our relatives and friends who stayed there and spent a lot of money as well.  What bothers us the most, is that until this  day no one has cared to even try to make any of this right in spite of all the calls I have made and the several ""managers"" I spoken with.   The Caesar's Palace staff partially ruined our wedding. Never again, we will stay at your hotel.",-1,-1
"Update - please be very wary of the Keratin treatment.  Within a week of having it done, my hair started falling in clumps.  If you have baby fine hair like I do, I'm not sure this treatment is the safest for the hair type.  I called the salon twice to talk to a manager about my experience, and could not get someone to return my calls.  Disappointing.  Anyhow, after a few months, I finally had to chop off about 5 inches of my hair, because the breakage was so bad.   I don't fault the stylist, per se, but I think this procedure can be too harsh for fine hair, and I was not happy that two calls to the salon manager were unreturned, even afer I left my name, number, and reason for the call.",-1,-1
"It started out great....super cut and color, nice stylist, comfortable shop....pricey but nothing crazy...then back for another visit - good color, ok cut....then another visit - ok color, bad cut...ugh. Why do stylists lose their groove? that is seriously irritating. I couldnt take it, no going back for me. I could have gone back and had her fix it, etc but at that pt - I was just DONE - as in, get me to a new stylist. There may be some other stylists at the shop that are better, but I am not risking it!",-1,-1
"I purchased a Groupon to Salon Tru and for the first time ever, almost missed the chance to use it before it expired. I called early this morning to get a manicure, but they were booked solid. I've been wanting to get a streak of bright color in my hair ever since I colored over it last year so I asked if that was possible and what the cost would be. I remember being told was that it would be $90, so I asked the cost without the blow dry, and I was told $45. Perfect, the Groupon was for $50. The woman on the phone was SO nice and cheery and so I expected equal service in the salon.  I got in about 4 minutes late, and was kind of ignored until I moved to stand directly in front of the receptionist's line of vision. Both she and another woman who came out a few minutes later were not very welcoming. It was 2:10 or so by now and Colleen came to pick me up and we went to her chair. I described what I wanted. She seemed to be having one of those days.. or maybe that's just her personality. She went back to check on hair dye colors and returned after what felt like 5 minutes. I decided on purple, so she went to the back again to mix the bleach. 5 minutes later, just as she was about to apply the bleach to literally a 1"" section of hair, I asked how much it would be, because I had a feeling something was weird. She told me ""umm, probably $75."" I told her that's not what I was quoted, and that's not what I was willing to pay. I'd blow dry my own hair if I had to, but $75 for a tiny piece of hair was ridiculous. She told me the person on the phone was wrong and her prices ""start at $45"" but was based on sitting time. (So apparently if you have darker hair, you get screwed and have to pay more than people with lighter hair because it takes longer?) She again disappeared to the back to ""ask someone"" what could be done, and came back saying she could put in fake purple extensions for the Groupon price. Fine, sure, not at all what I wanted, but okay. I asked what colors, decided on purple again, and when she came back, I didn't like the color of the extensions, they were a faded purple. She went back again to bring out the other colors, one of which was a richer purple (why wouldn't she just grab them all in the first place?) I ended up doing 4 pieces for $50.  I am really put out with the customer service experience and will not go back, unfortunately. If you want an experience ten times better, try going to Dolce.",-1,-1
"Restaurant was pretty good, but it SO wasn't worth what I went through to get it.  Went in with a friend on a Sunday and asked for a table which took about 40 mins. ""Okay, no biggie"" I thought. Understandable, it's lunch rush on the weekend so it's to be expected. We decided to kill time by just walking around and seeing the wall decorations and various machines on display when I was approached by one of the workers asking if I was 21 (I was not). She tells me I'm not allowed to be by the machines because of that reason and I don't protest. Rules are rules, that's fair.   So my friend and I go back to the counter where ypu ask for a table to wait out the rest of the time and she comes up to us again and basically tells us we shouldn't even be touching the ground and backs us AGAINST THE WALL in this cramped, barely 10 square foot, poor excuse of a waiting area.   Lady, WE WERE WAITING FOR OUR TABLE. I was standing there for the remainder of our wait and she harasses me probably twice more before we are finally seated.   The restaurant workers were great and I had a pleasant dining experience except for the near constant harassment of this woman. Why I have to have been alive for 21+ years just to stand on your dirty carpeting is so important, I may never know. What I do know is that they'll never get the business of me or my acquaintances again.   Seniors and adults, enjoy the casino as you've been doing. Young adults, just go across the street to the Rainbow. They're much friendlier and have a proper waiting area for you to sit at.",-1,-1
"This is the 2nd time this has happened in this establishment. The first time I let it slide thinking it was a fluke. We just tried to eat at the restaurant with a party of eight (5 adults 3 children) today about 9:45 pm. First the hostess asked how many, we told her 8, she said she would be back, she walked to the back then came back up front ensuring not to make eye contact with anyone. She checked someone out, then walked to the cage. Next another girl walked up asked how many, she said she would be back, she too went to the back and never to return,  but stood in the back of the restaurant to discuss the situation with ALL of her fellow employees. Finally a young gentleman came up and informed us they could not seat us together and we would have to sit half in a booth and the others in a table near by, mind you there were only 2 customers in the ENTIRE restaurant. The 3 standalone tables in the middle were all empty. Very disappointed in the customer service we received. We will not be returning again.",-1,-1
On 7/5/16 me and my wife came in the late afternoon to play some video poker at the bar Day bartender was atentive and provided good service up to this point. Me and my wife like to play we were in to the house around $600 by shift change the new bartender was a bit unatentive to say the least I was done playing there tight video poker gave my wife some more money to play my wife ordered me a shot and beer but the bar tender told us we have to pay for my drink because  I'm not playing. I tried to explain to her I played $600 in the last hour and a half and she told me to bad pay for your drink. I payed in disbelieve and refused to tip. We also went to the cafe to get some ribs and chicken to go we were told no take out on ribs as quanity is low once again we explained there's no where on the board that says no take out and we wanted to get our food and go after the shalackin we took on there tight slots to no avail. We left and got Jack an the Crack. The moral of the story is go play somewhere else they look at you as a payday not a player and please give a hungry man some ribs you already got my shirt.,-1,-1
Had bad experienced.  We normally goes to Images right by Rainbow Casino.  Went to the Emerald Grill and ordered well done burger and got mine so pink and so bloody juice lol. And the server never told me that if i ordered onion ring beside fries it will cost us more which we don't really mind.  Cuz he mentioned onion rings so i ordered that instead of fries.  Of course while i am waiting for my new burger because i want it well done i have to wait again and didn't  even offer me anything . So when my well done burger arrive i am so full already cuz i had some of those very hard and so toughâ ribs. But its our first experience and so sad will go back to our favorite diner which is Images.  Server there is more friendly,-1,-1
This is not a good casino to win nor eat at. The food is overpriced primarily they do not get enough business. They added a William Hill Sports Betting Kiosk and that not increasing traffic at all. My main reason was for discontent was I have been coming here weekly since March on their free meal coupons it stated 11pm to 3pm. I had to cross the street and I arrived there at 3:04 pm and I have not eaten all day. Casino Manager Sharon and the owner both told me no so I was furious and gave them their card and told them to leave me alone. I truly despise a business that not only knows you but do not stand up for their customers and still expect them to be a customer. I not only can get better food prices elsewhere but have a way better gaming experience.,-1,-1
"It used to be fun coming to the Emerald Isle in spite of the smoky atmosphere because you could play all night and, even if you didn't come out ahead, at least you got to play for a while.  Now, you're lucky is a $20 bill lasts 5 minutes in any of the video slots.  The machines have become so tight even the free food and snacks isn't worth a visit.  You might as well stay home and put your money through a shredder, at least you won't wind up smelling like an ashtray.   Wake up Tim, your greed is killing off you're loyal regulars.",-1,-1
Place is just bad. Went here because the wait at the Rainbow was over a half an hour. Got right in here. There is a reason for that.... Service wasn't bad but the food was horrible. I will never go back. I will just have to wait it out at the Rainbow next time.,-1,-1
Wow ordered 2 pizzas thinking with good reviews this would be a good spot! Oh how I was wrong! Worst pizza I've ever had I would have been better off going to little Caesars !  Very disappointed!!,-1,-1
"This was listed as 4.5 stars but definitely fell short. We had a combination pizza and all of the veggies seemed either canned or just not fresh. I've had frozen pizzas that have better flavor. The garlic bread was nothing special either and the chocolate cannoli was bland and we didn't eat it. The one positive was that the delivery guy was very polite. If you want good pizza, this is not the restaurant for you.",-1,-1
"so to say this place is horrible is the least I could do... This place is a mess! They have cockroaches big and small crawling all over the silverware so please beware what you eat with because that is so unsanitary. A couple of friends I work with got some coupons from them to get $5.00 complimentary meal. Second, they kept a girl I worked with's credit card on file... And charged her fifty dollars the day after she bought her food from there. Who does that? And on top of that they mess up your order and there are really rude. I would not recommend this place. How do you know you're not eating cockroach legs or shells in your pizza? Gross right?",-1,-1
"Very mediocre food and bad service. We got there around 8:45PM and it looked like it was about to close. When we went to order (we were dining in), the guy taking our order seemed to act as if I weren't standing right there waiting to order. After he realized I wasn't going away, he reluctantly took my order. I got the all meat pizza with garlic knots and wings. Pizza was ok, mostly because the cheese and salami were good. The meatball was just awful and almost ruined the pizza. Only lots of ranch and crushed pepper saved this one from complete failure. Wings were good but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home with a bag of frozen Tyson wings and a bottle of Frank's hot sauce. Last but DEFINITELY least, the knots were totally burnt on the bottom! The guys working in the back didn't even wait for us to finish leaving the building before turning off the lights. With that said, I highly recommend you do not eat at this place unless you already got the Groupon like I did... In which case, just get it to carry out because the service is unacceptable.",-1,-1
"Stunned at the high reviews. Called in for small 2 topping & told 15 minutes. Got there in 10 minutes & told it's going out in the oven now. I sat & waited, watching my pizza sit, while a couple phone orders came in. It finally gets put in the oven & I try pay for it so I could go when it was done. Nope, not gonna happen....keep making pizzas & when I tell you I want to pay now, tell me to hang on a minute. Then I finally pay & you take my burnt pizza out of the oven. Professional pizza making man, you knew my pizza was burnt & put it in a box & handed it to me. I almost drove back to give it to you & tell you that's pretty sh***y to give me a burnt pizza. It might have been ok if it wasn't burnt, but I won't be going back to see. Anyone caring about the food they are serving, wouldn't have served that pizza. Waste of my time & money.",-1,-1
"Considering I can't rate it on taste,  because it never arrived,  I rate it a one on customer service. I called at 8:26pm,  the person who took my order seemed hesitant,  I guess because they close at 9. However,  he took my order and told me it would take 24 minutes. Well it never showed up. No one tried called me and I called the restaurant multiple times. I'll never have the opportunity to try them,  they ruined the. experience for me.",-1,-1
"Just had me a lunch spcl (2x slcs and a 12 0z can for $5 and change) and it was mediocre aaiight. It wouldn't hurt if the dude making the pies wear at least a pair of light plastic gloves if he's multi-tasking in touching the cash register and grabbing the counter pens, etc; They think they slick by chopping a full slice in 2 so the joint was about size of your palm of your hands that fit into a itty bitty pizza box. Probably it was their sauce but I found it a bit salty and it was HELLA greasy, had to go hit up Planet Fitness after. Comes down to getting simply what I paid for, but for over all courteous srvc, the 2 dudes there were super white people polite nice and not evil. Can't complain ;)",-1,-1
"One star because it's food and it was delivered otherwise it would be no stars. Delivery guy was delightful and the food is way below average. Pizza crust was soggy and topped with not very fresh tasting ingredients, sauce was flat, garlic cheesy bread looked like my 10 year old made it and tasted like it too...and chocolate dipped cannoli had no taste in the chocolate or the filling- so much so me and my guest took one bite, and threw it out...and we really wanted to like it!!  I don't know what else to say other than I have NO clue how this place gets 4.5 stars... If you have taste buds... Pick another place..",-1,-1
This is the WORST pizza ever!!! It gave my grandmother food poisoning and she had to be taken to the hospital.  These people NEVER getting business from us again and I'm going to tell people NOT to eat. They wouldn't even give us a refund.,-1,-1
My neighbor orders from them so I decided to try it for myself.  I was so disappointed after I spent $55.00 on an order. My mild  chicken wings though they looked amazing had no sauce at all and we're raw inside.  I ordered chicken fingers with BBQ sauce on the side they were drowning in sauce.  The Caesar salad was great but I ordered a Cobb salad and opened it to find only lettuce tomato cucumber strips and cheese???   So when I went online to get the number to call it said they were closed.  Hence why my order was prepared incorrectly they were trying to go home.  So since I work 12 hour shifts I was unable to call the following day but the next day I called as soon as they opened and asked for the manager who basically called me a liar.    He said if something was wrong I would have called back asap.  I told him this was asap for me.  I work 12HR days and they were closed when I realized the problem.  He said someone would have been there after closing the cleaning crew was there...lol  So I told him I don't want anything from you but to let you know what my first and now last experience was like.  He said we'll you should have called before now.  I also added I put the problem on the survey I received from eat street the (site that takes the orders) an hour after delivery you can check for yourself.  He said he would check into it and get back to me.  It's been a week you think he called back??   Thanks for great service!! Il be sure to spend my hard earned dollars where it's appreciated in the future!,-1,-1
"It was our business's first time ordering with this company for lunch. We ended up ordering 3 pizzas : the white pizza, the works, and the spicy BBQ. The pizza was NOT GOOD at all. The chicken was extremely SALTY. The vegetables all tasted not fresh. The whole pizzas must have been sitting for awhile because they tasted old. For a first time customer this was not a good thing. So we called and talked to the owner Joey to let him know. All he said was ""sorry but a company ordered the same thing u did and they loved it and our pizza is good so I don't know what you are saying."" Our total came to $46 and I requested to be refunded $23 because of our experience. He said ""I'm not gonna do that because our pizza is good."" First off this is NOT how the owner of the company should handle a customer at all. You do not state over that it's good pizza and that another company loved it. Maybe they got the good pizza he was talking about but we didn't. Also as the OWNER NOT knowing how to handle a situation like this is unacceptable. He should've said sorry how can I fix it for you so that our company can be one that u recommend again. Instead he chose to argue and be rude! I would NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GROSS PIZZA PLACE TO ANYONE EVER! The sad part is I never thought you could mess up pizza but Joey and the Pizza Company proved that they for sure can!",-1,-1
"Read all the reviews on yelp, figured this place would be great. Nope not all. Maybe if your Vegan but I don't have my pizza that way.   The shop could have been a lot cleaner. Had Junk laying around the back.   The staff was friendly but felt rushed when making my order.   Got a supreme pizza and salad. The pizza was alright tasting but nothing great at all. Had a pool of water/grease underneath it. Made the dough taste gross. Salad was nothing better then the bag kind you can buy at the store. My husband was fine but I did have a upset stomach all night afterwards.   Not worth the 25 bucks for it.",-1,-1
The food was decent but the service was terribly slow.  I had to get up a number of times to just grab items and our server barely checked in on us.  Many other better breakfast places given the food and service.,-1,-1
"service is nice, food is quick. food is super bland. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone  nor coming back.",-1,-1
"Great food. BUT...if you ask for tomatoes on the side INSTEAD of home fries and toast, they still want to charge you 2 dollars. There's a principal here and I will never visit this establishment again.",-1,-1
"I came here after work for a late breakfast. I ordered the Apple Cinnamon french toast. I've always considered french toast a fullproof meal but I was clearly wrong. My french toast was thick which I love but it seemed like it was very lightly dipped in the eggs bacause the middle tasted like regular toast not like bread that soaked up the eggs, milk and cinnamon. Also, I was very disappointed in the apple cinnamon topping. They didn't peel the apple before cooking them down. Anyone who bakes or cooks would sum that up to laziness. When you cook apples they become melt in your mouth soft but the skin remains chewy. You would never want the eat an apple pie with those contrasting textures. Overall my meal was meh but the servers were friendly and the restaurant was bright, open and clean. I'm sure other items on the menu are much better. I also liked the fact that they offer turkey bacon and coconut water in the coconut. I can't say for sure if I would go back to try it.",-1,-1
Very disappointed!!!  Is this a franchise? Food is salty and the eggs they use are very small.  I find it expensive as well. Close to $20 with my 15% tip for 2 tiny eggs potatoes and corn beef and of course coffee.  I will not recommend this place....other places are more reasonable. Waitress is very nice and quick in her service (only thing I like).,-1,-1
"Not sure what the craze is about this place. Would rather go to any other breakfast place. Too much time was placed on the seemingly witty pop culture nicknames on the menu and not enough time teaching service and crafting a good menu. Guacamole advertised but came as a paste, laughable that places still serve this!   What was unfortunate is our server was training another server and not once was my water refilled or coffee. Only came to drop off the food and to bill. Place was almost empty except for two other tables. What a terrible place. Asked server for suggestions didn't really tell us anything to try. 'Everything's good'.   Also the washroom smelled like death. Not a good thing to write about this place. Food was less than mediocre, poutine had potential but fell flat.",-1,-1
"it was okay - the food was mediocre and the service was subpar - we literally had to ask for everything. from water to ketchup to refills.. it was actually quite annoying.  I guess because it was kind of busy and they seemed short staffed; I felt we were getting rushed to pay our bill and leave. not my idea of a good brunch.   I had the eggs Bennie with bacon, my friend had the Oreo pancakes, my bf had the Montreal meat Bennie and my other friend had the French toast.  I found it ridiculous that substituting the home fries for veggies was an extra $1+ and that included sliced tomatoes... who pays that much for tomatoes?????",-1,-1
I really dislike the staff. They are not very accommodating and quite snobby.  We walked in at 3:20 and they wouldn't seat us. They close at 4. There's was at least 5 tables occupied and they had lots of space but they made us do takeout (which they start at 3:30). But either way this was ridiculous because 40 mins is plenty of time to sit and eat and be done before 4 for two people.,-1,-1
"So this is a sort of unusual Yelp review, given that we didn't actually end up eating at Nadia's. Here's why:  1. The food was pricey. And I am a person who can be willing to spend on occasion, but for Madison, this place was a little too expensive for its location and food. 2. The main reason we didn't eat there. There was nobody in the restaurant. I mean NOBODY. No host, no customers, nobody. And yes, it was open for business (according to the unlocked doors and times posted). 3. The kitchen looked disgusting and the fish tank (as noted earlier) could definitely use a good bath. Ironic, yeah.  We strayed off to find some other food and settled for the close-by Porta Bella.",-1,-1
"Ahh...Nadias...where to start...  I'd love to write that I can overlook the grimy dining room and horrendous service because the food is so good.  The truth is that the food is decent if pricey but not nearly good enough to make up for Nadia's many other shortcomings.  I know this is a strong statement but it was the worst service I've EVER had in a restaurant at this price range.  Yes, I mean that.      A quick list of 'to dos' for Nadias:  1.  Hire a service for that fish tank.  Nothing is more gross than an algae -filled fish tank in a restaurant.    2.  Replace the missing ceiling tiles and clean the chandeliers.  3.  Install a new rug.  4.  What is the deal with the circa 1994 TVs in the dining room?  I felt like someone was flipping channels all evening.   5. Sashimi Tuna @ $32 should not be served well.  And it was small.    6.  You should not run out of your Prix Fix Chocolate souffle at 7:30 PM on a Wednesday night.  Oh yea, and it shouldn't have the consistency of Jello pudding.   7.  The alcohol prices are a bit high.  $7 for a local brew is not ok.   8.  Figure out your french onion soup - it should be a staple.  Its WAY too sweet.    I'll stop here.  Nadias rests on their laurels and their State St location.  I can not recommend.  2 stars only because I think there is potential in some of their dishes.",-1,-1
"This has always been our favorite restaurant for celebrations but we're going to have to rethink that.  This is now the 3rd time we have had either bad service or less-than-excellent food.  Nadias is not a cheap restaurant -- the two of us each had one cocktail, an appetizer and main course:  $110 before tip.  For that price I expect that my food will be top-notch and the service impeccable.  First our foie gras went to another table and sat there for quite a while before the waiter realized it had gone to the wrong table.  By the time it got to our table it was stone-cold.  We ended up sending it back to get heated back up.  Then, no soup spoon -- we had to ask for one.  Then my salad had the wrong dressing on it -- had to send that back.  On top of this we witnessed multiple f***-ups so bad that I over heard the owner/chef griping at the wait staff -- and later, the sous chef had to go to the wait staff area/garde manger kitchen to get them to pick up their dishes that had been sitting on the line.  Nadias used to have an edge but it seems to have dulled with time!",-1,-1
"My wife and I went there for a Valentine's day dinner....so my experience may not be typical of an average day. Anyways, here's my bit...  We had a reservation for 7.30. We were not seated until 9pm....by which time, I had lost my temper, appetite, and the mood for some over-priced, sub-par rack of lamb! The food was barely ok....the tables were too close to each other and we were seated pretty close to the kitchen with a darn pillar blocking most of my view. Guess the window tables might be fun...but I don't think I'll ever go back to find out.",-1,-1
"This place used to be my favorite on the strip! We used to go for cheap drinks and foot-long $1.99 hotdogs. And now its been replaced by Nathans unimpressive dogs :/ They swapped out a lot of slots for Arcade games, which is decent, but I'm just generally disappointed in the changes.",-1,-1
"My wife and I visited this casino upon the advice of our parents who used to frequent this spot in the past. I'm not sure much has changed here since that time (70-80's). Lots of slot machines (as the name implies) and no tables (at least none attended) that I noticed. I have heard that there is better payout on these machines opposed to the larger names on the strip, but I did not experience that :-).   My wife and I visited this joint in the afternoon. We went to cash out our tickets and there was a sign at the cashier station that said ""closed - go to Circus Circus"". Nice! I think that might be a ploy to just have you stay put and spend the meager winning (if any) there.",-1,-1
They took out the table games and like half the machines to make room for pool tables and beer pong. And guess what? No on was playing. It used to be a fun place to play compared to the stuffy mega casios now its boring.,-1,-1
"Slots-A-Fun has very strange odor. A mixture of cigarettes, hot dogs, pizza, B.O., and industial strength cleaner (the kind they use in the ""adult"" bookstores). I took a couple friends through here on the obligatory ten minute tour. Enough time to buy a couple beers, lose $3 in a slot machine (at least I got a quarter back!!! A real quarter-not a coupon-the only reason this place gets 2 stars!) and cruise by the $1 roulette table. I was hoping to teach my table game-wary friend how to play a simple game of roulette, but the proliferation of Lil' John and Ludacris wannabes hovering nearby scared her away. YEEEEAAAAH! Oh well- I never do well at those low limit tables anyway. I played craps here once and dealers were extemely rude. I wonder why this place, and circus circus,still exist when everything else nearby has been imploded.",-1,-1
"My family and I came over to this casino for one reason: a foot long (1/2 pound) hot dog for 99 cents. We had seen a show on the Food Network about hot dogs and this place was one of the cheap ones. So, we tried it and didn't think much of it; it tasted like a big roll of bologna. I guess if you are a huge bologna fan, you'll really enjoy it. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything to go gaga for.",-1,-1
"The giant hotdogs are gone.  I repeat, the giant hotdogs are gone!!!!  Why has my God forsaken me?!  Oh, but they have specialized tables that let you play beer pong, so they got that going for them....",-1,-1
"I honestly feel the Circus Circus execs aka MGM Mirage, purposely sabotaged this place for reasons unknown. This place was semi well known for its always packed sidewalk craps table-gone, cheap blackjack and other table games-gone, funbooks which for years were passed out at the Circus Circus exit that included cheap drinks etc-gone, the giant Slots a Fun hot dogs featured on tv shows-replaced with chain restaurant dog, they used to give out free little sandwiches and donuts to gamblers in morning/afternoon-long gone, actual coin taking slot machines including the rare dime version video poker-gone. What you had was a casino that filled a cool little niche,  cheap drinks, old school machines that frankly can be fun to play as a novelty or just because, great table game atmosphere honestly possibly the funnest in Vegas and just a great little place to spend a few hours- LONG GONE. Replaced by generic slots that can be found in any casino anywhere, crappy chain food and no vibe or reason to be there.  Memo to whoever runs the Circus Circus unless you're intentionally running your budget casinos into the ground in order to justify closing them and building another monstrosity like City Center you are failing miserabley at what isn't a complicated job. Please understand part of Vegas is fun little ""dumpy"" places and you took one of the last if not the last one away for no reason I can decifer. No way this spot makes more now with its generic setup than its old form.",-1,-1
When you walk into a place and even the air feels dirty something is amiss.  It's all electronic games. No tables with real people dealing.  We went out of our way to check it out and were vary disappointed.  Not worth the walk from anywhere.,-1,-1
"Slots A Fun brings back a lot of great memories for me.  Unfortunately, this place has been ignored and is no longer the fun place it once was.  Perhaps someone will step in and save the place, but I fear it's days are numbered.  We visited last weekend and there were 10 or 15 people wandering around.  I felt sorry for the poor DJ they hired for some reason to play to an empty casino.  DJ, Bowling, Beer Pong, Pool Tables, it all seems so random. I have an idea, bring back live Blackjack dealers, a roulette wheel, maybe a craps table and put it right out front where it used to be.  Bring back slot machines to fill in the emptiness of the place. Am I asking too much?",-1,-1
"Yes, they do have $1 craps. The problem is, if you've ever played craps, you can't make proper odds on a one dollar bet, so they are really just taking advantage. The crowd here is a sad and drained one, and I would recommend staying clear. Yes, the drinks and gambling are cheap, but you can find a good deal further up the strip with a much better vibe. Stay away from slots of fun.",-1,-1
"Slots A Fun use to hold a dear spot in my heart up until the Rivera was torn down 2016. I met my girlfriend there on a blind date through a close friend of mine. We would hangout there occasionally for a hour or two on a Friday, Saturday. Beers were two for 5 imports $7 including tips to take care of our bartender. We would play beer pong, pool, a few slot machines, video poker. Listen to some classic rock while having a ball. I was in Slots A Fun earlier this year and the same beer imports we use to get are now $14. For what? The only reason why we went there was for the beer specials. It's not looking to good only a few people last time I was inside. After we bought our LAST round we just turned around and walked out. Don't plan on going back. That side of the strip is just to depressing. I wish Circus Circus all of the luck to keep open. Goodbye old buddy Vegas greed got you now.",-1,-1
This is the smokiest casino I've ever seen. It's poorly ventilated.  The air didn't seem to be working either. I visited around 7 pm and it was still unbearable. I played on machine while there and there was a sign on the machine saying you get no players points for playing on that craps machine.,-1,-1
"In the old days, I came here after my money ran low to kill time before the night clubs opened.  It was truly a sight to be seen.  There were plenty of tables, numerous bottled beers, and slots abound.  It was a good place to cut your teeth the tables without spending too much money.  The dealers would chat you up and teach you about the game.  The dollar hot dogs were big enough to share with a friend or two.  The customer service was excellent while the drinks were stiff.  ALL OF THAT IS GONE!!   This casino advertises dollar black jack, craps, and roulette.  However, in actuality there are no live tables at all.  It is all video.  The place is run down and smells like crap.  The dollar hot dogs have been replaced.  There is an over priced Subway inside.  There really is no customer service to be had because it seems like no one works there anymore.  There is security and maybe one server.  The place was full of people that I would cross the street to avoid.",-1,-1
"What a dive !  We stumbled upon this place walking out of Circus Circus around 6 am the morning after eloping at the Bellagio fountains.   We had partied all night and it was getting bright out and time to head back towards our hotel.   This place was a worn out, tacky, run down, almost depressing if you were there to seriously try to gamble.   I didn't realize it was separate from Circus Circus.  Now there were slot machines ( very old ones ) but it hardly could be called ""Slots o fun"" more like ""Slots o gloom"" or ""Slots here won't be won""   No one looked happy. The food selection was grim.  We were wasted and happy ( see pics ) so we had a some fun for the short time we were there.  On our last trip, I wound up there again by mistake. I went out of Circus Circus ( ya I know - but we stay in 5 star resorts so we like to slum it on occasion ) for some fresh air, and here it was - SOF.   I just had to check to see if it was as bad as I remembered- and it was actually worse!   It was dead empty. I am the only one there. The carpets stuck to my flip flops and it reeked of stale smoke ( yuck )   I sat at a machine to kill a few minuets, and some sketchy guy comes in and slides up rite beside me asks if the seats taken....  I say go ahead - mistake! He must of been some low level pimp. He tries to pick me up and thankfully my husband shows up right at that time and we leave.   Bye bye SOF I won't be back !",-1,-1
"What happened to the famous 1.00 Hot Dog! Now they have 2 for 5 bucks, what a dissapointment. Once again something great is changed for the Almighty dollar. Greed",-1,-1
"Meh...... Yea just meh  it's on the strip in an area which is kinda dwindling away of all the glitz and glitter which Vegas has to offer, worth a quick walk thru if your @ circus circus and heading back down to the more lively parts of the strip. Has a couple tables which are never accompanied by an employee, some slots, and a few vending type gambling games, $1 blackjack machines, video table games... not really exciting or worth spending a lengthy amount of time with all the other great places on the strip. I wouldn't go outta my way to visit.  Saw a little snack bar with cheap eats, sodas, beers....",-1,-1
"We only ventured here because we had a coupon for a free hot dog and beer.  Disgusting doesn't even begin to describe the ""hot dog"".  Utterly inedible.  There are plenty of other bargain and cheap eats out there.  Skip this one.",-1,-1
Today as I walked in we were greatly disappointed that there is no more blackjack tables. It's the end of an era.,-1,-1
"This place is no longer was it once was. No more fun thrills and cheap food. I remember going in there it was ALWAYS crowded, even people overflowed onto the sidewalk. Their famous $2 Heinekens and $1 half pound hot dogs and shrimp coctails.. and the best of all were real dealers at the blackjack and roulette tables. It's all been replaced. Video blackjack and video roulette. Where's the fun in that? No more cheap beer or food either, just a subway and Nathan's. And worst of all it's deserted now.. it was one of the last old school feel places and now that feeling is gone!",-1,-1
Slots Of Fun managed by Circus Circus just needs to rollover and die. This is not the Slots Of Fun of yesteryear. They took out all the live table games and dealers. There was not many slots like there used to be and they added pool tables. Who the hell goes to Vegas to play pool? I did not see a bartender nor a waitress but that's probably because I was in and out literally in under 60 seconds. I might check it out next time only because it seemed quiet and I hear they have $1 video blackjack based on prior reviews.,-1,-1
"I ventured over here to kill some time, but the slots were really boring and I didn't win anything. Generally I'll win a few bucks, but here, the slots were really old.... you can tell they taped some of the missing bits together with Scotch tape. So lame. The machines also don't spin properly. However, you'll find the cheapie slots from 1 cent up which could be cool for some.",-1,-1
"Slots of fun has the reputation for being a fun place....it was not fun at all.  $.99 hots dogs did not sit well in my stomach, the pina colada almost ended my life, and to top it off i lost money in the slots machine.  Thanks for the fun...slots of fun",-1,-1
"Slots a fun is a gambling hall dating back to what smaller LV gaming was like before in the 70s and 80s. Giving you a different feel, people came for the $1 hot dogs and you have a definitely younger feel at the casino here than the major ones on the strip. I remember coming here 15 years ago when I couldn't afford the $15 -$25 minimums of the main casinos for table games and you could enjoy blackjack or the other games for $2 a hand or $5 a hand. It would get rowdy here with the younger crowd and drink specials as the night went on! Now it's looking a little more tired as it ages and you wonder how much longer they can keep a go at it before the wrecking ball or dynamite blows the place up. The N end of the strip will be revitalized I. The next 10-20 years as the boom comes back and then the property here will be worth a lot. Till the it's an aging casino that has seen many a wild night and we shall see how long it lasts!",-1,-1
"I'll start by saying, I'm really surprised this place still exists. If I could I would give it zero stars. From someone who's seen this place thriving at its best in the '80s it hard to imagine this place is  still operating in its current condition.   This casino HAD it all, it had the excitement, cheap table games, free souvenirs, music, crowds, lots of slots, value and more value, etc...now the place is a neglected rundown ghost town with no table gaming, very few out-dated slots and a very quiet depressing atmosphere. My guess this place is still operating is, they don't want to give the adjacent Casino (Circus Circus) a bigger ""eye sore"" by closing it down prematurely before they continue to redeveloped that hurting north end of the strip.   Sorry for the harsh review but, I'm sure I didn't point out anything that the operator/owners (MGM) don't already know. I doubt they even bother reading their reviews.",-1,-1
"I dragged my party down to Slots-A-Fun because it was the last place that I knew on the strip that had coin operated machines.  I miss that *ching*ching*ching* sound and a bucket full of nickels, unfortunately, it's gone from here too.",-1,-1
"This place has great pizza!  Everything here is real good EXCEPT the customer service. The customer service was great before now it seems you're doing them a favor by ordering from them. They have become very rude, very impatient with customers. I only order delivery. I can""t imagine if I walked into this place and ate there.  Remember MARCO""s we the customers make your business thrive. Find better employees or we will not eat here any longer.",-1,-1
"Horrible wings, no meat. Horrible pizza, overcooked and hardly any sauce. Wings are advertised as being super meaty. Not true.",-1,-1
"Customer Services is HORRIBLE! Placed an internet order.I arrived at the time promised in the email. The lady at the counter told me it was just coming out of the oven. In fact, it had not even been started yet. Meanwhile, walk in customers who arrived after me,  were ordering at the counter and  getting their orders before me. Try being HONEST and upfront with your customers, chances are , they will usually understand.",-1,-1
"Do you like receiving illegal robocalls on your cell phone that is registered on the Do-Not-Call registry?  Me neither.  But I was getting weekly robocalls about ""saving money on my electric bill"" and no matter how many times I tell them I'm not interested, take me off your list, I don't qualify, etc, I still keep getting the calls.  So I decide to set up an appointment to see who the hell is bombarding me with these robocalls and who shows up?  These guys do!  If you are looking for solar, I would suggest going with a company that respects your not wanting to be bombarded with cold-calls and actually abides by the TCPA, not these guys.",-1,-1
"I am not so impressed with ifa as aygul. I have never been to another language school in Stuttgart, but ifa is not a particularly motivating place. Teachers are often grumpy.    Technology is very low about 1980s..no language lab, not much in supporting audio material or that type of thing, i have never even seen a pc there. Teachers like to play childish games in class that kill time as well.    The school seems proud of the historic location, but actually it is a construction pit of renovation. It is rather noisy and unpleasant, but it is a short walk from u bahn, so that is a good.    I would give ifa a C grade. Nothing special. an intensive course is about 20 hours a week, any school should be able to teach something in that amount of time.",-1,-1
"I want to start by saying I am open to adjusting the review if IFA attempts to fix the situation. I would like to describe my experience here so anyone considering studying here can be aware. I signed up for a B2 Deutschkurs because my other school (AGI) was full. During the sign up process they told me that I would have to take a placement test. So I asked the secretary if I would get my money back if I didn't pass the test (or if I wasn't issued my visa), and she said yes of course. So I sent them the 730â¬ in good faith and got my visa extended. A few weeks later I took the test, and leaving I felt very confident that I had done well. We would see the results on that Friday. So my friend who had also taken the test with them goes before me on Friday. He texts me that he had not enough points and they told him that they WOULD NOT be able to give him his money back and he would have to retake B1 with them! They told him that if he wanted to take B2 he could maybe attend the first 3 or 4 days of class and if he was able to keep up they would allow him to continue. These were his only options! So I was very concerned that they would tell me something similar. I was preparing to demand my money back because I had just finished taking B1 and did very well in the class at AGI. So I rushed over there and asked for my scores. They told me that I also had not scored enough and that I had to retake B1 with them. I asked if I could do the same as my friend and try to attend the first few days and see from there. They told me no! I said they offered it to my friend and they told me his score was probably better than mine but for me it was not possible. Later I found out we had the SAME EXACT SCORE. I said there was no way I am going to retake B1 because I just spent two months doing B1 and how am I supposed to afford this?! These courses are not cheap! After a while of talking to the secretary they agreed to give me some of my money back, but they will charge a 50â¬ fee! Remember, earlier I had asked specifically if I would be able to get my money back and they said that would be no problem! No one mentioned I would have to argue with them for my money or anything about a fee! I told my friend that I got my money back and so he was very pissed that they didn't do the same for him. He went back and got his, but he was also charged this 50â¬. We both signed up for classes at AGI and there was no arbitrarily graded test and none of this drama! They also let us go to the course even though we couldn't pay until IFA finally sent the money back! Very nice of AGI! Long story short, they gave us each completely different information on two counts - firstly that I could get my money back and he couldn't, and secondly that he could try out the first few days and I couldn't, despite having the same scores. I don't know what this is about! If we hadn't been friends and been able to compare our experiences, we would both have been screwed! I don't know why they are telling people different info, deceiving me by saying there would be no problems getting the money back. All I can say is they want to force some to retake a lower level with them so you end up studying with them longer and they make more money! Not cool! If anyone is looking for a great language school without any of this drama, I can highly recommend AGI (Anglo German Institute). They are great, friendly, and flexible! They really saved me by making a place for me in B2 after I got screwed over.",-1,-1
"Food isn't all that good. Way overpriced. Would not recommend.  Terrible for kids, or elderly people. Not good if you dislike fancy Italian food. If you want some more normal, casual food, you're right out of luck.  This would be a good place for a middle aged, decently wealthy (or at least not poor, if you're gonna waste your money somewhere, don't waste it here) couple going out for a fancy meal.",-1,-1
"This is the slowest service. After waiting 20mins or longer, the barristas still get orders wrong 90% of the time..We stopped going. We rather drive 3 more miles down rainbow to get a decent  statrbucks coffee.",-1,-1
Took literally almost 30 minutes to get my peppermint mocha using the drive thru... Longest one in my record!!!,-1,-1
"Waited in the drive thru for about 15 minutes just to have them tell me they were all out of my drink when I got to the window. Poor, slow service and in a terrible neighborhood. Not going back to that one again!",-1,-1
Order was wrong. Had someone pick me up an Evolution Fresh Sweet Green Smoothie and staff at Starbucks gave the Evolution Fresh Sweet Greens and Lemon Juice Bottle and said this is the one. I'm assuming the staff didn't know the difference between the two. Very upsetting.,-1,-1
"If I could give less Stars I would. This has got to be the slowest Starbucks I have ever been too, and I have been to a lot all over the country. Of course I am from the Seattle area so my expectations are high. But when there are only one or two cars ahead of you in the Drive-Thru line and it takes 10 minutes that's crazy and this is the 4th time I've been here and going inside is even worse. My order was correct but the wait times are crazy. Very disappointing",-1,-1
"this is probably the worst Starbucks drive thru I've been to, waited about 20 min. idk if it's me but isn't that kind of long for a drive thru? the most I've waited was like 10 min or so, maybe because it's the only 24 hour location off the strip? but they are completely slow, if you'd come to this location in the morning id suggest leaving 30 min. early lol pretty ridiculous",-1,-1
"ugh!!!! The only good thing about this Starbucks is, it's open 24 hour hours, and closer to home for me. Especially working grave and going to school in the evenings, it's a life saver for the needed caffeine. Especially when I go to the drive through, it seems like I get the same idiot who always get my orders wrong. I asked for a venti, he tries to gives me a grande. I asked for a cup of water in the same order, he charges me for a bottle water! He even tried to charge me for the wrong order, which is almost double!!! It's been like this since around September, and I don't know how he keeps his job, with him constantly making a mistake!!! IF I have to, I'll go inside. I will ask for someone else if he takes my order, because knowing him, he will screw up my order and over charge me. It's a good thing I pay attention with this idiot!",-1,-1
"This place is probably one of the busier Starbucks in town wing open 24/7.  Although I love the fun personality of the baristas at Starbucks..  Asking me if I wanted a hot or cold frapp and proceeding to get annoyed with my response is definitely not funny.  ""I'd like a grande pumpkin spice frappucino.""  ""do you want that hot or cold?""  ""I'd like the pumpkin spice frappucino please?""  ""I heard you the first time do you want it hot or cold?""  ""... Cold?""  ""ugh next window please, you have no sense of humor""  And no I don't have a bad sense of humor, you have a bad way of earning tips.  Insulting your customers, not apologizing, and having an attitude= bad for business.",-1,-1
"I am a regular at about 3 Starbucks' locations here in town and this is by far the worst one. Yes, they are very busy, but this does not excuse the mediocre service and dirty tables on a regular basis. This location seems to be the preferred spot for local cabbies and you can almost always count on a 8-10 person line, which is fine and does not factor into my 2 star rating for this Starbucks. What DOES affect my rating are at the following  1) Consistently dirty tables, floors, and restroom. You can almost always count on having empty cups, spilled milk/half and half, sugar, etc both on the tables and on the straw/napkin area. Seems like perhaps a lack of proper staffing and/or lack of awareness.  2) Compared to other Starbucks, staff seems extremely smug and unhappy except for 2 or 3 employees. Yes, we know it's busy and this location is probably more difficult than other locations, but you have a great job and are consistently busy.   3) Regardless of how complicated your drink is, you are PAYING good money for it. My drink is almost $7 and I have at least 5 per week. No other location has ever had an issue making it, yet here, ""Ben"" the barista, seemed to have a problem with how the drink was ordered and when he called it out at the bar, he used a very smug and sarcastic tone which is NOT appreciated. If you don't like your service job, don't be in service buddy.",-1,-1
"I used to go to this location as my usual hangout spot with my usual hangout group seeing the usual regulars and the usual employees... but that's all changed. I don't knew what or when they decided to stop giving a hoot here. They renovated the place and now it looks cheap. There is always something wrong with the bathrooms... ALWAYS. Half of the staff is  unhappy now and the outside sitting area is seriously gross. I don't know what's going on but I bet it has to do with the new Charles Frias park they built across the street. If there's a park nearby, it's a living area for many homeless people and I've seen a  increasing number of them in that area, even saw a few ""bum fights"" happen while I was there. They need to clean up the outside of their establishment, maintain the inside, and (actually this one is for the business that manages the building complex area) better patrol their customers. I have much more to include but I think I've made my point clear.",-1,-1
I'm sitting here in front of the drive thru and it's horrible experience! As we approached the window the starbucks attendant just closed the window without saying anything and let us wait for 10mins! And never apologize for the wait!!!!!,-1,-1
The longest I've waited in a drive thru for just ONE drink... Come on it's only coffee! Y'all gotta learn how to communicate we ordered twice one on the machine and the other at the window boohoo,-1,-1
"This is the worse Starbucks ever!! Drinks taste like crap and you wait in line for 20min every time. Customer service, you can forget about it.",-1,-1
"Writing this review as I'm leaving, after spending 15 mins waiting for a drink. First - they're doing construction on their drive thru and when we ask if it's closed off completely the girl simply says ""yes and no."" Okay?  The line wasn't stupidly long the way you'd think a Starbucks with no drive-thru would be but they were training people so we ended up waiting forever on one drink. A hot drink, and not to mention that three people after us got their drinks before us; two people ordered multiple drinks.   I, like a lot of people, have been to multiple Starbucks locations and this is the only one where I constantly see the same people either chatting it up with customers in the drive-thru and holding up the line (one time I witnessed a conversation that lasted about 10 minutes) and inside the store I constantly see a long line and baristas just standing there, letting one person do everything.",-1,-1
"This place used to have the speediest service. Now, I've been late for work twice because of the long wait at the drive-thru. Short line, long wait. Get your act together, please!!",-1,-1
"I've been in the line up so long I thought I would write a review!!!! Smell is very odd and even though there aren't a lot of people we have been here forever, just waiting.....",-1,-1
"Worst Starbucks in Las Vegas. If you go in prepare to wait an eternity as the feckless crew forgets to put your cup in like with the endless others from the drive thru which they prioritize over the walk-ins. After 15-20 minutes of wAiting we finally asked for refunds (including dollar tip I had given). The ""supervisor"" didn't offer to comp our drinks or anything and tried to play it off as drive thru back orders caused our delay but it was really the cashier girl who dropped the ball. They are slow and they don't care about customer satisfaction. The Starbucks nearby on Flamingo is much better and that's where we went and had our drink in less than five minutes.",-1,-1
"This is based upon my recent drive thru experience; I've been inside before. Not impressed with either.   Upon rolling up to the ordering board, whoever was working the drive thru was clearly not interested in taking orders let alone taking them correctly.   I was invited to spend a few minutes looking at the board as she would be back in a few minutes. Upon hee return, I repeated my order 3 times. ""Hot grande toffee nut latte with soy, whip & no foam."" The first time she just wasn't paying attention; it took 2 other tries to get it right.   When I arrived at the window, she repeated my order and AGAIN it was wrong. I told her not to give me a drink unless it was made with soy; i will know after the first drink if it's wrong & I will get seriously sick if they try to pass it off as right. She looked at me like I was from another planet, then questioned me about the whip. My dietary issues aren't her concern...just make my drink the way I ordered it. They got it right the 3rd time.   My office frequents this location multiple times a week for TO GO coffee runs. My order is always the same. They NEVER get it right. I am always sick after the first drink of my latte. Really tired of wasting my money here...$5 for a sip of latte that gets binned & I'm sick all day because they make drinks how they want to instead of how the customer orders them.   The service isn't great either.",-1,-1
"I have been a very loyal Starbucks fan and gold card holder for many years now, so when it comes to drinks, my palate can definitely tell the good from the bad. This location is definitely a miss--both in service and the quality of their drinks. There is something always wrong at this Starbucks. I come here often because it is only a couple blocks from my house and in the beginning, I thought okay maybe it was just a coincidence, but time after time, there is always something wrong. After todays ""oppsies"", I had to write this review. Here are a list of the mishaps that I remember off the top of my head:  1. Asking for less ice and getting more ice than normal. 2. Their mobile site offered Chestnut Praline Latte only for them to say that they no longer offered it. Other stores had no longer offered it and made the change on their mobile site. This location did not make the change until a month later. (Yes, I kept a keen eye on them). 3. Always out of strawberries for their strawberry acai refresher. Excuse: ""We are never sent strawberries."" Put in an order for goodness sake! 4. Drizzles of caramel always on the outside of the caramel macchiato cup :O 5. Electricity shortages. 6. Drinks seem very diluted compared to other Starbucks locations. Skimping out on the espresso and filling cold drinks up with too much ice or milk! My pink drink always tasted like diluted strawberry flavored water and when I was finished with my drink, my cup was still 50% full of ice :( 7. Baristas are always chit chatting and messing with on another while the customers patiently await their drinks.  I have always given this Starbucks location a chance time after time, but after todays oppsies, I will not be returning and I hope you do not either. Drive yourself down a couple blocks and there will surely be another Starbucks ready to make your drink tastier and with a smile :)",-1,-1
"Terrible drive through experience.  Terrible service.  We were prepared for a long wait the line at the drive-in was crazy but we weren't prepared for every food item we ordered to be out, after specifically asking if it was available. To top that off the substitutions we were offered were also out.  Insult to injury this is the second Las Vegas Starbucks I have been to that refused to make items off the secret menu. Really?? Every other city I have been to will serve a grasshopper frapachino... I will not be back to this store and I am filling a complaint with corporate.",-1,-1
"Drive thru is slooooooow, inside is slooooooow. I could roast my own beans by the the time it takes to get a drink here.  There can be 4 cars in the drive thru and its 10-15 min some days!",-1,-1
They made me one heck of a drink but it shouldn't take 30 minutes for that. I got in like at 2:10 in the drive thru. Ordered my drink at 2:29 l. Got to the window at 2:35. Left at 2:40. Quite ridiculous,-1,-1
"This is quite possibly the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. If you actually get the drink you order, in a reasonable amount of time, at the temperature you requested (hot vs. iced), and not too sweet or burned, it is an abnormal day. The place is typically packed with taxi drivers and other locals sitting around at the tables playing on their phones for hours. The staff is new or unprofessional. I once watched one employee dump ice into the bin, spilling it onto the counter and walk away coyly from (who I assumed) her manager. This is not a place you would want to come for a chat, to work or relax. Overall, unless you are going through drive thru and you don't care how your coffee tastes, go somewhere else....like the one in Boca Park.",-1,-1
"I'm from Seattle. I love coffee, and I'm a huge Starbucks fan..gold card, daily customer, etc...   But what's happening at THIS location makes for a miserable experience. The drive-thru is terribly, terribly slow. More often than not, it's a 20 min wait in the morning. I've witnessed one drive-thru employee talking, laughing, after handing out the customers drink, with the line still piled up behind me. No apology. You need to leave home an extra 30 mins for your visit to Starbucks in the morning..   Going inside isn't much better or faster, dirty floors, tables, not to mention trying to navigate past the pan-handlers that are stationed at/near the doors. I gave up on this location. If you value your sanity, drive to another Starbucks.   I hate to be harsh, but whoever is managing this store should be fired.",-1,-1
"Staffing issues, management? Haven't seen only 3 workers at the counters at Starbucks in ages. Can't keep up with the volume.",-1,-1
How does any female feel safe at this location with all the African migrant men hanging around?,-1,-1
"Worst Starbucks ever!  Seriously,  worst service and takes a minimum of 20 minutes for your drink...and not because it's crowded,  because there that slow... tried it several times and always at least 15 minutes for 1 order...",-1,-1
"Horrible food but they are open 24hours. I'd love to say nicer things about this place because it's just down the street from my house, but they really have gotten lazy over the years.  Used to be good fresh made food, but now everything is premade and not worth eating.  I suppose it is nice to put in your order and have it in 5 minutes, but the trade off is it was likely made the day before and just tossed on the grill to warm.   Because it is open all night they are busy when the bars close, but drunk people are not very picky.  Anyways, about all I would recommend here is a coffee if you are up late, good luck getting a refill though, the staff don't pay much attention.",-1,-1
Worst rude service ....Disgusting foods....salty left over heated burned creamy chicken soup .... Nasty undercook sausages....gross!!!,-1,-1
"Worst place for breakfest nothing special and really really expensive.  Everything is generic and the own is this greek or italian guy with a pony tail whos really really rude and doesnt care about his customers.  I had the burger once, it was one of those frozen burgers u can find at any store for 25cents a peice. It had a dry bun and old veggies that have been sitting around for a while.  This place is loaded with gangster wanna bees and thugs STAY AWAY!!!!!!!",-1,-1
"Went here for a midnight fix of all-day-breakfast. The food was just alright, but nothing great. My girlfriend had found not only one strand of hair on her plate while munching, but two! As anyone would expect, she lost her appetite right after.",-1,-1
"wow this place is a dump, I was dragged here twice...  once for breakfast only. We came after 11pm, so it was the all-day breakfast price, which was pretty high for a couple of eggs, sausage and fries. It was blah, it was plain old breakfast, what did I expect? the waitress kept forgetting my drink order... Just a cup of OJ please? didn't come till I almost finished my breakfast. nothing special to note, but it wasn't horrible.  So I came back again for dinner (let's just say I will never EVER come back here again) I don't understand why there is so many elderly people dining here when the food is so HARD, GREASY and UNHEALTHY.  My friend said he saw a $16.99 T-bone steak special and wanted to come and try... OK, except we came on a Saturday and it's not on special, so he ordered it anyways for $22.99 ($6 more) I order a half rack of ribs (I have no idea why, since it's NOT a smoke house or anything?)  the meals came with salad or soup and a couple of garlic toast.  The Caesar salad was overly dressed, and the house salad was plain to the max (with your choice of dressing)  The ribs came and it was HARD as a rock! I ate one rib, and my friend tried one and that was it. The home style potatoes was I guess? I've had better ribs from swiss chalet (and I'm not a fan of this place either)  The T-Bone steak was such bad quality I'm not sure if it is SAFE to eat medium-rare? My friend finished it anyways since he was hungry.  Let's just say he had bad news when he talked to me the next day (something like going to the washroom in the middle of the night) and he is usually able to take anything.  This place is dirty and food is gross.",-1,-1
"The worst place I've ever been to. To start, a busser splashed dirty water at my friend and I. They apologized so we let it go. But they didn't even give us napkins after we got wet.  When they sat us at the table, there were crumbles all over the seats and oil stains everywhere. I had to go to the washroom and get toilet paper and soap to clean it myself.  Our server was nothing special. She did not smile. She got us refills but she has not really present. We tried to ask other servers for service to order or napkins only to get yelled at. One server said in an angry tone that they are very busy and to go ask someone else because there are different sections.  This restaurant has below average food. The servers are terrible and don't smile. There is no sense of teamwork what so ever. Every server is for themselves here. They do not prioritize the guest's needs. Rather they put themselves first.  I have worked in a restaurant for 5 years. I noticed that the servers had a 5-6 table section on labour day. They do not walk that fast. They do not have full hands in and out of the kitchen. I will not be coming back here. This server even yelled at my friend and said she does not understand how the restaurant works.   A tip: bring a raincoat because they will splash dirty water at you.",-1,-1
"Terrible service!  I would give this place a negative if Yelp would let me!  We waited more than 30 mins for our food and they serves us with the wrong order.  We asked about our order since it was wrong  and the waiter said ""it's okay, the chef does what he wants.""  In addition, we were in the middle of eating our food and our waiter rushed to clean up our table.   He was extremely rude and didn't even let us enjoy the wrong order of food.   Never coming to this place ever again!",-1,-1
"If only there was a way to rate this restaurant as zero stars. My friend and I were ignored at the door by a server writing 'no separate bills, no debit' on a blackboard. We were seated only to be ignored by our server who was rude. We went in there hungry and ready to eat and after seeing that I couldn't order what I wanted (a grilled chicken salad) we finally called it quits and walked out. This was the third strike Markham Station. I won't be going back.",-1,-1
"I am a bit disappointed in my most recent trip to Markham Station. It was around 7:30pm on a weekend night, lots of empty seats. We ordered the Mozzarella Sticks which were really good and I would get those again. However, I ordered the Steak Sandwich which was just a strip of ""steak"" stuck in-between 2 slices of italian bread with lettuce and tomato on the side. HP sauce couldn't fix the bland taste of that steak. My friend ordered the Pork Souvlaki, although they give you a lot of food for the $15, it was not worth it.   We didn't finish some of our food because of the quantity and the (lack of) taste and the waitress asked us why. Really?   I would still come back here because it's convenient and just for breakfast, but I will still ignore the staffs' nosey comments.",-1,-1
"I thought about giving this place 1 star but because their breakfast is pretty good I gave it 2. A lot of people are complaining about the food and I'm surprised more ppl are not complaining about the service. There's one server there who sits and chats with customers and she doesn't come around to see how anything is, you literally have to go up to her and ask for whatever you need. And when you want your receipt none of them are anywhere in sight.   If you have a lot of time to wait for refills your bill etc then this is a good place to go, if you wanna be in and out this is not a good place.",-1,-1
"Sometimes you just crave greasy diner food, coupled with rude service in the dead of the night, surrounded by questionable clientele. Markham Station has it all. Too expensive for what it is though.  PS - they charge $1.50 for hot water. Sketchy move",-1,-1
If you like to get heart attack from eating breakfast. This is the place to go.  It use to be good like 15 years ago. Now this is just a hole.   Even they say breakfast special $3.99 you bill will usually come up to 10 bucks per person.   The whole place smell like you are in the kitchen. After you finish your meal you will want to go home and change. Unless you like walk around smelling like breakfast.   :-),-1,-1
Terrible service overall need to train there staff in customer service the food is not that great,-1,-1
"Extremely bad food.    The black lady waitress gave us an attitude when I pointed out her bad service this very early morning.   I talked to her why we were not happy with her service politely and calmly, but she talked me back without apology.  She also raised her voice toward us.  As an excuse, she said to us her shift was over long time ago, but she had to be there for her co-worker.    So what?     I did not give her tips after all this conversation.   She behaved worse after.",-1,-1
"This place has seriously gone downhill.  I used to come here often, seeing as how it was 24 hours and a good price for all day breakfast.   The food has gone south. Had the steak and eggs for $13.99 and it was disgusting. I could go to T-Bonez and get an 8oz steak dinner for $13.99. The eggs were really dry. The steak was really dry. Everything was really dry.  Our meals came with toast, and no jam! We were told we had to pay 20 cents per pod of jam. Hello? I think that if you're going to serve toast, the least you can do it provide you one pod of jam. Then charge extra for additional.  The service was bleh too, I mean I guess you sort of expect it from a place like this. But our server asked only one person if they wanted white or brown toast. And then asked another person if they wanted home fries or something else. Aren't you supposed to ask everyone?  Bad experience. Won't come back.",-1,-1
"Atmosphere: Big restaurant, lacks warmth, needs a major facelift  Food:  1. breakfast speciall. 1/5 , 4.99 special, makes me wish i spent it on Tim Hortons instead. Bread was so buttery that it was no longer toasted, sausages were dry. Display of the food was so unappealing.   Overal: we found food still stuck on the utensils, will most definitely not be back",-1,-1
"Horrible service.  Arrived as a group - called days ahead - and they would not accommodate individual billing and were not staffed for a large group.  For a place that advertises fast service it took nearly 90 minutes for our group to get served.  Too 45min for drinks alone.   Multiple people cancelled orders and left because we had younger children in our group who after 90 minutes of waiting the time of day had become too late for them.  I had ordered the western sandwich and a milkshake.  The food was sub par, bland, and mostly uninteresting.   One of my fellow diners had a fly in their salad and another took 2 hours to get a glass of coke.  Service was rude and indignant from the one server who handled a group of 40.  She consistently complained about too many people and not having her coffee yet.  I'm not sure how this is the diner's problem.  Even after getting our food it took 30 or more minutes to get bills.  Even after all this she automatically added 10% tip to the bills.  TL;DR = Don't go here. Bad food, bad service. Legitimately the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.",-1,-1
"I think my reaction to this place is ""Meh"", but I come back whenever I'm in the area because I like breakfast food.  Staff: It was easy to get a seat, and they took our order quickly but then for the most of the time we did not see our waitress, so getting the bill took some time. But they were not busy at all, in fact the wait staff was chatting with each other most of the time.  Ambience: It felt dirty. The spoon I had was unclean, as if it was licked clean, rather than washed clean. The seats were sticky, and the place definitely looked like it could use some sprucing up. It doesn't have that nostalgic or home-like feel, so it just felt drabby.  Food: It was alright. I had ordered their lunch special where you get toast, eggs, sausage or bacon, and home fries. I wanted over-medium eggs but they came as over-well. I opted for sausage which were nice. They only had strawberry jam to go with your toast, which was disappointing. Overall it was nothing too memorable but I was full by the end of the meal. Also, apparently hot water is like $1+, which I didn't see in the menu so it was my fault. I do think that it could've been free though.  It's alright, but I wouldn't seek it out.",-1,-1
"After a long night of partying, our group was tired and famished. Desperate for food, we luckily spotted Markham Station. All we wanted was something cheap and filling; this establishment filled that void in our stomachs. Markham Station had a very expansive menu including an all day breakfast menu. The food was plentiful but cheap, in which was reflected in quality. I ordered the well-done steak which was great, the eggs okay, but the fries were horrible. The interior likewise reflected the pricing of the menu; bland, few colours, but lots of windows. Service was slow and not very friendly. The crowd too seemed a bit sketchy but that maybe because we went at 2am. All and all, this place is like a downgraded Golden Grill. Open 24 hours, cheap but expansive menu with deplorable service and atmosphere. Dine here only if you are desperate for a filling meal at 2am!",-1,-1
"About the only thing it has going for it is that it's open 24-hours which is a rarity in that part of the city. The menu is extensive, but I get the impression that the reason they're able to do this is that a lot of things are frozen. The breakfast food is better than the rest of the menu I find. If you're hungry, it's late, you don't feel like asian food or driving to a better option downtown (like 7 West or Fran's) then it'll do.",-1,-1
"I went to this restaurant for brunch for the first time. From the outside, it seems a good choice  However, when I got the order, it tuns out a wrong wrong wrong choice! The food tasted terrible! Eggs tasted like plastic, no mention about the fronze bacon and werid home made potota. I stop eating and left 99% of the food on my plate. What wrose was the bad customer service, or no customer service. I end up left the restaurant and no tip. Yes, the terrible food + bad customer service, do not worth a penny of any tip. Never never go there.",-1,-1
"Someone recommended this all day breakfast restaurant so I've decided to go and check it out. The service was awful. The waitress treated me as if I wasn't there. I've ordered a soup and breakfast but my soup never showed up and they served with wrong food. At the end, one of the complementary candies was missing. I will not go back.",-1,-1
The quality of this place has been going down hill over the years. Its just a cheap place to get a 4.99 breakfast from 6am-11am. Nothing more nothing less.  They do not have debit machines.,-1,-1
"This place is cheap and dirty.   My work comes here for breakfast 3 times a year and the place always leaves me feeling sick to my stomach. I don't think it's food poisoning but a normal person cannot handle that much grease. After learning my lesson a couple times with their traditional breakfast or omlette, I have switched my order to a bagel and fruit bowl which is only mildly better. I usually find a few pieces of over ripe fruit in the mix.  This place is somewhere I'd never choose to go on my own, but if all you're looking for is the absolute cheapest option, you may have found your place because the portions in the breakfasts are a decent size.  Anyway, my recommendation would be to skip this place unless you love your grease served with a little egg and bacon. YUCK!",-1,-1
"Not sure what's happened to this spot but the quality of the food has gone way down. Just left with my meal half eaten bc it was pretty much inedible. After ordering out meals, my gf and I were shocked at how fast our meals arrived, but were disgusted when everything we bit into was cold.. After getting the servers attention, she was kind enough to take them back and and again she was out quickly with our ""new orders"".  These new meals were definitely hot, but the problem was there were the exact same meals we had sent back. The salt and pepper we had added were still there and nothing had moved...   What kind of restaurant serves their customers cold eggs and then just reheats the dishes.. It's bad enough the food had been obviously sitting for a while, but then to just try to pass it off as new meals is ridiculous.  Needless to say that was my last visit to Markham Station",-1,-1
"When you have a table next to the bussing station, please be considerate and do not slam the dishes when you're putting them away. All the clanging made it hard for me to hear and eventually gave me a headache. In addition, there was a questionable spill on the floor of my booth as well as my seat.   The food was alright. Typical breakfast for a decent price.",-1,-1
"I normally like these kinds of places, but this place disappointed me.  Had the station fries cheese (fries with monterey jack cheese, plus a small container of gravy). The melted cheese was already cold by the time we got it. The gravy they gave us was far too small. There was nothing special about the fries. I don't think this dish was worth the money. Reviewing the menu now, I didn't even know it was supposed to have bacon!  My main was a light caesar burger. The burger patty was slightly burnt. The caesar dressing was watery and had little taste. The burger came with lots of toppings including lettuce, pickle and tomatoes. The burger bun was cold. Overall, also a disappointment.  The food also took a while to come out. At least service was friendly.  I'd only come back again if I was hungry and it was the middle of the night and everything else was closed. Actually, maybe not - I'd just go to McDonald's.",-1,-1
"The only good thing about this place is the music and memories I've had here. This used to be the only breakfast restaurant I knew of that was open 24 hours until I came along a more affordable, better-tasting one called Honey B Hive.   Only come to Markham Station if you have a lot of time to waste. The food takes forever and the staff are not attentive at all. Even getting a table takes long when it is not busy. The food is a bit overpriced but it is not bad.   The only thing that ticked me off the last time I came here was this one waitress who had no adequate manners whatsoever and just reached for my baby, touching her face and who knows where else before we could even say anything. Mind you, she has quite intense allergies that the waitress could have easily had contact to. When we said something the second time she did it, she didn't apologize and just stomped off. By the way, we asked to switch waiters but they told us it's by section so we just let it go and ate quickly so we could leave.   It is extremely rude to touch someone without their permission especially if that person doesn't have a voice of their own yet and obviously would not like strangers touching them in any way just as we would not enjoy strangers touching us. Markham Station is unprofessional in general (their other waiters aren't much better - they are usually talking loudly amongst themselves instead of noticing customers calling for their attention), but after this experience, I don't think I will ever come back.",-1,-1
"Expensive ! Just don't buy any overly priced drinks. Below average service. Unless they change, no second time.",-1,-1
"Horrible food. Horrible service. Two thumbs down. Will never go here again.  The food was greasy, bland, and disgusting. How do they screw up eggs and toast? The waitress was extremely rude. She told us to hurry up and leave because her shift was ending. When I brought my complaint to the manager, he didn't care and was outright rude. If that's how they think they'll keep customers then keep it up.  I will never go to this place again and I tell everyone I know to stay away. I hope they go out of business so that others won't have to be subjected to their garbage food and garbage attitude. They don't even deserve one star but there's no option for zero.",-1,-1
Sitting down with food in front of me in under 10 mins!!!  And that's where it ends...I needed a quick breakfast and was in the area so I stopped in.  It's nothing special; I can make this at home.  It was quick & cheap & not McDonalds.,-1,-1
"Came here on a Sunday morning for some breakfast... 2nd time around and i have to say i should have paid the extra money and went to coras.   I got the western omelette and it was dry, their hash brown was dry. Its a sad meal when ketchup cant even save the meal. 20cents for jam... I couldn't even enjoy jam on my white toast that i didn't get asked whether i wanted white or brown.   Oh yes and i felt bad for my friend as i started to realize that the server instead of asking for help stacked my plate on top of hers. So i got some steak sauce on the side of my plate.   Not a place ill be coming back again.",-1,-1
"Use to be good, used to be my favourite.  Now...forget it.  The servers are rude and the food is disgusting.",-1,-1
"Went here after a night out on the town with a group of friends.  Having been to similar breakfast / diner type places, I can't say that I was overly impressed with the food here.  I ordered the cajun burger, which game with fries, and was ok -- it satisfied my hunger pangs without stuffing me, but really wasn't anything to rave about.  I may end up back here to meet up with friends after hours, but it wouldn't be my choice of venue.",-1,-1
"I went there multiple times. Every time its a disappointment and i can say this is the least disappointing visit so far . Food is outdated and tastes weird. Their fries, bread, and eggs always taste old,dry,and bland. Not the best service too.",-1,-1
"Went on a Monday morning, and again on Thursday morning.  Both times, decent food, especially the breakfast special.  However both times also horrid waiters--different waiters, but learned from the same school of rudeness--let us stand at the front about 5 minutes while chatting with other employees, then grunted and pointed to a table for us to go to.  Both times the forks were dirty (spoons and knives OK) and we had to ask the waiter to sweep the crumbs off the seats.  We noticed the waitresses were friendly and efficient, but the waiters were the opposite.  We had to go get the waiter to get coffee refills.  Washrooms were tiny and filthy; no TP in the men's.  The first time we tipped as usual, assuming the waiter just had a bad day.  The second time we gave our tip to one of the waitresses who noticed we needed more coffee even though it wasn't her table.  The roasted potatoes were really good, but the home fries were very dry and tasted like they were over baked frozen potatoes.",-1,-1
"I came here to appease my family when they suggested this place a day for breakfast.  After my last experiences i was determined to avoid this place.  Edible enough food with spotty service on weekends. Basically Your staple breakfast foods (eggs, homefries, sausage, toast and coffee).   My one major peeve is the lack of quicker service on my past 2 visits this year. Moreover the quality of service. The coffee comes with free refills, when I was a kid I recall the servers coming by frequently. I had to flag the servers down multiple times for this. The servers are polite, but I guess it's difficult to manage on busier days?   I come here, think of my childhood, come With my parents. I guess it's tradition, but I remember it being way way better. But I think it's time I convince my brother to love Eggsmart more than this place.",-1,-1
"Lovely server, awful food. Came Thursday afternoon, so place wasn't busy. Ordered eggs with home fries, toast, and sausage. Came out incredibly quickly but the food was cold. Got the server to take it back but again it came out quickly and clearly the food had just been reheated - I could see where I had eaten from and the pepper I had added. Maybe we needed to specify we wanted fresh food?? Lost my appetite. Never returning.",-1,-1
"I asked for a croissant and they gave me a pretzel bun. They have knock off sweetners for Equal and Sweet N Low that just say sweetener the don't' say that they are no calorie sweetners so I didn't know if they were sugar or what.  The electronic order system is confusing unless you want one of the few things on the main screen. I just wanted an espresso, I looked through all the menus for a few minutes to try and find it, after that I just asked the lady for help.",-1,-1
Was strongly thinking about getting a membership here being that it is very close to my house. I have been a golds member in the past. was really not all that impressed with the facility. the customer service was terrible i honestly felt like i was buying a used car! I think im gonna save the money and work out for free at Nellis AFB and just make the drive over there instead.,-1,-1
"OOOOHHHHH man.... only getting worse.  The staff are circling the drain while the new gym members are getting younger and younger.  Yea, cool, have kids understand fitness instead of sitting on the couch, but most of the equipment these kids don't need to be around.... so if you want to teach kids fitness, why not have a class or designated area for them instead of random kids everywhere.  If I had to go and find a decent human being working at this location to talk to about every single thing that was wrong in this gym, I'd be $hit outta luck, not to mention I'm not doing the job of 25+ people, if no one can handle working at the gym, I'm sure there is some other 15 year old that can stand at the front desk and play on their cell phones all night.",-1,-1
"THEY CHARGED ME OVER $150 FOR 3 MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP, APPLICATION FEES, AND CENCELLATION FEES WHEN i NEVER RECIVED A FRICKEN MEMBERSHIP CARD. So basically i was never a member and NEVER used the gym! This review is also going to the BBB, Facebook, twitter, instagram, Gold's Gym corporate CEO and referencing the Fair Credit Billing Act per the Federal Trade Commision for undelived service or goods.  If you want to be cheated and scammed out of your money for trying to be a member, apply for membership.",-1,-1
"I should have headed the warnings about Golds billing practices.  Golds policy is to charge a ""rate lock fee"" after  you have been a member for 120 days.  I canceled my membership per their 31 day notice policy, at less than 120 of total membership.  They still billed my account the $39 rate lock fee.  I disputed the charge and they told me I have to cancel within 60 days in order for my membership to expire before 120 days.  That is not what the contract that I signed states.  It clearly states must provide 31 day notice within 120 days to avoid rate lock fee.  This is why Golds is losing business and has gone from ""the"" gym to empty parking lots.  I highly recommend NOT JOINING.",-1,-1
"This gym is terrible. I have a membership here and at LVAC and I am just waiting until the new LVAC opens on Decatur and the 2-15 to cancel my membership at Gold's because this place is a joke. There are only 5 Stair Master machines and at least one is always broken. The others are hardly functional and can't seem to keep a steady pace. Honestly, I think that might be a safety hazard in itself. I've mentioned it to the desk and they're still not working properly. On top of that, it seems like a new machine is out of commission downstairs every day as well. I can never seem to get in a complete workout because something I want to use ALWAYS happens to be broken. Also, the selection of machines as well as the quality of the machines here is deplorable. This membership costs me more monthly than LVAC ever has and I am 100% unsatisfied. Counting the minutes until the new LVAC opens.",-1,-1
well my wife and i have definitely been to way better gyms but....this is where we live now very close to here and its convenient and its got a pool for me too swim......but the staff are always preoccupied and seem so upset when you ask them for something like you just asked a stranger for 10000000 dollars.....its pretty annoying...as far as the facility its very nice pretty clean and impressive with how much equipment they have available.....but its still not enough for how many people show up there from about 4pm -8pm....its just a serious pain to get a machine at that time....,-1,-1
"Ok, so I may have jinxed myself when I said I had no customer service issues in my previous review. When I first started going to this gym I was told I could use the same locker and keep my stuff it just make sure I had a lock on it and it would be fine. I was not able to go to the gym for a couple of weeks and when I returned to the gym I noticed my lock was gone. I went to the front desk and the clerk tells me that the manager had them go in and clear out all of the lockers and he could not find my stuff and they threw a lot of stuff out, which I was a little irritated about but it was just a pair of shoes I needed to replace anyways and a few other things. However the guy at the front desk just didnt seem to care that my stuff was thrown out. About a month has passed and I then get a call from a rude collections lady saying I owe all this money for not paying for my personal trainer (I had inquired about personal training previously) I attempted to tell the lady from collections that the lady I spoke with about personal training told me that to hold the price I just needed to sign the paperwork so she could get me in the system but me paying the amount due is what locks me into the contract but I had to pay within the next couple of days, I decided not to do the personal training and even told the lady I did the paperwork with I was not going to do it. The lady from collections told me that I had to talk to the manager about it. I called and spoke with the manager of this location and he told me he would look into it and contact me back. This was about a month and a half ago, I have called him and left several messages and he is always""in a meeting"" How are you supposed to manage your store if you are in meetings all day every day. I even purposely called every hour one day and of course he was busy each time I called. I like the gym and the staff for the most part if you have an issue you better hope you do not have to speak with the manager because apparently he is not there for the customers he is there for the meetings and his lunch breaks.",-1,-1

Victor the manager at the Gold's Gym in Las Vegas is arbitrarily charging for fees that aren't listed. When Victor spoke to me he had a mouthful of food. I waited nearly 10 minutes to speak to someone. Victor told me that I needed to pay an extra $10.00 a month to use the tanning beds. I've been going to Gold's Gym for months, yet no one told me about this. In fact, when I signed up, the salesperson told me I wouldn't have to pay an additional money to use the facilities other than the day care and spin classes. That was a lie to get my membership.",-1,-1
"I toured the gym 9/2013, the facility and the equipment were everything you could want in a gym... I wanted to sign up for a year and pay in advance.... the salesman Fernando  told me they can't take cash in advance?? it was like trying to by a car ... he went to his manager 3 times,  in the end I walked out and went to Express fitness paid for a year in advance.... they let me walk because I wouldn't give them access to my credit card",-1,-1
"Very disappointed in this place.  Has gotten ghetto and dirty.  There was an altercation with 2 guys where it broke out into a big agreement And THE STAFF DID NOTHING. I talked to one of the guys and he said They didnt do anything because it wasn't their problem IT'S YOUR GYM! AVOID coming here.  Too many little kids ""working out."" Weights left all over.  Ghetto ppl But it's now only 10 bucks to sign up So I shouldn't be surprised.",-1,-1
"I originally transferred from 24 Hour Fitness off of Ann Rd, because I moved to the north side. I actually wish I never did.  My top 3 complainants about this gym:  1. Teenagers are EVERYWHERE!!!  Don't plan to get a good workout during the summer time when they are out of school. All they do is work out in groups of like 5 and sit on the equipment all day.   2. Equipment is terrible and old. Most of the Free Motion Machine equipment is either missing the proper attachment handles or rigged together in an unsafe manner. This is actually embarrassing, especially when the gym charges you a yearly monthly maintenance fee...what a joke.  3. The dirtiest locker room I've every experienced. If you like to change in a dirt locker room with trash all over the place, then this is the spot for you.  Bottom line, if you can treat yourself, spend the extra money and go to 24 Hour Fitness off of Ann. Military, I would just go the Warrior Fitness Center on base...for real!",-1,-1
"CAUTION!!! Do not sign a contract with Golds Gym!!! After my contract was over they still continued to charged my credit card.  A month after my contract ended I got a new credit card because mine was stolen, I did not alert golds gym because my contract had already ended.  Little did I know that they were still charging me every month after the contract ended.  I got a call from a collection agency, when I called the manager at the gym to get some answers it took 3 days just to get a call back.  Once I got a call back I was told that there was nothing they could do for me and I needed to just take it up with the collections person.  I was told from the agency that I owed $229.00, I asked the gym manager what I was being charged for and she said 3 months of missed payments which would of only been $65.00. So how they came up with $229.00 I don't know.  But I will never deal with Golds gym again and I send a caution to anyone thinking about it.",-1,-1
"The gym itself is nice but trying to cancel the membership is a NIGHTMARE.  Read the fine print about cancelling before you sign up or you will continue to be billed, even after you TRY to cancel.  They use a 3rd party for billing.  If you call the # it says to email them.  It took 2 weeks of constant emails to finally get someone to respond.  My 1st email was within the 31 day required cancellation but they went off of the last email received and said I would still be charged an additional months fee.",-1,-1
"The monthly price is wonderful, that being said they spend the rest of your membership trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of you. I tried to change my payment date and was told that the only way to do so was to cancel my membership, pay the cancellation fee and come back on the day of the month that I want my payment to be, re sign up and pay another ""annual fee"" of $39 even though I just paid that when I signed up three months before. Oh, and don't forget your towel. If you don't have one you have to buy one of theirs for a dollar, just another way that they grab at our wallets. I'm not even going to get into the pain that cancelling the membership is and the extra costs that they tack on. The cheap monthly cost isn't even worth it because the gym is always packed, even at 5am. I'm so happy that I'm finished with Gold's.",-1,-1
"I joined this gym in January with my fiancÃ©. It was crowded but everyone expects that when you join a gym in January! It was a great experience then. The cardio cinema is really great. I wanted to do my review after about 5 months to get the full picture. Well the place is now so overcrowded with people just standing around and the people there are what people warn you about with North Las Vegas. Not comfortable at all coming except to go to a class and leave. I would not go there just to work alone any more. Also, there really needs to be a timer for the movies because on more than one occasion I had to actually call the front desk to ask for someone to come and restart the movie!! Sad to see this awesome gym go down hill so quickly.",-1,-1
"This place is kinda dirty, to be honest. The machines/equipment aren't well kept. Everything is coated with dust that settles on to the sweat/bodily fluids that get on the machines.  The gym that I used to go to in the Bay Area (California), was probably older than this gym, but so much cleaner.  Besides that, you pretty much have everything you need here to get where you want to be here to get the job done. There's also a swimming pool... But I wouldn't want to swim in there.",-1,-1
Even in  late night the place is full.  There is too many people endless place to work out.  they have To make this place bigger.,-1,-1
Horrible misrepresentation of fees.  I asked on the phone what ALL the fees would be and was only told  $10 to join and $25 for the month. I would NEVER pay more than $25 a month.  I go down to the gym and then get told there is an ANNUAL fee of $40.  They are hiding the enrollment fee as an annual fee.,-1,-1
"I have been a member of this gym since it opened. I used to really like this gym, but am seriously considering switching to the new LVAC opening on Decatur and the 215. Every summer the A/C breaks down. Lately, the Cardio Theatre treadmills have been out of commission and the gym itself has been way too hot. I'm surprised they actually have the stair masters fixed correctly. They are often also out of paper towels and disinfectant spray. The ladies' restroom stalls can be very messy on Sunday's too. While before I would recommend this gym to anyone in the North Las Vegas area, I cannot say the same now.",-1,-1
"Gold's Gym is garbage now. They lowered their prices to $10 a month and now they are always packed. The equipment is never clean and the staff are tools. Now they are trying to nickel and dime people by making towels mandatory and charging for their towels. How about you clean your own machines?! I didn't sign up to be your janitor. At the very least, keep your bleach bottles full! LVAC is a way better gym. I can't wait for the new one to open on 215 and N. Decatur.",-1,-1
Place deserves no stars! It's dirty! No one wipes down there machines the lack of care for place shows on worn beat up equipment! I joined for the theater sole reason! They never change the movies! Start them when it ends! Follow the schedule of movie that should be now playing! They are e treacly rude the just walk in and turn on lights for whatever reason! They shut it down at 945 not 10pm! They charge the SAME price as LVAC with zero services!,-1,-1
"My 12 oz sirloin was at least 4oz of fat. Gross. Pathetic, really.  Also pathetic, someone from the kitchen delivered food to another patron. The patron asked a question, and the kitchen attendant answered the question while walking away, making zero eye contact.  Poor product. Poor service.",-1,-1
WOW. Walked in and waited for fifteen minutes and never got seated! ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. Can't comprehend how that happens.,-1,-1
"How hard is it to get an order right? Is it possible to get a food order served on a plate commensurate in size to the food being plated? If you are notified that the food delivered is wrong, is it too much to expect an apology, and not hear ""I've never actually looked at the menu"" (sly look, wink, wink, nod nod...like it's some funny inside joke). There's a reason I've not been to an Applebee's for years...nice to see that some things just never change. The food was passable, my rack of ribs jammed onto a too small rectangular plate with broccoli and the wrong kind of fries (ordered the garlic fries, not plain), the waitress displayed not a care that the fries were wrong, and quite frankly I don't do lemme fix it - get it right the first time...that is your job. Corporate culture, staff training...fail.",-1,-1
I've never been to a restaurant quite disorganized than this one. From the moment I  arrived the wait staff seemed to be very flustered. A lot of complaining from the servers about how many people were in their placed in their sections and bickering. It's very distracting and obnoxious when customers are trying to eat. The service was very slow considering my drink order wasn't even taken for 10 minutes after I was seated.  Food was average for this type of restaurant.The most distributing behavior was when the manager corrected a server on the floor. People were walking past and I even noticed it since I was sitting near the kitchen and heard every word. Very unprofessional. One would think you'd pull that person into a room but apparently that's not how this Applebee's works. Won't be returning.,-1,-1
"We have gone here often in the past , today's visit will be our last visit. The prices have gone up, the portions have gotten smaller and it seems the quality of the food is not as good. Four of us dined this evening, 3 ordering steaks that had no flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were bland as well. On top of all of that, we went early to beat the dinner rush and the service was HORRIBLE. We had to ask for silverware after the food came, our drinks were never refilled and the waitress never asked how anything was. Time to find a new go to place, because this one is DONE.",-1,-1
"Our first visit to this new Applebee's restaurant.  First was disappointed that they do not use any apps for reservations.  However in hindsight I don't think that they'll need it... Based on my first visit I doubt that they will be very busy.  As always my first litmus test in my ordering a nice Guinness draft... Nope ... Not only no Guinness, but no dark beers on draft.  Strike 1  Found a nice looking shrimp Thai salad... And asked about soup... None that I cared for, so I asked for chilli... Nope ... No chilli... Strike 2  Wife ordered a meal and a side salad... A lengthily discussion ensued due to the fact that they do not have any common dressings ... Finally got the honey balsamic... Little did we know that it really didn't matter... We never got the salad! ... Strike 3  When our meals arrived I would have loved my wife to have taken a picture of my face... In the large shallow dish was the smallest $11 salad I've ever seen... It was about 5 inches in diameter... And an inch deep... With 6 shrimp.  About 8 forks and I was done. Wow... Strike 4  The waiter didn't ask if we would like dessert, and its just as well as we couldn't wait to get out of the place.  Have to add the fact that of the 4 flat screens that I could see... 2 displayed nothing... Broken? ... Don't know... The one that I had the best view of had kdka news on ... How entertaining...   Another funny thing that I'll remember... While waiting for our food... And that salad that never arrived... We had been sitting for 10 minutes with 2 glasses of water...  The waiter stopped by and asked ""how is everything?"" ... I replied that the ice water was great.  My wife said that my reply was mean... I told her that I disagreed... If I wanted to be mean I would have told the waiter that I ordered ice water with lemon and didn't get the lemon.  Another disappointing restaurant in Murrysville... Too bad.",-1,-1
"Food was awfulllllllllllll!!  Beer was good. Cold and fast.  Food was worse than TV dinners. Absolutely nothing at all like the TV commercial that brought me into the restaurant for dinner. Sloppy presentation. No taste.   What could be worse? I ordered a salad with chicken to go for my lunch at work the following day. Sooo, at work I remove my salad from the refrigerator and consider eating it. Two other employees asked me about the wilted brown-tipped broccoli in the container. I threw the entire container away without taking a bite. That was about $10-11 including tip tossed in the trash.   Next day after extensive searching for a contact for the Monroeville, PA location, I sent an e-mail describing my excellent beer, pretty good service, mediocre meal not finished and the terrible salad packaged to-go. There was no sarcasm at that time, just an honest description of the food and service.  The manager's  response was that I should ask for him or another manager when I returned. No refund offered. No "" come in for a free meal to offset two awful meals previously paid for."" I would not return for a $100.00 gift card.   The experience and response fits Applebee's. Neither are worth consideration. Maybe that is why the restaurant was nearly empty when I visited.   Save your money. Get ""fast food"" instead. That would be better!",-1,-1
"6th time. 1st time horrible meal. Brought wrong order to guest, my pork chop was cooked 2 death. Not edible . Did not comp my dish. I just wanted the cook to use an instant-read thermometer so hopefully the next guest would not get screwed.",-1,-1
Slow service and mediocre food.  Typical chain.,-1,-1
"Don't bother, awful service with no compensation. Food tasted like it was microwaved. Will not go back to that applebees, I'll like West Mifflen applebees though.",-1,-1
"This review is for the tour only, not the beer (which is quite good) or food (which we didn't have). While waiting for the tour, a waitress came over to take our food order. We didn't realize they even served food, we just thought it was a brewery, and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour. Our tour guide Jimmy was drunk. He was staggering around, waving his arms, stumbling over his words (couldn't pronounce Mecklenburg), taking swigs of the Southside Weiss. It was rather like watching Captain Jack Sparrow give a tour, except with beer not rum. It seemed a bit odd and was certainly distracting. Seeing the tanks and everything in the brewery was cool and interesting, but our inebriated tour guide wasn't very knowledgeable. If you want a sampler of their beers, you have to pay, which is ok I guess because the tour is free. I wanted to buy a 6 pack of their summer seasonal Rein Pale Ale, but they didn't have it yet. Memorial Day weekend and you don't have your summer seasonal out yet? They like to tout that the furniture in the brauhaus is from Germany. Who cares? That doesn't affect the taste of the beer. I do like how they adhere to the German purity laws in their beermaking process, though. This ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famous by Germany, and that you are getting quality beer from people who care about their product.",-1,-1
Olde Mecklenburg beer in the Dortmund-style takes some effort to warm up to. Sampled all three currently available the other night and each one had a VERY harsh initial taste. German beer by it's nature typically mellows the Hell out after three or four sips... but not this stuff. Rolled on a second Copper and it finally started to get a tad better. Their winter brew is simply awful. This is really not what a German beer is supposed to be doing to you.   Ordered a bratwurst and while the actual brat was pretty decent it was served up luke warm on top of a cold flavorless white bun. Very sad to experience. Guessing they boil these as it had zero sear marks.  Brewery itself is off in an industrial area very close to I-77. The tap room is done up nicely. Lots of wood and warmth but that only means you'll have to stay there and drink the product.  Lastly make sure you MapQuest this place out for your visit because it'll take at least three employees to direct you there.   Hopefully they'll replace the current brewmaster with someone that's had German beer before. May be just OK to pop in and check out quickly.,-1,-1
I was very disappointed.  A group of us went on a Friday night for live music.  They are in dire need of an interior decorator.  We felt awkward as soon as we walked in the door.  There were basically picnic benches for tables and nothing on the walls.  The beer was good but the atmosphere is lacking.,-1,-1
"Cool looking place. Great ambience. Gives the feeling of a real barber...  However I had a girl at the last chair cut my hair and it was prob worse than someone still in school. I could have done a better job by myself and a mirror. I tried to guide her at the end on how I want. Simple fade and she couldn't figure it out...  The best is she asked if she should fix it? I couldn't have left any faster, how can you fix a fade that you couldn't do riggt the first time? Maybe the guys there are better but I will never return to this place. Biggest waste of $25 and more importantly my time!!",-1,-1
"Decent hair cut, but if you find employees speaking Russian or Greek the entire time offensive,like me this is not the place for you.....haircut should be relaxing, I gave them 2 chances, 2nd time only English I heard was how would u like your cut....sad part is they all speak ENGLISH fluently....miss your homeland maybe you should consider going back....",-1,-1
"I recently moved to the area and tried out this place last month since yelpers had great things to say about it.  The place was very clean and the guys were great, very friendly and entertaining and they offered everyone drinks.   I don't remember what the gentleman's name was but he was on the far end. First of all, I'm Asian and I know my hair can be somewhat hard to cut sometimes. I asked him for a little bit off the top and a tight #1 faded up. Same thing I've gotten for years. I don't think the guy cutting my hair was licensed at all and had no idea how to cut my hair. When I asked for an inch off the length on top, he just took the clippers and shaved the top of my head all the same length. He never once touched a pair of scissors. No layering, no texturizing - just clippers. He did what you would do if you wanted a buzz cut: #1 guard on the clippers front to back all around my head. This is not how you cut hair - that's how you shave a head! When he saw me not liking what he was doing he kept repeating, ""don't worry, don't worry"". I was about ready to just get up and leave with my hair a mess (I should've). I left disgusted with my head looking horrible. I almost went somewhere else to have them fix it, but there really wasn't much hair left to do anything with.   I feel bad for giving them a crappy review since all the guys were very nice and the shop is pretty sweet, but when it comes down to it, at least one of them doesn't know how to cut hair.",-1,-1
"Don't believe Yelp reviews for Scottsdale haircuts.  I've been to two of the top rated ones and both were horrible.  This was by far the worst haircut I have had anywhere in the world.  The shop itself is nice, but the atmosphere is horrible.  Barbers are saying f*ck this and p&ssy that, completely disgusting and terribly unenjoyable.  The barber didn't know what a layer cut was and took several tries to convince him to use scissors instead of a razor - and then he was a bit indignant that he was actually going to have to cut hair rather than just sheep shear it.  Showed me the neckline when he was done and said ""see perfect"" and it looked like a picket fence.  For $30, he didn't even dry my hair at the end.  Just passed the blower over it once and said done.  He didn't pay any attention to my hair when I arrived.  At the end he combed it all forward with no part, instead of back with a part like when I arrived.  Too busy talking about p&ssy to pay any attention.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Only good thing was no appointment needed and a short wait.  Steer clear!",-1,-1
If you have more than 2 people then don't show up hungry.   We had a group of 3 and the hostess put our name on the waiting listing. At the time there was not enough spots to sit at the sushi bar. When enough seats for 3 did open up at the bar the hostess sat 2 people who had just arrived. When asked why we did not get the option to sit at the bar the hostess shrugged us off.   The food was not good enough to overcome the bad start. I didn't feel that the staff was friendly or rude. They seemed busy like worker ants.,-1,-1
"Went in with high expectation and left dissatisfied. Ordered the Beni-Hana (9pieces of nigiri, spicy tuna and tempura) miso soup and a volcano roll with a side of avocado.  1) they charge $2.00 extra for the teeny tiny avocado pieces on the side  2) The service was terrible. Our order wasn't complete and when we asked for a side of fresh wasabi, it never came around.  3) The sushi grade was okay.... Definitely not a 4/5 star restaurant. I will continue my hunt for the best sushi spot in Phoenix",-1,-1
"I heard this place was great so I wanted to try it. Maybe this is a one off but it was a horrendous experience: I called ahead for pick up- though I had given enough time they were still very late (talking 25 minutes real time here) getting it to me. I drove home realized they had given me the wrong order so I went back, the manager wanted the Ngiri I was given by mistake back, to give to another person after it had been in my possession for a good 40 minutes. Gave it back of course, just thought it's weird. And guess what they made me wait another 20 minutes even though I had called when I got home and realized it was the wrong order. Really a bummer because I wanted to try this place and have what otherwise seems a good place for sushi according to most people.",-1,-1
"This is a belated review, but reviewing the other ones, I can see I'm not alone in my absolute disappointment for this place.  We were a party of 2, and I had the dish with the buckwheat noodles. I wanted to try them. When the male server (probably the same notorious dark haired one found in other reviews) came by to ask me how it was, I said I didn't like it. He said, ""you're weird"" and walked away. Who says to their customer they are weird?? I'm supporting this business by coming in here. I'm paying your salary (in part). But apparently it doesn't matter because this place is still in business. Didn't hurt them any when I didn't come back. I also didn't take leftovers home.  Obviously no tip. They were lucky I paid the bill.  Anyone can do better than plunking down $40 here.",-1,-1
"After seeing all the amazing reviews thought of trying it out. Got 2 pieces of nigiri toro one salmon nigiri. Soft shel crab roll and avocado roll. My total was 87 dollars! Yes 87 dollars! I lived in LA for 10 years that is Nobu prices, this is Phx, lol really! This when you know a place thinks it's way better and bigger than it is they lose their way. I actually had to ask the prices to make sure because I was so dumbfounded. Anyways never going to this place and I recommended you don't either if you don't want to get ripped off. Lots of better sushi places for way less money in az!",-1,-1
"Having Hana's quality sushi in my ""hood"" has been a real boon. The food is always good, the restaurant vibe energetic, and the waiters super fun. That's why I was sooooo disappointed to have a bad experience there. Hubby and I went out for dinner recently and were told by the host that the two open tables were now being reserved for walk-ins of parties of 4 only because, ""we make more money off them."" That's exactly what he said. He told us that something at the sushi bar was sure to open up soon. Thirty minutes later and still waiting, we now had a growing crowd of two's on the wait list. A party of three walked in and were seated IMMEDIATELY. We should have walked out right then, but we were so hungry we figured it couldn't be much longer. Wrong. We waited another 20 minutes until a table finally opened up. Meanwhile, the table for four remained empty. This is a BAD policy. Seating should be first-come, first-served. I will only be doing takeout there from now on.  The food is 4 star. The wait policy is 1 star.",-1,-1
"I had better, maybe went on a bad night. Maybe I should have asked for recommendations. But my food was blah. Nothing out of this world. Disappointing, but  after reading the reviews, maybe I should go back and try it again.",-1,-1
"Maybe this place is ok if your idea of good sushi is a Las Vegas roll and the closest you've been to Japan is Peoria, but if you've been to California, Hawaii, or Japan, this will not meet even your lowest expectations.   I've lived in Japan for several months while studying there and have been back numerous times, so I can have high standards for Japanese food. I understand standards are lower here in Phoenix, but still I've had far better at other non-Japanese restaurants here in the Valley.   We first arrived and we're greeted by a nice waitress. She took our drink orders and told us about the specials. ""Car-agee chicken"" ""What?!"" I'm not a Japanese language snob, but if you work in a Japanese restaurant that claims to sell Japanese food, at least learn the proper pronunciation of the dishes. It's ""kah-rha-ah-geh chicken""   Next came the food. My dad order the Tai special at the suggestion of the waitress. Should've known better judging by her knowledge of Japanese food. It was 4 small pieces of over-cooked fish for $23. What a rip!   My food was mediocre at best. The sushi rice was plain-- no rice wine vinegar as is customary for properly flavored sushi rice. Tempura was ok but the sauce did not come with shredded daikon.   For shame, Hana! You're giving Japanese food a bad name!",-1,-1
"Went last night and it was ridiculously bad. The waitress took our order but after about 25 minutes, the sushi hadn't come. Then she comes back and says there's a ""mixup"" at the sushi station and she RETAKES our sushi order, saying its ""getting plated"". It took another 20 minutes for the rolls to come out and they came out one by one. They were tasteless, probably because she had the chefs make them in a rush due to having forgotten our order entirely. No apology, no regard, nothing. I'm never going back there again.",-1,-1
"Bizarre. My family of 5 came here for lunch one day, to see what all the hype is about - and boy did Hana fall FLAT! I personally had no expectations and Hana still missed them.   Before seating us at a LARGE table (there's maybe 10 tables in this joint), this obviously inexperienced hostess first looked unsure of where she should seat us (the table for 2 or for 4?) She then proceeded to rearrange the table for 4, and moved ALL of the chairs around the table to add 1, instead of just adding it to the empty space on the end of the table.... odd.  And then our waitress.... was really abrupt and ungracious about things. My sister's accompanying salad was half covered in lettuce rust - and when she showed the waitress, all she said was ""so do you want it?"" Uhm, no thank you, I like my food fresh, not rotten, but thanks.  The sushi was pretty much the same thing covered in different sauces. Annnd they were pricey. it was kinda sorta really unbelievably ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, i tell you! Not worth it. No way. I'm quite sure that the ""crab"" was imitation. And the fish wasn't even that fresh. Granted, we're in the middle of a desert, but still.   The one redeeming quality of this place? The ramen. Although there were about 10 noodles in it, the pork was perfectly cooked. And it would have been nice if the chef had been a little less stingy with the ramen noodles.   Would I come back? Uhm.... only if I had no choice and was craving ramen. But for sushi? Save your money, go to Yen and get muuuuch better quality AND quantity.",-1,-1
"Hurry up and Leave!  This was our third visit to Hana because the food is excellent. God forbid you walk in at 8:40pm, 20 minutes until posted hours of closing time. Might as well post closing at 8:30pm as both service and quality decline closer to closing!!!  Fist two visits went extremely well and so why not try it a third, right?!?! NO! It was CLEAR by the hostesses reaction that we were not welcome at 840pm as she rolled her eyes and quickly walked away from us. Not a good first impression but we were confident in the food and decided to give it a go. We had a nice bottle of wine and were expecting a wonderful date night and the typical HANA experience... DENIED! We were in and out in less than 40 minutes, $75 for two of us (without tip), not including our bottle of wine we shared one glass of. We found ourselves shoveling food in our faces as the servers were doing all of their side work surrounding us. Very uncomfortable dining experience and disappointing.   I'm not one to post and especially not with a negative review and I WILL go back (before 8pm), but I do believe the owners and future guest should be aware of this situation. Last time I checked if your posted hours are until 9pm, you serve food until 9pm???? Right? Not everyone out by 9pm! Not to mention with your price point, guest are visiting your establishment to enjoy their dinning experience and not be rushed!   We ended up going to Sochu House for a couple other dishes as we did not get enough to eat and Lord knows my man needs his dessert. Hopefully, next visit will be earlier and better. Know that you have been warned, and enjoy Hana, but go early!!!!!",-1,-1
"Very disappointed with OUR overall portions & inflated price.  Our sashimi portions were thinly shaved slivers... They were almost as thin as the ginger slices - most of them ripped and transparent. The sashimi pics that others have posted on FB and here on Yelp, look large and generous.  That is not what we got!  Perhaps they were selfish with us because we weren't regulars.  Maybe they give bigger portions to other folks.  I don't know.   My husband and I were excited to go there late June 2013. It was our second time there in the course of 3 years.  The first time, we brought our 1 year old boy with us and we were treated ""carefully"" by the older woman.  She kept an eye on us as if she was worried our boy would throw food or be noisy.  He behaved well and we left satisfied.    I had recently been reading reviews and viewing pics on the super fresh sashimi. We were also excited to bring our own sake and beer. We had always forgotten in the past.  This time, we did not bring out boy.  We did bring our own booze but our bill was outrageous when we were all done even without alcohol.  We ordered lots of sashimi - six pieces each:  halibut -$12, Octopus at $10, striped bass at $10.  Also had a Vegas at $11.50, & Rainbow roll - I don't recall how much they charged for that one.  Anyway our bill was over $60 and they charged us $1.50 each for splitting the bill!  EACH of us.  That is cheap!  There were no sashimi combos offered on menu.  Must order each sashimi separately.    We are used to being lavished with giant chunks/slices of sashimi at Ah So on Bell.  We are regulars there.  Maybe that is why we get so much there.  Hana was not generous with fish at all especially the halibut. Paper-thin!  We will not be going back to Hana.   The ambience was fine.  Chefs were a little serious and gruff.  Servers seemed gruff too.  Rushed the bill.  Their price was just not worth what we got. The rolls and the portions of sashimi were just way too small.  We left hungry.  Not many sushi places in that area.  Cherry Blossom on 14th Street and Camelback is near.  They are more generous.",-1,-1
"Very cold environment.. looks like a takeout chinese place rather than a sushi restaurant... albacore was not fresh, portions are decent, overall quality is poor and I have have much better sushi for that $ here",-1,-1
"I absolutely LOVE this place. My husband and I went here on our first date and have never had a bad experience with regards to their service or food. Until tonight... We went for a Valentine's Day dinner  since my husband is a chef and will be working tomorrow and were delighted to try their Walu special. It was absolutely phenomenal, cooked perfectly and delicious. However.... Walu is also known as escolar had my husband known that it was escolar we would never have ordered the fish. We got home only to have extreme intestinal issues that are commonly associated with eating this fish (Google escolar). We called the restaurant to speak with a manager to let them know that their servers should say what the fish is... Escolar when letting patrons know the specials for the night and got a bit of attitude. Under normal circumstances I would give the maximum amount of stars but considering I am married to my toilet for the next few days one could say it's unethical to serve customers something that is known for giving people who eat it horrible stomach issues. Escolar is banned in Japan for crying out loud and I would have preferred to have made a conscious decision on whether I wanted to consume it.",-1,-1
"Well were to start?  It might be because I just had some of the best sushi on the plant at Tei Tei in Dallas but I wasn't impressed here in the slightest.    My highlights: -Oolong tea -Gari  Low lights: -Rice, it was almost like mochi, just a gooey mess. -Fish was VERY cold, it was almost like it was almost to the point of freezing and then served.  Thus leaving the fish with little to no taste. -Loads of scallions on everything, rolls and nigiri.  I assume to give it some flavor. -Nigiri all had loads of ponzu on it.  Once again to give it a flavor.    This place has numerous good reviews and I will tell all of you to look harder!  I had better Japanese in Scottsdale last year, I think it was at Kyoto.  UPDATE UPDATE- Best sushi in PHX is far and away Yasu.  Treat yourself and see what the real deal is like.  You will not be disappointed!",-1,-1
Mediocre at best. Rice used for sushi was good. Steamed dumplings were horrible. Noodles had almost no flavor. Service was sub-par. No need to come here again. I would recommend trying something else.,-1,-1
"Honestly, not good. The fish was fine in terms of quality but the knife cuts were sub par at best. I could be drunk and make better cuts. For those who know little about sushi I'm sure this is ""awesome bro"" but my experience with sushi is a lot more deep than most of the patrons here, I'm pretty sure..... the miso soup was fine. The rolls were fine. Actually nothing was great or even good. It got two stars because of the service, which was very good. My advice to the owners, lose the hipsters who think they are cool and get some sushi chefs who know how to correctly cut fish and serve it appropriately. Anyone who knows anything about sushi will understand this review.",-1,-1
"The sushi isn't terrible, but I really don't think it deserves 4 stars that everyone has put here. If you really like sushi and care about getting 6-8 pieces of sushi (as advertised) as opposed to 5, do not come here. I moved to Phoenix from California and have not tried many other sushi restaurants in the area, but I know I will not come back here. This was definitely an underwhelming and disappointing experience.",-1,-1
They don't accept takeout - doesn't work with postmates.,-1,-1
"Been here for a few years before. My mom still goes here to get a perm & cut, my sister comes to get her hair straightened.  Really liked the way how my sisters hair is done so I thought maybe I should give it a try. Called to book an appointment and explained the condition of my hair to the male staff. Knowing that I'm calling a week ahead for that specific day to get my hair done. He says you need to come in for us to see how your hair is on a weekday. I said I need to work on weekdays and the best day is on the weekend. So I've asked for that day and he said ""well, I don't want to book you in and then you not doing it. I don't want to ask a stylist to come in and then calling it off because it takes a third of a time"". VERY UPSET with this kind of service. Pretty much asking my family and friends not to go there anymore.",-1,-1
"I really wanted to like this place, because it's a mom-and-pop establishment and the owners seemed friendly. However, we did not have a good experience here. We ordered a grill cheese for the kids with a pasta salad for a side, and then my husband and I ordered a veggie panini and tried the won ton soup. The kids seemed to enjoy their grilled cheese (made with processed cheese - not what I'd anticipated), but my husband and I didn't think the soup was that good. There was also very little filling in our panini, but the food, albeit uninspired, was acceptable.  The kicker was that we had ordered two cartons of milk for our kids, one chocolate and one regular. The regular milk (with an expiry date two days in the future) had gone sour, and we unknowingly kept telling our toddler son to drink his milk even though he refused. We just figured he wasn't thirsty, until we brought home the untouched carton home and realized the contents had curdled. Even though it wasn't exactly the owner's fault that the milk had gone bad, based on our overall mediocre dining experience, we probably won't be back...sorry.",-1,-1
Sadly disappointed. Was really hoping to find a new spot in Medina. I hear that the quality of food is different than the Hudson location. I've ordered flatbread there 2x (gave it a second chance) but came up disappointed again. Does have s great little bar to stop by and grab a glass of wine,-1,-1
"Very overpriced and I would not recommend dining here.  It wasn't a completely horrible experience though... The server's beer recommendations were spot on, the stuffed peppers (though cold) were really flavorful and the highlight of the meal. The rest was well below average despite being priced quite high.  The majority of us chose to go with a few small plates a piece, and even though there were a couple of the same dishes...no 2 looked the same ( different portion sizes, one plate of scallops was seared on both sides the other on just one, different meat temps., etc.).  In general I can safely say the whole meal was poorly prepared by people who were very inexperienced. The one constant was everything was cold and had been sitting for a good bit.  Like I said before, the majority of the dinner was disappointing...but one thing stood out as offensively horrible...the crab cake. Hands down the worst crab cake I've ever had in my life. Bone dry, completely flavorless, and on top of a bed of rubbery frozen corn. If you make the mistake of dining here....save yourself $16 and avoid this disgusting plate...stick with the other overpriced dishes. At least then you'll be just disappointed and not angry.",-1,-1
My husband and I have been to this restaurant 3 times. Each time the service was bad and the drinks weren't mixed right. The last time was the most disappointing. The servers were more interested in flirting with eachother and drinking than in taking care of customers. I ordered a tomato saled and the tomatoes were mealy. The manager took it off our bill but didn't stop to apologize (the place wasn't busy). So sad because I was really excited about a new restaurant on the square.,-1,-1
"We attended on a Friday night, and it was quite busy. That said, our waitress was pretty chilly and inattentive. The food is American fare: much of which you can find in other local restaurants, done better. When a restaurant states they are a gastropub, I would expect to see more exotic proteins than chicken, beef and lobster - especially at the prices they wanted. Generally, the experience was fine, but I probably won't take guests there, or go back myself.",-1,-1
"This review is for our most recent visit on 12/22.  We have eaten here a couple times before and always enjoyed the food and service.  This past visit will be our last.  Based on past experience I suggested Lager & Vine to my family.  All 12 were seated by 5:45 and the place was at most 50% full.  We ordered 3 appetizers and 2 salads between 12 people.  At 7:00 our dinners were served.  45 minutes after placing our dinner order.  3 of the first 4 dishes served were barely luke warm to cool.  Poor food on top of a long wait only compounds the problem.  Went face to face with owner who insisted it was 25 minutes from order in to order out but he could not explain the multiple cool dishes - which wouldn't have happened if the food had actually been turned around in 25 minutes.  He never did apologize to my party for the wait or poor food.  Arrogant owners who can't believe they did any wrong are the restaurants worst ambassador.  He may think his s**t doesn't stink, but on this night his food did.",-1,-1
"Dinner for two took 1 hour and 45 minutes on Saturday at 5.    Inexperienced wait staff,  filet that's mostly grizzle, butchered ahi tuna and missing sides.    Great location but no parking.    Will wait a year to try it again having had two weak experiences since the opening date!",-1,-1
"Second & last time at this establishment. There were four of us , the drinks order were taken & presented in a timely fashion. The salads & soup took 20 minutes to arrive , excuse me but 20 minutes for a bowl of soup & basically a green salad . From that point another 20 minutes for tacos. The place is overpriced for the quality of food served , if you get it in a  timely manner while it is still warm.",-1,-1
"Not impressed. The interior is dated, the food is amateur-ish and overpriced. Not much flavor. Service was good though. Will not be back.",-1,-1
I had been scoping this place out for months before I tried it.  I always see it when I go to Sprouts but I'm always over there before they open.  When I finally made my way over there in the afternoon I got a gyro and fries.  I took it home had maybe 3-4 bites and fed the rest to my dog.  It was so greasy that I had oil dripping down my face.  It was flavorless which I thought was impossible for gyro meat.  The tzatziki was flavorless as well and really watered down.  The fries were OK.  I've eaten a lot of gyro's in my life and this one was not good.  The gyro place on Northsight is only about 5 minutes away from here and 100 times better.,-1,-1
"I went in today and asked the owner if he could not cut the meat so thin and cut it a little thick and he said No, this is how I cut it. I respect that but I will not be returning, he also missed out on a large 237 people catering event for my office.",-1,-1
"Website indicates they are open on Sundays.  Yet when I went out of my way to try this place on a Sunday - guess what?  Yep, closed.  And there were other people who showed up to eat as well while I loitered outside, trying to find an alternative place for falafel on a Sunday.  To make matters worse I have politely notified them of this on a subsequent visit and clearly expressed how inconvenient it was.  And here I am now, writing this review weeks later... and the website has not changed.   Fail.",-1,-1
My girlfriend just had her nails done in the same center.  We walked by and ordered a few Gyros to-go.  Got home and we both took our first bites and looked at eachother with the same thought.  These were awful.    Now I know why they were not busy at all.,-1,-1
"Ordered the ""grilled veggies "" plate to be helathy...an give them a chance over pita jungles version . These were frozen then thawed overcooked greasy soggy veggies. Not ever going back.",-1,-1
"The food was excellent! HOWEVER...the Service was nonexistant! We arrived at 6:40PM 1/19/2013, we were told they didn't have our reservation for 6. They were able to seat us within 5 minutes on the heated patio. We were handed menus and then the Waiter dissappeared. Later on another waiter came and introduced himself as Mike and he would be taking good care of us. He took our drink order and we never saw him again. Later on the original Waiter came and said he'd help us out. He brought us our drinks and asked if we wanted bread. They gave us all a warm roll and dissappeared again. We had no butter or dipping oil for the bread. One os our friends got up and fetched oild and vinegar from the waiter station. Later on the original waiter came back to take our order. When I said that I believe we were abandoned, he said that they were busier than usual and that I hurt his feelings. He took another drink  order but didn't return with them. Another 3rd waiter came back with our drinks about 20 minutes later. Our food was great but then it took another 30 minutes to get our bill. It took them 2 hours and 20 minutes to serve us from start to finish. The whole time, I watched to see how busy they really were and the poor service was due to disorganization. Not one women works there and I think that's a big part of their problem. Women would have been organized and efficient. These guys were all nice but not very on the ball and generally overwhelmed. I don't think it had to do with being busy (there were empty tables the whole time), just laziness and/or an inability to be organized and efficient. We won't go back again.",-1,-1
"Had reservations for 6 PM, got there at 5:50 PM and we're seated right away. Table was already. My daughter wasn't feeling well so we ordered soup it took them 45 minutes before they even realized she was never given the soup, I had to ask for it. We didn't get out of there until a quarter after eight we had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for our food. A party of eight came in after us and left 25 minutes before us. Not too happy with them. Not like they used to be.",-1,-1
"I decided to try the penne vodka. Since everybody's comment seemed positive about it.  I live 2 min form this restaurant so I got it delivered to my house.  Well, how to say it? It has to be the worse pasta I've ever had. So much cream I couldn't even find the pasta in the plate, there is no flavor whatsoever. I felt like the opened a can of tomato sauce, added some cream and pepper to eat and bye bye.  Seriously guys.!!  Same for the bread, It was plain and not so good.  I know some of you might think that because it got delivered, this is the reason why it was bad. But no, everything was very hot when it got here.  The only good thing was the can of coke!",-1,-1
"I'll start with the positive. Service, ambiance and bread were good. However, if you put pasta in your restaurants name, don't serve it over cooked. Ruins the meal. The Penne vodka sauce was good with over cooked, I imagine precooked and reheated pasta. I added chicken; that should have been grilled and seasoned, but was no doubt boiled with no flavor whatsoever. I did not even eat it for the extra 3 bucks.  If you bring bread to the table, bring butter, but not butter that is so hard you can't even get it on the bread. Pasta Brioni is saved by the ambiance.",-1,-1
"Unfortunately, the food was less then mediocre at best.  We both ordered their cheese ravioli and after the first bite we both determined that it had been cooked in the same water that had had some type of seadfood cooked in it.  The taste of shellfish was very evident.  Also, their bruschetta was not good at all. I would not recommend the restaurant.",-1,-1
Pasta was gummy..french bread is heavy.. nor do I say more,-1,-1
"A few friends and I had a reservation at 7:30 last Saturday at Pasta Brioni. The restaurant was busy - it seems like a popular spot for snowbirds.    Even though we had a reservation, we weren't sat at a table until 7:45. At this point, we realized how disorganized the staff was - we had random mis-matched silverwear (at a table with four of us, it took them 10 minutes and 3 tries to get an almost complete set of silverwear - meaning a fork, a knife, a spoon and a side plate - for everyone at the table.) We also didn't get a menu for almost 15 minutes.   Definitely some issues with the service. Although we sat at 7:45, our server didn't take our order until 8:15. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer salads to arrive, around 8:35. After we finished our salads, it was another 30 minutes before we had our main courses - they didn't arrive until after 9:10. At this point we were starving, the server tried to make light of the situation - apologizing for the delay and joking that he bet we had time to work up an appetite.   The food was very mediocre - not terrible, but nothing special. In my opinion, definitely not worth the hour wait. They also didn't get all of our orders right - my friend had ordered a pasta dish with chicken, only to have it come out without chicken. Another friend was very disappointed with her meal and barely touched it, she didn't complain but I was surprised they didn't offer to bring her something else or take it off the bill.   We were all laughing about what a disappointing 2-hour experience it was from start to finish - we won't be back!",-1,-1
"I have never written a Yelp review before.  But, after a recent trip to Pasta Brioni, I found myself inspired to write my first.  This has nothing to do with the pasta, which was mediocre at best.  This has to do with the absolutely abysmal service we recieved.  We were completely ingored for the majority of our meal.  At one point I had to go to the bar and ask our server, who was engaged in a lengthy conversation with a female patron, for a Coke refill.  When he came do the table he slammed our drinks down and left without a word.  Clearly, he was to busy flirting to be bothered with work at work.  I can safely say that I will not be returning to this place.  I prefer my pasta without the uppity Scottsdale attitude.",-1,-1
"So disappointing. Haven't gone in few years and decided to try. Wedge had wilted lettuce, tasteless tomato and the blue cheese had zero flavor. Then the  veal Chop. Served with frozen spinach, tasteless mushrooms drenched in butter and the chop itself was bland and blah. The ciopini was blah. Overall not good at all. Too bad, used to be great. what came first, no business or crap ingredients and no chef? Surprised it's still in business.",-1,-1
"Never again.   We made reservations for 5:45 on a Saturday night, definitely did not need a reservation though, the place was dead. We were told to sit wherever we wanted, we chose a booth in the lounge. The decor was nice, pretty typical for a small Italian restaurant.  The service was awkward but I think the server was new, he didn't mess anything up, he just did odd things. Like he took our order and had to come back again because he forgot what my boyfriend had ordered. After our meals were delivered (by someone else) our server came by and said ""once your pasta arrives, do you want cheese? OH! It's already here! I'm blind!"". We chose to laugh about the slightly bizarre service, we have both been the new kid before too.   I liked the rolls that came before dinner but the oil/vinegar bottles were both leaky so made a mess of our hands and the table.  I had the balsamic chicken, I really liked that this restaurant offers an under 650 calorie menu, as I wasn't starving and not really in the mood for pasta it was a good choice. I thought it had a good flavor and I enjoyed what I ate of it, I wasn't super hungry and had already had a lot of bread.   My boyfriend had pesto chicken pasta, I noticed him doing something strange during the meal,  he kept taking a bite of his meal and then pulling pieces of chicken out of his mouth and putting it on the bread plate. I asked him what was wrong and he said ""I don't know, it's like cartilage or something, it's just...not good"". He did finish the dish though (except for the ever growing pile of chewed chicken on the bread plate).   We left and agreed that we wouldn't be back.  Unfortunately, the reason for this place doesn't even deserve the 1-star, midnight found us both on the bathroom floor. Him, projectile vomiting from a textbook case of food poisoning and me playing nurse. Great way to end our Saturday date night.",-1,-1
"Went on a recommendation of my nail technician, but I thought it was going to be better but that's probably my fault for setting the expectation. I found toasted ravioli after so long and it was pre-doused in marinara, bah. I wanted a dish that was on the dinner menu, but was told ""the kitchen is too busy tonight, can't do that"" so that was a bummer. The penne al vodka was okay, thus the 2 stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to order from there again.",-1,-1
horible sauce.......doubtful if fresh tomatoes used or even canned marzanos  the sauce was a tomato paste and water  and reminded me of what poor immigants ate when they arrived off the boat at ellis island..  decor predictable and keeps in line with other bronx-like establishments..oversized portions but who cares  food is terrible  would not return to casa brioni (marinara manor),-1,-1
Pasta Brioni in a nut shell: Hot waiters. Mediocre food.,-1,-1
"I am sorry to give one star, but after the second attempt I can definitely say that the food is VERY DISAPPOINTING!  I tried the chef salad and the quality was just low. Usually I am an indiscriminate eater, but this salad was just disgusting.  Second time I ordered the rigatoni four cheese and a Caesar salad... The pasta doesn't even taste pasta. I am from Italy, and in my opinion, pasta must to be cooked in certain ways. The rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good. The Caesar salad wasn't that bad, but neither special. I am disappointed because a friend of mine recommended this place for pasta, but I didn't like it. I am sorry but I won't come back.",-1,-1
"Nasty calzonetti, undercooked dough and icky burn marks on the dough made for a terrible meal.",-1,-1
"Second visit to Scottsdale -- second visit to Pasta Brioni.   First time was great.  This time -- ""eh"".   Ordered the mussels in a tomato broth (this was very good).   Husband said his chicken parm was just okay; friend's spaghetti and meatballs same thing -- just okay.  My salmon was a bit on the fishy side and I was uber thirsty the entire night.   Actually had to get up out of bed for water during the night.   Seemed pricey for what we got ($40/per person) - with 1 drink each.   Probably won't go back.   Have since heard that ownership has changed and really -- it wasn't worth the drive from Surprise.   Sorry.",-1,-1
"The red sauce has no flavor.  The chicken martini was soggy....not crispy, I specifically asked for crispy.  It was a soggy mess.  I also requested light sauce.  Again. Soggy.   The butter served with the bread was sweet.... ?   The worse part was the loud private conversation of the wait staff and the bartender. They stood right behind us and were extremely loud, laughing shouting.....Really horrible.    The dust on the blinds (that we were right next too) was an inch thick. Needless to say, not good. I would not even call it Italian food. ..I have been to Italy and this food is more Long Island 1960's chef boyardee then anything I ever ate in Italy.  Even the beet salad was terrible.  How do mess that up, try Terrible dressing, bitter lettuce.  Some sort of beet that tasted sour and old.  We will not be back. Again I wonder where the owner is and if he eats there.",-1,-1
"I really wanted to like this joint, I havent enjoyed pasta for a few months and was really looking forward to consuming food here. Let me tell you, for as long as it was to actually receive and consume the food.... it was worth it. The food was phenomenal, that was about it. Unfortunately it was incredibly busy due to the marathon, as well as the auctions. Meal tickets were getting lost, it was mass MASS chaos. Our waiter seemed aloof, and then after a while he started getting it together. One thing I really didn't appreciate was the fact that when we got there they sat us by the door to the outside patio (which at the time was closed). After a while someone propped the door open and it was extremely cold. I asked the host (some guy with little man syndrome) if they could close the door, he annoyingly said ""Nope, can't do it we have people outside."" Before I could even respond, he took his little elf self and ran away. We also had our son along, this place is not so good for kids.",-1,-1
"Where to start, let's just saw Awful!!!!!  Service was ok, waiter was pleasant.  Ordered the angel hair with chicken, it showed up almost 10 minutes after every one else was served, and when it did, the pasta was almost RAW... How do you screw up angel pasta, well they did.  Another in our party had the eggplant parm.  They should call it no eggplant pram...barely any eggplant...overall, ever rated, over priced, and just not very good....",-1,-1
"So all this hype on hot waiters had this place on my list to do on my Stay-cation.   Sad to say, I was majorly disappointed!  A group of gals hit this place for a late lunch on a Friday. The server acted like he was bothered from the get-go. The service was slow and he was rude and cold.  The food was pretty good. I had meatballs and capellini. The sauce was one of the best I have had. My friends enjoyed pizza and a meatball sandwich.  I would possibly return for the good food. The service left something to be desired, especially a hot hospitable Italian man.",-1,-1
Been here many times over........ Where are the beautiful waiters go? service is ok but I was told they all went to Un Baccio....food is still ok but service with beautiful waiters made this place awsome....:(,-1,-1
"We were in Scottsdale for training and had met the owner Brian the previous evening. He implored us to come see him for lunch the following day, ""we were going to love it"". What a mistake. The food was slightly better than Olive Garden. We walked in and there was nobody to greet us, we wandered past the kitchen and asked the cook if they were open. Our server was working the place by himself, it took FOREVER for any service. There was one other table in the place beside us, and it was slooooooooooooow.Well over an hour for lunch, with four people in our party, and one other couple in the restaurant. No lunch prices, just a dinner menu, I spent 27 dollars plus tip for a bowl of pasta and a glass of iced tea. (great rolls though.) The owner never bothered to come out and say hello, or thank us for coming to his restaurant. How they have stayed in business as long as they have is beyond me.",-1,-1
"This was our first visit to Pasta Brioni based on high marks from several friends. The atmosphere and service were fine but the food was disappointing. Our shrimp risotto was more like shrimp and wild rice and the linguini pesto chicken needed salt to bring out the flavor and I never salt my food. Disappointing food in both our meals. Maybe other dishes are better but it will be a long time before we go again to find out. Save your money, there are several better choices within walking distance.",-1,-1
"Most ridiculous happy hour ever! This restaurant has a bar side & a dining room side.  There are stools at the bar & some booths on bar side.  We arrived for happy hour & all stools were taken so we sat in a booth in the bar. Waiter told us that the happy hour prices were only good AT the bar.  We said But we are IN the bar!  He said sorry.  33% HIGHER price for drinks AND food  3 feet from the bar.  IDIOTIC!  We went to Roaring Fork, nicer place, pub tables, lower prices for drinks & food at their happy hour.  They lost us as customers & we live in the neighborhood!",-1,-1
"We were visiting the Phoenix area from Indianapolis wanted to find a great Italian restaurant for my Mother in law's birthday.  We chose Pasta Brioni  based on the Yelp reviews.  I have to say that our party of six had one of the worst dinning experiences of our lives.  The location is incredibly difficult to find but after driving around it for 20 minutes we found it.  We had made a reservation and were seated immediately, which I thought was great considering they were pretty full.   This is where the service stopped.  We were sat without menus for 10 minutes.  Once we had menus we waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to return and give us their specials.  Each time the waiter came to our table he would say a few words and then immediately turn and quickly leave, not asking if we had any questions or God forbid if we would like a drink.  A member of our party asked the man helping and serving bread and water about a menu item.  He refused to answer only stating that he would get the waiter.  After reading the menu for 15 minutes our waiter returned to take our order.  He took our food order and turned and left.  I had to snap my fingers to get his attention when he was about 10 feet away from our table to get him to come back and finally take our drink order.    Once we had our drinks we toasted to the birthday girl during which I spilled my drink.  I quickly got up and located my waiter notified him of what had happened.  He looked like a deer in headlights and asked me what we should do.  I asked for something to clean it with and was handed a few extra napkins.    Back at the table, drink cleaned up and waiting again this time 30 minutes for our dinner.  The manager? or host?  apologized and stated our meals would be out shortly.  Once the meals arrived the food was good, not the best Italian I have ever had but by no means the worst either.  Definitely not worth the time that it took to receive it.  My rating is based solely on the terrible service we received and that we had to try and chase down our waiter to get anything done.",-1,-1
"Booked a double room ahead of time. Checked in and was told all they had were single, king bedrooms. Didn't work as there were 3 of us. Manager said it wasn't his problem as I booked through a 3rd party site. Told him I called the hotel directly to tell them of my request and he didn't get it.  Then asked for a cot or rollaway, which was told they didn't have any. Ended up sleeping on the floor. Had to call down to get pillows and blankets. Not offered them by the ""manager"". I used quotes as he was a pitiful excuse for one.  Noticed there was a maintenance worker on my floor with 2 open doors. Looked inside to see unfinished, double rooms. Guess that was one of my rooms, which they didn't have ready.   Woke up at 4pm to idiots screaming in the alley. Since I didn't want to pay $20 per day to park, I found a spot on the street. Had to continuously check to make sure my car wasn't broken into or stolen. With broken liquor bottles in the gutter and shady characters loitering,  not the greatest area. I wouldn't recommend the hotel for single, female business travelers.   As I was checking out at 6am, I was offered coffee. Waited 5 minutes only for the front desk clerk to tell me they didn't have any.  For $250 a night, I expected a lot more. Probably not worth half that. Very disappointing.",-1,-1
"WARNING - A Nice Hotel Stay Ruined By An Obnoxious Price Gouge - WARNING  This is a converted Holiday Inn, made all sleek and modern.  The public areas were very nice and either new or well maintained.  The lobby was so modern, it seemed somewhat lacking in utility - and chairs - and there was an overpowering air freshener scent that hit you in the face when you walked in the front door.  The rooms were very modern.  The bathrooms were huge, with granite floors, which were slippery,  and huge (6' X 8') glass showers.  That was cool but, with one rain showerhead, most of it was completely wasted space.  The rest of the room suffered in size for the enormous bathroom.  In a room with two queen beds, there were only two chairs, and no table.  There were only a couple of drawers in the long modern dresser/desk thing down one wall.  There were only two plugs behind the nightstand, with a clock radio and phone already plugged in, so you couldn't charge phones next to the bed.  I forgot my power strip.  The floors were wood/laminate.  Altogether, the room tried to be modern and sacrificed function and comfort to do so.  Everything was very clean.  We did not have time to try most of the amenities or the bar and restaurant.  I got the impression that the place was pretty empty.  The reason for the terrible review, rather than good though is that there is no self-parking!  They have a lot, but it is valet parking only at a cost of $24.00 per day ($35.00 for large vehicles).  This is not in the city center.  They could simply charge a reasonable amount for parking. This is simply a way to have a lower price in online reservations systems and still squeeze a whole lot of money out of unsuspecting guests.  No sir, if you mislead guests on their true costs, you get one star!",-1,-1
"This review would have been 5 stars because the room was stylish, spacious, clean, and comfortable.  The bathroom featured a huge spa-like luxurious shower.  The staff was approachable, helpful,  and knowledgeable about the neighborhood.  Room service was prompt and the food delicious.  However, the reason we needed to use room service was that the private party in the restaurant/bar area was playing such loud music and partying.  It was impossible to even have a conversation in the public areas of the hotel since it felt like being in a nightclub!",-1,-1
"Looks are deceiving, everything is cheaply made.  No refrigerator. Hair on the shower floor (gross)! The valet workers all seem tired and not too helpful. Pro was that it was a specious room and good location.  Rather pay a little more for Ace hotel down the block.",-1,-1
"If I could give this zero stars I would. We were staying here for our wedding reception. The first moment I tried to check in and was told they couldn't find our reservation. We were told to just ""stay at home since we lived in the area"". I was then told to just sit down so he could take care of other people and was ignored for 20 minutes. Eventually, we got a room by paying double even though we had a whole wedding party staying there and booked something over 6 months ago.   Next, the bar. We stopped by after our reception (in our wedding attire), and were ignored for about 20 minutes before being told that they can't make what we wanted or much else, again with a sarcastic and rude attitude.   Lastly, as we were trying to just get out of this place, we called down to see if we could get a valet to help with our bags. I was told to just get it myself and received no help. Happy to be leaving.   Overall, this is the WORST customer service I have ever encountered.

"I recently went SST with my family. The entertainment was great and the atmosphere was great, but the (volunteer) workers were not. Some of them were absolutely rude. As we were parking (for one of the shows) we witnessed an interaction between a person with disabilities and a volunteer worker. The volunteer worker was screaming at the person with disabilities. It was degrading and so unnecessary. It scared my kid. I felt bad for the person with disabilities. As a result of this experience my kids and I no longer want to go. I think next season I will  support something else.",-1,-1
"I went to the first performance of the ""Super Summer Theater"", it was supposed to be a show featuring a variety of different songs from Broadway Musicals. However, they completely changed the rhythm and the tone of the songs to the point that they were no longer even recognizable, ruining classics like the King & I, Oklahoma, The Sound of Music, etc. It was so bad that by the time it was over the majority of people had already left. Keep your money I want the 90 minutes of my life that you stole back!!!",-1,-1
"Richard P from Northwood is now messaging me trying to convince me of the benefits of their 'tab' system.  See my previous review, it does not work. He says its hard to do separate bills and a lot of work for servers and customers (huh?!)...so they don't want to do it. I wonder how all those other restaurants do it? Magic? Actually when you do split bills its so nice and easy for the customer and we love it!! For now I'll continue to avoid this place at all costs.  Richard P's private messages to me explicitly told me that they do NOT do separate bills. They do allow you to try and calculate what you owe on the one bill that you receive, but that is NOT a separate bill. He also"" justified"" to me in previous messages why northwood doesn't do separate bills,  so I'm not sure what his comment to my review even means. Regardless, I will never return after the rude service I received. As the server at the last restaurant I went to told me ""of course I can do separate bills for you, and any place that says they can't is lying or has severely outdated equipment""   If anyone wants clarification on what was sent to me, feel free to pm me! :)",-1,-1
"I am far too old and grumpy to put up with wobbly chairs and tables, overpriced cocktails and a ridiculous menu. The staff seemed to hate their jobs while we were there. I get it. I have hated serving tables too.  I really think that this place is best for a burgeoning young relationship where you aren't eating anyway and are trying to impress your date with how sophisticated you are.",-1,-1
"Took a half hour to be told that the ""snack"" I ordered was no longer available. Took another 15 minutes to be given something that looked like dog food and had a chefs hair in it! Yuck!",-1,-1
"Overall not worth it. I did enjoy the environment and set-up but menu was disappointing. For an appetizer I did order hummus and what I got in return was a few dozen seasoned garbanzo beans. And the chai latte was bland, it couldn't even wash out the bad taste in my mouth.",-1,-1
I came twice here and both times was turned away because they were at capacity.   The first time I left my number and was texted back 1.5 hours later. It seems unbelievable that the next available seat needed a 1.5 hour wait.   The second time there was clearly a woman at the bar leaving and an empty stool next to her but I still received the same response. I told the host not to bother taking my number.  Maybe I don't fit the clientele or the host didn't want to bother serving me... the drinks were good in the past but I couldn't care for the host.,-1,-1
"Super hipster crowd here. Gotta love the exposed brick and wooden seating. Drink deals Are not the greatest but alright. I like the variety of light fixtures and cozy setup . Not much for appetizer situation. They cannot split bills, only offer cash machine that'll charge you.",-1,-1
"Expensive, small portions.  Way over priced!  Obviously too much labor to pay for this little restaurant!  The number of servers and cooks on the line were nearing the number of patrons.  The food was ok, but nothing spectacular.  They need a consultant to help them with their labor distribution and realign their menu prices with their portion size.",-1,-1
"The stars are for service only as the manager and owner was extremely accommodating and did not charge us for the food we could not eat..   So that's the good part but you must be wondering Hope why would you go to a restaurant to not eat food?! Crazy I know, but the food was just that awful we could not force it down ! I ordered a few rolls and asked for cream cheese to be added because I like the creamy taste mixed with flavorful fish .. Keyword is flavorful . This tasted like eating a stick of cream cheese wrapped in rice, nothing else had Any flavor !!   When I explained to the manager she tried to say well you added cream cheese and now you're complaining it tastes like cream cheese , fair point if there was nothing else in the roll, however a tiny amount of it should not completely over power everything else, don't blame the poor cream cheese dude, blame your lousy quality tasteless fish! We tried sashimi too and it literally had no taste on its own.   The pork Gyoza was the only thing that tasted normal .. Speaking of which we asked for spicy mayo and if you have had sushi anywhere you know it's pretty thin and spicy. This was just regular thick globby mayo with probably food coloring as it was not spicy at all!   Also their drinks were Flat and when I pointed it out I was told that's not possible it was just changed today !   Seriously you guys with broken taste buds stop leading us astray! Sushi station which is a revolving sushi bar tastes like 20x better than here, we went there after we left here since we only had a few bites each and were still hungry !",-1,-1
"My wife loves Sushi, we live close this this place. We have been 3 separate times and the service has always and consistently been awful. The servers will forget about you, and the older Asian woman working there will ignore you.  Stay Away.",-1,-1
Worse sushi ever. It was not constructed well and the customer service was awful. We waited 20 minutes to get seated and the restaurant and the place was empty! The food came out before they even brought out the water. Would never recommend this place to anyone.,-1,-1
"First time here.  Remember BYOB.  I know Sakana and consider them the gold standard.  In comparison I'd say the food was OK but some of the portions, for the money, were skimpy. Especially for the price paid.  I'd go back to Sakana before going back to Hana.",-1,-1
"Hana has been one of the restaurants in our bucket list. My husband and I had the opportunity to go here. I really wanted to like this place but just bummed and came home unhappy and unsatisfied.  We ordered gyoza, ginger pork lunch bento, salmon terriyaki lunch bento and a volcano sushi. Total bill was about $39 and some change.  The gyoza was actually pretty good. I wish we could have gotten 2 orders and be done with it. I had the ginger pork, I pretty much had about 8 thinly sliced bite size pork hidden within some onions and ginger. My husband had a really small salmon. The side dishes were boiled potato, okra, squash and something else - I am not sure what it is.   Underwhelmed and still a bit hungry, we ordered the volcano. I'm a little disappointed as it wasn't what I am used to. The only fish I found was the fish on the very top, that's it.  Overall, it was an underwhelming and unsatisfying lunch. I wish we have gone somewhere else. Not going back and can't recommend it.",-1,-1
"Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).    One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.    I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!",-1,-1
Their seating policy is ridiculous.  2 people can only sit at a 2 person table.  Recently had 3-4 groups of 2 waiting with multiple empty tables that seat 4.  Never heard of a restaurant that is willing to loose business for an absurd policy like this.... And the staff is rude about too.,-1,-1
"Very friendly staff!, but this review only applies to the food, since we got  it to go.  Pretty boring order consisting of a california roll, a spicy tuna roll, and a squid salad ( so it should have been hard to screw up, right?).  The California roll, was just crab and cucumber....no avocado, which was really odd to me. It wasn't bad, just missing avocado. Rice is a good consistency. The spicy tuna was rancid....gross, plus I paid $8.00 for something I couldn't eat. And then the squid salad tasted off....and this is something I eat for lunch at least twice a week from this little japanese market, so I know my squid salad.  We ended up throwing everything out. It's obvious our first time will be our last.",-1,-1
"Disappointed...  I had heard wonderful things about Hana and I was excited to try a sushi place near downtown Phoenix. Maybe my hopes were too high, but the sushi was just okay. I'd rather drive far away for good sushi than stay close to home for mediocre sushi.",-1,-1
For the whole story of my experience here refer to Aletheia's post (my sis).  I wanted to put my two cents in that it was extremely over priced and the katsu was really really dry. As an example it was dryer than when i wake up after sleeping with my mouth open in Phoenix.  Definitly sat in awkward silence for awhile though... :\  good thing we had a gift card to this place...cause i would be upset if i had to pay that much for this place and recieved poor quality food like that... Definitly not going back again...unless it is free.,-1,-1
"Meh, about says it. It was OK, the volcano roll was pretty good. The service was good but I just wans't all that impressed.",-1,-1
"One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first.    I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made.  Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.    Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered: Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had) Spicy scallop nigiri (good) Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces) Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch) Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?)  The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.  It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave.   Lackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price.  No thanks.",-1,-1
"Exactly! Meh. I've experienced better.  Maybe my expectation was too high after checking all good reviews and reputation of this place on yelp and some magazines.   Foods; Pretty much every slice of sashimi was stringy even though it's called toro and very uneven surface - for Salmon, Halibut, and Tuna? maybe dull sashimi knife?!  Yellowtail taste good but the sushi looking was not that appetizing Oysters were way too big and over priced  Service was decent and attentive.. nothing super attractive or fascinating..  I'm not really motivated to drive back to this place anymore, so my final verdict of this place is ""Meh""",-1,-1
"What the heck am I missing here?  The rice again was ooey and gooey again on my last visit, sticking to the roof of my mouth and having a waxy feel about it  .... I guess some people like it that way?   I was hoping that it was just a fluke the first time but now also the second time.  Other people's review I trust give it more stars.  I just don't get it.",-1,-1
"Used to love this place, and still think very highly of the food, but the recent emergence of awful attitudes from the owners and staff has put them in the back seat. Make no mistake, it is the best sushi in town, and Koji-San is the best chef, but everything else about it stinks. The wait staff is surly, and nobody could care less if you were actually in the restaurant. It is a BYOB, which I kind of like, but only if I can stop by AJ's and get a nice bottle of Sake or Shochu before hand. I recommend the ahi as it is always super fresh, and the mackerel is served in an extremely unique fashion. Nothing like looking something in the eye while you eat it.",-1,-1
"Found this place on the fly while out running errands and starving.  Owners were nice, especially Husband..Very courteous.  Place was clean and we were offered water or a drink while waiting for our takeout. Food was very, very bland...very little flavor at all...  Kung Pow had what I considered too many bell peppers and wasn't spicy (hot) even after I asked if it would be spicy enough.   Cheese puffs bland.   Eggrolls Bland.  Portion sizes were Ok but sauces were much more runny than other places...and did I mention bland?  our search continues....",-1,-1
First off let me say that I should of TRUSTED past reviews. A few different negatives.  Leasing agent was polite and not pushy but did not inform of many vital things that pertain to living at Loft 5 and the move in / approval process.  HOA rules and regulations were not fully listed and detailed until after lease was signed. Move in due to these rules did not go smoothly at all resulting in 2 attempts at furniture delivery.   Appliances are great when they work but they often do NOT! I have been greatly disappointed by the kitchen.    Total service calls in a month  1x for stove  1x microwave  1x washer / dryer  3x dishwasher  The cabinet trim is poorly constructed and often falls off!  Elevators are slow and doors are outdated keyed design which makes entering building more tiring than need be.  Garage floor is squeaky as cars drive over there is a harsh and loud screech which can be heard from my 5th floor unit  Pool is kept semi clean but is very shallow and is only good to splash around in when  in direct sun.   BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that every rule is slighted to make the HOA money NOT actually correct an issue. Many people have dogs and there is often barking and noise disturbances.   Take your money elsewhere and spend less!,-1,-1
"This is a tough review to write.  I absolutely love the apartment itself- the size, the openness, the amenities. The common areas are great (pools specifically) and some neighbors are friendly.  What I don't like, and the reason for so few stars are the following:  - Multiple car police activity outside or inside the complex at least once a month and gun shots coming from somewhere in the neighborhood occasionally  - The HOA for Loft 5 is horrendous. As someone who leases, it feels like the HOA is trying to make renters get tired of jumping through hoops and move out. They seem to have become much worse in the past few months. I've actually considered moving and have told friends who want to move here to hold off.",-1,-1
"Brief yet terrible experience...I considered moving here because I know someone that lives there and has been advocating for them for months.  I'll keep it simple, if you're going to live here...stay away from pattie. Although I am grateful for her incompetence(since I love where I live now) I just want to save you the stress. I heard great things about Karen, who I unfortunately didn't get to work with but let's just say it's been over a month since I applied and I had to do the following up. First she claimed she didn't update me because I was out of town for work, then when I responded to her email asking what the next step was she ignored me from there on our..however I responded to an ad an hour later and she emailed RIGHT back(she didn't know it was me of course)   Considering the fact that I had a similar experience upon move in at my last place of residence I knew that was a red flag so I gladly took my business elsewhere. I knew she was in the wrong industry from the first day I toured Loft 5 but I wanted to give her a fair chance because the property was the closest to what I had at that time but I am glad I followed my instincts.",-1,-1
"I lived in this place for 10 months.. The noise between the units is unbearable. I wrote emails, daily phone calls over the course of a month. I was unable to sleep in my own bed. There was nothing done to assist me so I had not choice but to move out!! So upon my move out I was told the my deposits (which were $1350 plus $500 in pet) we would just make it a wash. When I called them over a month ago and made sure I had a zero balance I was told yes I do! I just now got off the phone with a debt collection company whom is telling me I owe $635 (if that's true then they owe me change). I left my place spotless, had a very good walk throu, those office people are horrible and don't know what's what and don't take care of the renters! The place looks nice and that is it!!!!!!!! Also when I lived there cops were called to the property almost daily. I have been told numerous times that pimps and prostitutes live there. I would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE!!",-1,-1
"I am a former resident of Loft 5 going through a law suit with them currently. I was living there for over 6 months and in that time my car was vandalized, packages stolen from the mail room, items stolen from my car, pot smoking/drug dealing neighbor and so much more!   ***Do any of the former residents or current residence have the management office email address? I   If you are looking to rent here its a beautiful community but be prepared to be highly; dissatisfied with customer service. Its pretty much as if there is no management, they completely ignore their tenants!",-1,-1
"Was looking for a nice place to move so I completed the online form to setup an appointment to see an apartment. No call back so I called and left a message, still no response and that was two weeks ago. I really wanted to check out loft 5 but you need an appointment but no one calls back and I'm not going to keep calling when I am the customer. I found the Lofts at 7100 and will be moving there. I heard loft 5 was nice, but oh well. One star for the lack of follow up which equals poor customer service.  Can't comment on the property.",-1,-1
"Buyers beware! I have been living here a little over a year and question every day why I moved  here. There's not a month that goes by that I'm not calling the maintenance. Clogged drains, dirty vents, and and there is absolutely no installation in these unit.  It seriously sounds like I live above Motor Speedway! There is constant barking stomping and and the neighbors music is so loud you feel like you're at the newest nightclub in Las Vegas.  Loft 5 is only good for the easy access to the strip in airport and Aesthetics of the home.",-1,-1
If I could give zero stars that's what they would have. I sit and write this review at 4:40am because ppl are playing music at 4:40 at the pool with no consideration . I have had to call metro on the neighbors there is parties all the time throw up in the elevators and this is a every other night situation which I have to call security on. If you want to pay over $1500 for a one bedroom with no sleep and inconsiderate people move here. As for me I'm moving as soon as this lease is up!!,-1,-1
The security at the front gate is a joke. Most of them will pretty much let anybody in and rarely do I get a phone call about a guest at the front gate. Then at night they only have one security guard so a lot of times my friends will have to wait at the gate for a while before they come back from their rounds.   Recently they also decided to pulled out all the real grass and put in AstroTurf. It has made the complex look even cheaper.   The gym and pool is open 24/7 so that is really nice but besides that I can't think of anything else that is nice.,-1,-1
"If you need an inexpensive place to stay for a night or two then you may consider this place but for a longer stay I'd recommend somewhere with better amenities.   Pros: Great location- you're right by the train station, central location to get to old town and new town, and right by sight seeing his tours. Food, bars, and shopping all within walking distance. Location, location, location. Very clean and very good maid service  Cons: Tiny rooms  Uncomfortable bed  Absolutely no amenities  No phone in room  No wardrobe   Was given a lot of attitude about me and my husband sharing a room which was quite strange and we were charged 15 pounds more for double occupancy not sure why that matters I felt like it was a money grab. It was just handled in a kind of odd manner to me...   If you book this hotel all you get is a bed, desk, and a bathroom. It isn't awful but know what you're getting into.",-1,0
"Stayed here for two nights, costs was Â£109 per night for two people sharing a room which was not a budget price for what felt like budget rooms. Firstly they don't have any twin rooms in the hotel which would be preferable when I was sharing with a friend not my lover! There is only one small bin which is located in the bathroom.  No soap, which I find ridiculous, only toiletries were a dual shower gel/hair wash. There was a hairdryer but no wardrobes or drawers. Room was also very cold.   Now for the positive, the location is very good, close to princes street and St. Andrews square. The staff are very helpful and the bar is 24 hours.   Don't bother with the breakfast which is Â£9.50 each for a continental breakfast where you can easily get a cooked breakfast in any one of the cafes in Cockburn Street, which is adjacent to this hotel.   If I go to Edinburgh again I will book a different hotel.",-1,0
"Had Continental style breakfast here a short distance from Waverley Station as I had half hour before a train home and wanted to try somewhere new. Motel1One is nearby and a easy two minute walk, slightly uphill towards the castle from the station.   On entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.  I sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under Â£10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in.  Some hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.  Hmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea. Great place though nice breakfast and funky decor especially the plasma tv displaying a roasting log fire in reception, but sadly for me no easy access to wifi when badly required.  Maybe next time I will endeavour to try food against technology!",-1,0
"I'm not saying Pei Wei is the best asian food I've ever tasted, far from it, it's a fairly large chain that puts on the appearance of something more refined, it's essentially to Asian food what Olive Garden is to Italian Food.  With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name ""panda express"" (which is overpriced crap)  the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home, I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)  I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially ""un-F$@k's"" your food and returns it to you.

"My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.  I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................  Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.  Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!  Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.  Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.    Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............",-1,0

"Pei Wei is the fast food version of PF Changs. There's a long and interesting story surrounding Pei Wei and that of PF Changs. Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates ""Flows,"" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!",-1,0
"Kind of disappointed with the previous reviews in the area of customer service because honestly there was none. We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there. After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer. We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive. If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd.",-1,0

The salsa was a little blander than we care for.  Service seemed slow, but in all fairness it was Saturday evening.  I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas which had pieces of lobster sautÃ©ed with onion and tomato wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  It was average.  My husband had the Burrito Especial with a chicken burrito and a beef tip burrito.  Hubby said it was above average.  The rice had a nice flavor with an aftertaste of tomato and cilantro.  We were disappointed with the lack of complex flavor profiles that we have become accustomed to while living in the Southwest.  Overall, we rated it as adequate to good.",-1,0
Maybe let's work on the chili rolenos. Do nice large poblemo peppers like el rancho and you got me as a frequent customer. A+ on the guacamole! Large portion. Nice!,-1,0
"First time I eat here I came with friends who told me the food was the most authentic Mexican food they ever had, well it was not for me since it's not really Mexican but Tex Mex really. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either, I ordered a piÃ±a colada and the waiter spill it over me without replacing it not good at all, the place tries so hard to be unique and as Mexican as can be but it is just a caricature and a stereotype of anything Mexican honestly I was waiting for the three amigos to come out of the bathroom or something I despise decoration like this  and it affected the overall rating. Second time there food was not as good I ordered a dish that included carnitas in it but they were missing I told my waiter he apologized brought them in told me he was sorry but he charged me for them anyways even though they were supposed to be included. Not as bad as others but not great by any means.",-1,0
"The first thing I noticed here was the decor, which I have to say I liked.  Of course, yes, I enjoy lime green walls and bright pink color washes, but that's just me.    We had three little ones with us, so you can imagine that we were a little less than organized, but our server took it all in stride, which we appreciated.  He was also super fast; I think all of us were surprised how quickly our meals came out.   As for the food, I feel like it's a little difficult to review.  I had never been here before and my Mexican palate is less-than-sophisticated, so I randomly ordered a plain enchilada and quesadilla.  The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing.  It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it.      The chips and salsa were great, though.  And hot.  The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals.    I'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else.  Oh, and um, I wouldn't exactly object to painting my living room lime green, after seeing how cool it looked at Don's.",-1,0
"Sometimes you need a little spice in your life. Don Tequilla delivers. The neon sign beckons you inside and once there, sit back and enjoy.  The roomy booths offer space for cozy dinner or enough room for your whole brood or gang of friends. Nibble some fresh chips and salsa while you ponder your meal options. The salsa is fresh with tomatoes, cilantro and spice. In case that isn't enough heat for you ask for the special sauce from the kitchen for extra kick and spice.  I ordered the chili rellenos hoping not to be disappointed - this gal spent some time in Arizona and loves her Mexican food. These didn't disappoint. Yum. Served with rice and beans with a drizzle of red sauce.  Good enough to want to return and sample through the menu -- several other items caught my eye - fish tacos, nightly specials, burritos with tomatillo sauce!!!   The staff is friendly and patiently gives you time to check-out the menu and answer any questions. nom.nom.",-1,0

"So, I thought the food was average. But what makes this place is the cool interior and super attentive and friendly bartenders and servers.  We felt like we were part of la familia. I haven't felt that way in a Mexican restaurant, probably ever.  Fajitas did not arrive sizzling. Bummer.  My bean burrito and cheese enchilada were standard fare. Nothing to shout about. The beer was extra cold so bueno for that.  Very clean restaurant.",-1,0
"I left Table 17 feeling very ambivalent. Meh as others would put it. Some things good somethings not so great but on the whole in between.  The room is simple, farmhouse chic: long harvest table, ornamental roosters and wooden chairs with cushions for seating. Sundays and Mondays they have a decent prix fix menu on offer or you can order a la carte from their shared plates menu. I went with the steak frites and salad off the table d'hote. Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak. Dessert was chilled rhubarb with creme anglaise really lovely but too much sugar in the sauce and the sprig of thyme thrown in kinda messed with my tastebuds, I really should have plucked it out!  My server was a lovely affable gentlemen who was very friendly, warm and quick on his toes. I did like the service. But the food was so-so and I find that there are better bistro options around town.",-1,0
"Table 17 is a classic bistro with a very good menu, wine list and cocktail list.  I've been many times for dinner as well as brunch.  Food is always consistent, have never not liked anything I have ordered.   Dinner: have been numerous times have tried their salumi & cheese board ($15) with was good, not Black Hoof excellent, but still pretty good. Their steak frites ($21) consisting of an 8 oz top cut sirloin was cooked perfecting medium rare and served with a side of beranaise sauce. decadent and good. Have also had lamb here but it must have been a special because it does not appear on the menu.  Brunch: You need to order a side of their thick cut double smoked bacon. Its to die for. They also typically have cinnamon buns at brunch that are baked in house. My favourite brunch item on the menu has to be Farmer's breakfast with consists of a scotch egg (soft boiled, battered then deep fried egg), a terrine with toast and a small side salad. Surprisingly it doesn't look like its on the menu anymore :( Have also had the stewed eggs which was also good.  Note: If you are a member of Foursquare, check out their specials for check-ins, last time i was there for brunch you got a mimosa or caesar on the house with you check-ins.",-1,0
"I wasn't super impressed but I also wasn't really turned off, I guess my experience was mediocre with a little disappointment.   The restaurant in itself is very down to earth with only a slight hint of class. The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.  I found myself here ordering the much touted ""Hot Balls"" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the ""Diver Scallops"" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the ""Leg of Lamb"" and ""Wild Stripped Bass"" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds.   The Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal.   Overall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.  I hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night.",-1,0
Had an enjoyable meal at this Leslieville spot. Menu is light on  vegetarian options but is otherwise diverse. The tagliatelle was al dente and did not disappoint. My pal ate the steak and frites and licked the plate clean. My pomegranate cocktail was so sweet and satisfying  that I had two.,-1,0
"I came here with my sisters for brunch on a Sunday so there was free street parking. (Yay!).   The decor is nice and the tables are well spaced out. We were seated by the bar area close to the entrance. They have huge windows which are nice but get in your eyes in the day so we asked the servers to bring down the shades.   Service was decent but not the best since the restaurant was pretty full and they only had two servers.   The brunch menu is pretty diverse and goes beyond the typical french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs  with sausage/bacon/ham & hash browns deal.   I had The Sloppy Guisseppe, which is a plate of a couple fried eggs over bolognese sauce and fried polenta and fresh greens with a vinaigrette dressing.  The bolognese sauce was really meaty and thick - delicious and paired with fried eggs, you just can't go wrong. The fried polenta didn't seem ""fried"" as it wasn't crispy; not even around the edges which made the dish mushy...but then again, that's probably why it's called the ""Sloppy"" Guisseppe. I would have preferred if I had at least toasted bread on the side for a crunch or simply just a different texture (the salad wasn't enough).  My sisters had the Pain Dore, which is french toast with cinnamon creme anglaise & berries. They liked it and thought the creme anglaise was a nice alternative to maple syrup.",-1,0
"On a stormy, humid night in Leslieville, my partner and I stumbled upon this welcoming looking restaurant with the rooster out front, and it turned out quite well.  Though the category on Yelp is listed as French, I would say the food is much closer to Italian if you had to pick a cuisine.  Right off the hop the service was questionable. Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed.   Still, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.  And once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his ""little neglected table."" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.  Food-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the ""shared food"" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed.   Rich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a ""sugo"" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.  Alongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained ""sauce & balls"" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were ""al dente"" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.  Wines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's ""Anna 6"" white was very dry and very refreshing.   In addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was ""out"" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.  Total cost of meal for two: $77 + tip. This would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks.  I would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five.",-1,0
"Great service, the food and drinks were a miss.  Limited menu so we went with the waiter's recommendations. The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay.  POLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed.  Mains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons.   The recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere.  Overall, I'd have to be convinced to go back. Maybe if someone promised me I could get two polenta and some wine.",-1,0
"Had a travelzoo voucher for this place. Went on a weeknight with my bf. waiter asked to take our coats, I paused to think if I wanted it taken and decided yes. Waiter remarks ""might as well get your money's worth, right?"". I was a little offended at the comment, I'm not going to lie to you. I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my ""age"" and our voucher.   After that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time.   The restaurant crowd wasn't my style either. Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image. I prefer a more down to earth crowd (despite $ or age) and atmosphere- this could have just been the night we went (Tuesday). Food was good  but seemed slightly off mark. I expected better based on the reputation and price.   I honestly felt like we were given the ""pretty woman"" young+poor treatment. Guess you can't tell by looking at us that we have good dual incomes and no children to eat up our $.   Bc we had the voucher I didn't mind as much that we weren't taken seriously and that the food was lacking- we were underpaying for it anyway!  All in all the food is a lot better than most restaurants. I think my dish was possibly good but not put together with has much care on a that particular night. My mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic. Deserts were good too, nice and light.   I wouldn't chance going back and getting similar service while paying full price. It wouldn't be worth it.",-1,0
"Lovely ambience, we had a nice table for 2 by the window. I'm sure the table beside us could hear our conversation as we could hear theirs when there was a pause in ours.   The service started off being attentive and slowly started to slip (e.g. My date had to go find a waiter to get me a side plate for me to put shells from my seafood linguine, despite me having asked for it 5 min earlier). The fresh oysters were amazingly delicious and fresh!   I enjoy dipping my bread in olive oil and Table 17's olive oil was no better or worse then any other nice restaurant's. My seafood linguine was average. I believe my date had lamb and he said it was fine. We also ordered a bottle of wine and felt their wine selection was appropriate. Overall, we weren't blow out of the water and have made no plans to go back as we were expecting more. Make sure you make a reservation!",-1,0
"The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it's too expensive for it's location and quality.  It's still pretty good, I just don't like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch.    The good: - The food is good and the ingredients are top quality - Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees - Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu - They do potato rosti right - Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon - Good service both times I've been - Proximity to my house - they use opentable  The bad: - It is too expensive.  The breakfasts don't come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it.  Maybe I'm not classy enough to eat bacon here. - It's not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don't mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won't spend my $60 here instead of there. (both times I've been here Sarah T picked.)  No funny stories.  Would I go here again?  Maybe.  I might try it out for dinner one one of the BYOB nights.  Man, this place is just too expensive.  I know that's all I keep saying about it, but they charge too much for the food here.",-1,0
"I can't seem to make the half star symbol work because I'd give Table 17 three and a half stars. I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity.   I can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well.   Specials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops).   We started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red.   I opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites.   We passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!",-1,0

"I'm confused as to how to rate Table 17. When I lived in Toronto I ate here quite a bit for brunch and so when visiting the area again I was excited to go back.   The food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time. It used to be $4.50 or $5. I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar. So I ordered a regular one, followed by another regular one. I was shocked when the bill came and they were $9/each. Ouch!  My bad for not reading the menu fully and noticing they are not part of the discounted brunch drinks anymore.",-1,0
"For a small place, Table 17 is very accommodating.  I was a part of a very large party (10+ people) who could not make up their mind.  Various members called the restaurant multiple times to change our reservation.  I was horrified that when we showed up, they were going to turn us away (I would!).  But, they did not.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly.  The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy.  The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles.  The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive.   The drinks on the other hand.... Let's just say I'm very happy I wasn't paying ($15 for a basic martini).",-1,0
"Table 17 is okay. The hot balls are pretty standout although for $12 for 6 ($2 a ball) I'm not sure I would order them again (thank you miracle of groupon-type discount!). The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking. I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey. The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste. Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up.  My pickerel was a big bowl of meh. It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious. Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish. But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish.   Slinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints.  Portions are a touch small given the prices. You get a couple slices of decent bread before your meal.  Service is excellent.  Table 17 seems a nice addition to the aspirational bars that have cropped up in Leslieville along Queen street. The only thing I hate about Leslieville is it seems so dark. The strip needs some BIA work.",-1,0
"The things that I liked:  Interior was homely, lots of wood used on the walls & furniture, there was a chandelier & the bar had accommodation to dine at if you chose to.  Server was a very lively & attentive British man.  Some qualms I had with the place was that my drink was a bit warm & my food not warm enough.  The steak frites was excellent & cooked medium-rare. Steak tartare could have been a bit colder as the dish is meant to be served cold.  Shared PEI Oysters were very fresh & succulent.   For the prices paid, I expected a little more out of Table 17. There are better options out there for the price range.",-1,0
Had a number of high end shops in a really nice setting but the place was relatively dead overall on a Saturday night. Most stores barely had 1 customer in them. The stores didn't do anything for me.   Bottom line: Nice but I much prefer walking around the shops of Caesar's and Venetian.,-1,0
"Lots of great high end stores and a couple staples like Banana Republic and Victoria's Secret.  Lots of options for dining and a fun view of the ""Venice"" canals.  The reason why my rating is so low is based upon the number of irritating merchants trying to hawk their wares/goods.  Don't accept any samples from the brick/mortar stores either because as you can imagine they are pretty viscous.  The Tea store (?) store the salesman was so rude when I said I was not interested in trying their products.  I must have been approached by five or six different annoying salespeople as I'm trying to enjoy a leisurely stroll and shopping.  I must say my favorite place to shop is NorthPark Center in Dallas...no annoying kiosks or ""hawkers.""",-1,0

"Really nice shopping mall.  Beautiful with some really nice high end stores.  Some of its shortcomings are it's small compared to other malls or even casino shopping malls, it doesn't blow you away like the Venetian Grand Canal Shops or Caesar's Forum Shoppes.

When you win the Megabucks, you can afford to shop here.",-1,0
"I'm a little on the meh side for the Shoppes at the Palazzo because it's not a very inviting environment for shopping. It is true that some of the very high end, very up-scale stores reside here and without a lot of money its hard for you to enjoy this place. But wait!  The Forum Shops have JUST as many or similar types of designer stores ... why is it more fun?  Well in the end, I attribute it to the fact that the Forum Shops have some ""regular stores"" as to draw a crowd and shows which retain the crowd. You don't want to shop in an empty mall where you're the only person browsing the store (unless you REALLY don't care). I feel like a great shopping experience and the whole point of shopping in a store is for the interaction, direct or indirect, that you have with everyone else. When I walk into the Palazzo, it's so empty it makes me want to be somewhere else with more people despite the awesome designer stores.  This is not to say I will boycott the Shoppes, but it's definitely not my popular choice.",-1,0

"Te Cafe does tea well.They have an outstanding selection of teas, and they are very careful with brewing and all of that.

Also the fact that there is a huge sirens store here which has way more variety than Dix30.

It was the first mall I visited in Montreal so I hold many fond memories of the place :)",-1,0

"Drove out on the bikes on a gorgeous Sunday.   It wasn't overly crowded.  Overlooks the lake and many people dock their boats and enjoy the patio and food.   Lots of people taking food back out onto their boats.   Upon arriving, there is no sign telling you to sit down or see the hostess for a seat.  We walked around and into the bar and then we finally were told by the bartender that we can sit where we want.    The menus at the table were all different.   Three different menus, one omitted the burger and the other one didn't have the ""baskets"" on it.  Weird!!  The waitress knew that something was wrong with the soda guns and brought us 2 pitchers of essentially colored water.  When we finally mentioned it, she acknowledged that they were having problems with it.  After a while she brought us another one and said she hoped it was better.  It finally was.   The orange and lemon peels thrown on the grass, could be cleaned up as well.   Overall, the food was good.   Burger was juicy and flavorful and he bacon wrapped shrimp was really yummy.  The pizza at the table next to us looked delish and may be ordered if we return.  The place has some potential but a little makeover would be great!!!",-1,0
I can't figure out why their food isn't that great. They seem to use good quality products. Been there for breakfast and lunch and its meh.,-1,0
"I have visited The Lunch Lounge 3 times since one of their workers stopped by my office and dropped off a menu and some yummy cookies. The first time I wasn't sure what to expect so I got a Ceasar Salad hold the Ceasar please. It was okay, the chicken was good and none of the leafy greens were in bad condition. I guess I was expecting a wow factor when it came to the $6 salad I had received. they do brew Starbucks so I had decided to get one of my favorites. Hazelnut latte... only they were out of the Hazelnut Syrup. I instead got a caramel latte. Not my favorite, but it would do.  My second visit I was very excited to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Deluxe Roast Beef Press (only with 9 grain instead of sourdough) ! However when I arrived they had run of or roast beef, but I was told they were expecting their shipment to arrive tomorrow. Still hungry and not wanting to wait till tomorrow to eat I decided to try the Vegetarian Delight. $8.00 later my meal was... okay. Good sized, but in the end not what I was really hoping for when I had first came.  Today I went to give it one more try. I got the Sandwich ""your way"" which I ordered Roast Beef, imported Swiss, on 9 grain with Lettuce and Spicy brown mustard. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie and a Caramel Macchiato to wash it down. A total that came to $13.38. I arrived at my office and to my surprise my 9 grain bread turned into Sourdough - My least favorite bread...   To say the least I really wanted to like this place, but I am not blow away by The Lunch Lounge. I have given them a 3 for effort. - Also to add I found out this last visit that they only have soup on Tuesday's",-1,0
"Great little sandwich shop tucked into the office plaza (Follow the sandwich board signs to find it). I had the lunch roast beef special and it was really good. The red potato salad seemed to be missing something for my palate, but over all it was really good! Meat was tender, taste was good and no overpowering sauces.   Its a bit cramped in there so a togo order is a good idea, but its close to my other office so it makes for a perfect stop. Service was fast considering the crowd at lunch and the patrons and employees seemed to know one another.  Its a nice place if you are in the area, stop by and have lunch!",-1,0
"Tucked away in a very boring looking business park, you can sneak in for a great sandwich. Go around the corner and look for the Boar's Head sign. I had the Thanksgiving lunch special - turkey, stuffing, cranberry jam, and I held off on the cheese. Nicely toasted bread - all in all, a decent lunch!",-1,0
"I had the Egg-Cellent Burrito. Its name is not representative of the taste. It indeed did have eggs, but not the greatest tasting. They pulled the burrito out of the microwave so I assume that's how they cook it. I'd recommend checking something else out next time.",-1,0
I got the southwest chipotle chicken panini and it was good but not great. It also cost $7.99+ tax which is too expensive for a sandwich with no sides or drinks. I would come here again if a friend wanted to eat here but i wont come back again on my own accord.,-1,0
I really enjoy Jamaican food and was excited to see a Golden Krust in Charlotte.  The food was average and I didn't get to try the items I really wanted or any patties. I came in at 11:15 and they told me that most of the menu wouldn't be out til noon.    I may come back to try the patties.,-1,0
"Love the veggie patties, when they are available...haven't really eaten anything else there.",-1,0
"The roti here is an improvement on the other Jamaican restaurants I've eaten at in Charlotte. I'm from Brooklyn, so I'm used to having maximum food for a great price. Not so in Charlotte, for the minimal amount of oxtail, the price could be a bit lower. There is no reason to pay a high price for lots of rice and cabbage but a scoop of oxtail.   I'm definitely not expecting oxtails to dominate the plate, but the serving my daughter had was enough to convince me I won't be getting anything other than beef patties here. That is, when they actually have any available.",-1,0
"Right off the bat, don't go to this place expecting warm and cheery service. Just focus on the food to keep your satisfaction levels in check.  I met some friends here after work based on their recommendation. When we got there, it was empty (this was around 5:30 on a Monday evening) but definitely picked up as time passed.  This was my first time eating Jamaican food (I know!) and I wasn't all that hungry so I hemmed and hawed over the menu for a little bit. I went with the spicy chicken Jamaican patty and a pineapple-flavored Jamaican soda. There's a case of bottled Jamaican sodas or cans of American sodas (coca-cola, pepsi, or mountain dew). FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat.  I went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken. The chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful. It's definitely some I would order on my next visit. Also, the coco bread was/is a winner.  Overall, a good spot to get your introduction to Jamaican food and/or to indulge your already long-held affection.",-1,0
"This is a nice spot for some of your Caribbean needs.  You should definitely check it out at least once if you find yourself in the University Area.  It's small and tucked away in the shopping center, but you visibly see the sign for the place.  The menu isn't that big, so you for sure will not be overwhelmed with too many choices.  I have gone here twice now and definitely recommend the Goat Curry or the Oxtail meal.  I don't know about you, but when I ordered these, I also asked for extra gravy.  It was great to have the extra gravy with the rice and cabbage. Note that when you order the meal, it doesn't come with a drink though.  Kinda a bummer on that part.   The place is alright, pretty small.  They have tables near the register, and also near the back.  I haven't been towards the back to see how many tables there are as I have only gotten take out.  The prices are a little pricey to me, but the food was worth it.",-1,0
"Food is good, price is good I can't take that away from them to be fair. However I ordered a combo that included a drink and Jamaican bread(forgive my ignorance). I paid with my debit card then when I got my food that's when the woman informed me their drink machine was down, and they were out of the Jamaican bread. Which she then immediately followed up with "" no refunds"".",-1,0
"Great selection of hockey stuff, jerseys and gift stuff. Pricey, but if you want hockey stuff, they have it.  You enter here upon existing the Hockley Hall of Fame, or you can enter from the indoor mall.   Food and drink are just outside if you are exhausted and thirsty.",-1,0
"The Spirit of Hockey is technically the gift-shop for the Hockey Hall of Fame but you can still enter from the main entrance even if you don't want to go through the museum (even though you definitely should!)  This store is pretty much exactly as you'd expect: wall-to-wall memorabilia of all your favourite NHL teams. While I was mystified at first, it quickly wore off. It kind of became of game of laughing at all the ridiculous things you can stick a logo on (would you like some novelty cups to go with your keychain??)   However, the fact of the matter is that people do buy them so obviously there is a market for these things. I actually saw someone at the airport on his way out of Toronto carrying a giant Washington Capitals ""Man Cave"" sign that they had purchased at the store. I didn't exactly walk out empty-handed either (because who doesn't need a Harvey the Hound figure to sit on their desk??)  All of that being said, the store is well laid out and staffed by friendly, helpful employees, all of whom are enthusiastic to talk about hockey (or at least good at faking it!)",-1,0
"It is not really fair for me to write a review of The Spirit of Hockey. I do enjoy watching hockey.. but really not into buying any memorabilia or some cheap overpriced keepsake just because there is a NHL's team logo on it.   Anyway, if you have a friend that into that... and he/she might enjoy something from here...   But if you are from out of town hockey fan visiting, you will be really impressed to see all these hockey related merchandise all under one roof!   Now go spend your money!! :)",-1,0
Great place to enjoy South Indian food Thali was good along with mini tiffin  Pretty busy on weekends  Don't forget to try the coffee ( served in traditional stainless steel utensils) Washroom pretty clean,-1,0
"We went during Thanksgiving weekend and realized they only had a buffet for $14-15/person.   The dosas were brought fresh to your table. Dosas were made from chickpea and rice flour (i.e. not authentic). But all restaurants here use this method rather than actually soaking ""washed urad dhal"" and rice and then grinding them and allowing it to ferment (have a bit of a sour flavour which I love).   Sambar was warm but the idlis and vardas and other dishes were cold. Sambar tasted okay.   Three types of chutneys as well as lemon pickle.  I liked the hoppers dish.",-1,0
"The food was quite good but the service could be better. We went there 1/2 hour before closing and were rushed to order and our food wasn't even hot. They wouldn't provide refills to the ""sambhar & chutney"" as the kitchen was closed!!",-1,0
"EDIT:  I tried this place again almost after 2 years and it seems to have improved quite a bit. Possibly because of the new management. The food is much better now and we visit this place a couple of times a month and are pleasantly surprised with the changes.   2014 Review:  I'm really disappointed with the degrading quality of food and service at this place. I'm not a fan of this place, but decided to give it another chance as my friend wanted to eat here.  The place has been upgraded, which is about the only good thing with this restaurant. The new management is pathetic and the food equally worse. We went in on a Monday night for dinner and the waitress took our order and took close to half and hour to get our appetizer. The vada was spoilt and when we mentioned it to her, she just ran away and came back after a while to say that ""This is how it is"" !!! and she did not even apologize. How Rude!!!! She seemed to have a lengthy discussion in the Kitchen and another waitress came to our table and served our food almost 40 minutes later. She did however apologize for the delay. Much better than our previous waitress. We were appalled at the quality of service here and vowed never to come back here again and recommend people from going here ever.  If you'd like to get good South Indian food in Mississauga, goto either Udupi Madras Cafe or Chutney Swamy or Guru Lakshmi.",-1,0
"#SOUTHINDIANFOOD #SARAVANAABHAVAN #YELPGTA  I've been to Saravanaa Bhavan multiple times, a couple of years ago. It never was my ""go to"" place for dosa, but after an extremely unhealthy-greasy feeling at Guru Lukshmi one time, Saravanaa became a recent first-pick.   My dad and I decided to try the weekend vegetarian buffet. The restaurant gets super busy and for the South Indian food lover, this could be paradise. However, for a person like me who goes for selective items only (dosa, idli, chutney), this didn't exactly strike much of a chord in my heart. The dosa was subpar and I found the supply limited and fleeting. Every 20-25 minutes, the staff put out dosas that were gone in 5-10 minutes. Same story with idli.   It was fantastic having all-you-can-eat coconut chutney though. A lot of places skimp out on that one in particular.   Overall, an okay experience. I probably wouldn't return for a buffet. I'd like to select my kind of crisp dosa next time.",-1,0
This Saravanaa is not as well run as the one in Scarborough. The food is not that good. The dosa was cold & okay. The sambar tasted like spicy north Indian dal! I am surprised since I was under the impression that this Saravanaa in Mississauga will be better than the one in Scarborough.,-1,0
"Three stars for the absolutely amazing delicious food. They lose two stars from me because their service is HORRIBLE. Not only are they EXTREMELY slow, they don't actually care about it. They forgot half of our meal about 20 minutes after the first part was brought to the table they ""remembered"" one dish was completely forgotten about, had to ask (the girl who was sitting on her phone in the corner) to please it to us. We couldn't even get them to bring the bill after asking twice.   If you don't mind waiting or being ignored. At least the food is very good.",-1,0
"It seems that a lot of reviewers have already shared their strong feelings on the flavor (or the lack thereof) of Saravanaa Bhavan. To be honest, it's not terrible like some of the reviews would have you believe. But it's not particularly amazing either. Maybe if we had ordered from the menu, it would have been better, but we opted for the buffet option, and it was all... one-note... Not bad. Just not mind-blowing. It was food stuffs that helped fill our bellies before we left town. It's closer to a [*][*] experience in that ""I've experienced better"" but a lot of the [*] reviews are unnecessarily harsh.   I didn't touch the sambar. Sambar is one of those things that varies quite a bit even between two people from the same part of India. Personal experience has taught me that ingesting sambar (especially sambar that you've never had before) before a long road trip (or in my case, a long road trip and then a long plane trip) is asking for trouble and shaky leg syndrome.",-1,0
"5 stars if you eat at a saravana bhavan in Chennai,India, but not here. They are not able to create the same magic here.",-1,0
"I would like to update my review on this place based on my experiences since. I decided to try something different other than the usual thali. So I tried their Kara dosa, which came out to be a thick, soggy dosa with a sweet tomatoey sauce. Then when I visited again I decided to give their dosa's another shot and opted for their Mysore masala dosa, which I have loved in other restaurants. They warned me that this dosa is supposed to be spicy but I can handle heat so I was fine with that. But again, I ended up getting a overly thick dosa that was too soggy and tasteless. My brother got the chole bhatura, which he enjoyed but complained that the bhatura's were a bit too oily.  So I feel that ordering something other than the dosa would be your best bet because their dosa's are just not worth it and you can get much better ones at Guru Lukshmi or Udupi.",-1,0
"This place is always busy. We went for family day lunch. We waited for 10 mins after which we were shown our way to a table. After siting for 15mins (and waiting for the menu)  we were ""informed"" that they only have all day buffet that day.   The dosas were served fresh and piping hot and aloo masala was a favourite at our table. The rest of the food was average; uttapa, Idli and medu vadas were all cold. For dessert they had gulab jamun (avoidable) and rava kesari (yum).   In all a good place for South Indian food. The dosa and the rava kesari are a must have.",-1,0
"I have been to Sarvana Bhavan a zillion times, okay probably not zillion but you get what I mean :) if you are a true south indian food loyalist you will like the food. It offers good south indian food without the bells and whistles like Chinese hakka Masala dosa or the likes!! The food is very true to its roots and the chutneys and curries are cooked in chennai - tamilian styles.    The place recently was revamped and is more organized and looks much neater. The servers are polite and the food is delivered without a very long wait time.   I ordered the thali and it was very very delicious !",-1,0
"Loved the Delhi Sarvanna Bhavan so was here to give this place a try.. not sure if buffet time was worse time to try the food but my rating is for the buffet food.  Ambience: 4/5 (on any other day would have given 5/5, only issue it's a little small place to have a buffet) Service: n/a since it was a buffet I wouldn't rate the service coz there were a lot of people and food delays were natural Quality: 2.5/5 (food was average, not what I had expected and in comparison to what I have had) Quantity:5/5(since it was buffet) Overall, it was a 3/5 for me, deserts were too sweet food was cold. I will definitely give them a try but not on a buffet day",-1,0
"Worth a 3.5 star rating. We tried  the Rasam soup, Masala Dosa and Tomato & Onion Utthappam. It was all quite flavourful, though I found the soup to be a little too spicy. The mango lassi was quite nice and cooling after the soup. It was fairly busy on a Saturday night, but tables come available quickly and service is quick.  The furniture is a strange mix of marble style tables and old library chairs.  The floor was a little messy with bits of food, but otherwise the restaurant was clean. It's an interesting place; we'll be back to try some other options.",-1,0
"My mom took me here today. I've had random dosas here and there but am not much of an expert. Per my mom, the portions were excellent, the sauces/dips tasted good and were plentiful, and the dosa itself was very good. I thought it tasted quite yummy but spicy (my mom says that's the point!), and was fairly filling. Around $8 for a masala dosa, which like I said is a good sized meal.  Service was very prompt, and the lady serving us seemed pleasant. The restaurant was fairly full at lunchtime. You order at your table but pay at the counter.",-1,0
"We went to this location during the dinner hour. The service was good and the servers are friendly.   We ordered a dosa and I went with South Indian thali as its very different than Punjabi thali. The food was average and good for the price and quantity point of view.   The only thing which threw away the stars was; while were eating the dosa, at the end we found a rubber band piece in the potato masala. I told the owner when I went to pay and he was very apologetic and stated we should have told him earlier and he would have made another one for us.",-1,0
"Missing Hong Kong BBQ... found this on Yelp and was excited to try it.  But, the BBQ pork was extremely dry... was disappointed. However, the service was good and they had the ginger/green onion sauce which is a plus as most places either wouldn't have it or would charge you extra for it.",-1,0
"service was ok when buying a new car, but follow-up service after the sales guy has made the commission is non existent. i would buy again since I live in the area and love Audi's but not from the same sales rep, don't rmbr his name but he is the first desk on the right when you enter",-1,0
"The Shop Beer Co is located in N Tempe not too far from ASU ...  It's a smaller cozy cool independently owned microbrewery that I didn't know ever existed.  One of the girls in the group had purchased a beer tasting deal off of Groupon and it was as an amazing price/deal!!! The amount of beer that comes with this deal is ridiculous - no joke!!  It's a nice looking establishment - very cool inside look... There is also a large back patio, a food truck, and then the bathrooms are located near the actual brewery area in a separate building.   I am not a huge fan of alcohol, beer in particular, but I was open to tasting specialty micro brewed beers.  Some of the beers were awesome, some okay, some were hard to drink.  A place like this is for a true beer conoausor because they do offer a fair amount of diverse beers, but I don't know enough about beer, how it's made, ingredients, etc. to be overly critical about beer quality per say.  I would have to say that the darker beers here seemed smoother than the light/amber, and the beer made by/using coffee were the best tasting in my personal opinion.  When we first arrived the place was slammed - we could hardly find a place to sit down.  But oddly enough, the crowd died down very fast and by the time we finished our tasting around 7:30ish there was hardly anyone left in the place - it was dead for the most part, which seemed rather odd on a Friday evening.  The staff here was good - but no one was especially friendly or went out of there way service wise even when it got super slow....  The crowd seemed like college kids for the most part ... So it wasn't really our scene and I doubt I would go out of my way to come back here ... There is just too many other great spots to hang out in Tempe & Scottsdale.  This place earns a solid 3 start review because it was good/average ... overall there was nothing very good/exceptional or memorable about my experience here other than the fact that they offered a phenomenal groupon deal.  It's definitely worth checking out though, and I would recommend beer lovers to definitely come try it out!  If you are not a huge fan of alcohol or you don't like beer ... This is not the place for you because to my knowledge for the most part they only serve beer and water.",-1,0
"Bring your beanie and your judgmental hipster attitude!  I wanted to love this place but we had such a bad first impression. My boyfriend and I had gone hunting and showed up to this bar in our camouflage. You would have thought we were aliens by the way people looked at us. We just wanted to try some good beer via a Groupon I found. Service was okay but the overall atmosphere was unwelcoming. The beer was good. I enjoyed the Coffee Nitro. My boyfriend liked the IPA but thought it was a little weak for a double. Flavors were good overall. When we left I expected some sort of conversation and I would have left a tip. Instead we were told to redeem the Groupon on our own and that was it. Customer service is a must! My advice would be to welcome people from all walks of life, not just the local hipster crowd.",-1,0
"This is a cute little gem off of Mill Street. My friend that goes to ASU told us about it so we decided to make the drive from Gilbert and check it out. We purchased the groupon and each got a flight, a pint, and two crowlers. It really was a great deal however, they were out of a couple of the beers we wanted to try and the food truck is... meh. Pretty pricey for what you get and our chicken and fish tacos were a little dry. The chips and dip were delicious. Homemade chips with almost like a French dip. The environment is intimate and friendly and it's not usually busy. Not sure if we'd check it out again since we tried the beers we wanted to and weren't completely sold on any. BUT cute place to stop if you're in the area.",-1,0
"Delicious food.  Good service.  BUT-- if you are allergic to shellfish BEWARE-- they do not label all the dishes that contain shellfish.  You might order, say, the tomato bisque or the black cod, only to find out later (the hard way) that they contain such items as shrimp paste or oyster sauce.",-1,0
"Please note: Pricey, gourmet Restaurant Muramoto has moved down the street, and Kushi Muramoto has become a sort of ""Izakaya"" style place. Think Japanese Tapas. Reviews prior to November at this location should be thought as applying to it's new location, just down the street.   I was not impressed by the food at Kushi. Your order will come out quickly, because almost everything is fried, fried, fried. The exception is the Donburi -- something yummy on rice. Our Eel Donburi was solid, and decently priced for $8... but if you're a Midwesterner with a healthy appetite like me, don't think this will make a meal.   I also have a complaint about the drinks. My Cosmo was delicious -- and also standard Cosmo size and price ($7). However, because they make all their mixed drinks here with sake instead of vodka, what you're getting really packs much less of a punch than what you'd get elsewhere.  The pluses are this: The atmosphere hasn't change since this was the pricey Muramoto, So it's a groovy low-lighting place to hang. Also, it's really reasonably priced. $4 drafts. $1.50-$2 things on a stick, $5.50-$8 for Donburi. So you can go out and feel like you're getting the ""Muramoto Experience"" without bleeding yourself dry.  However, when they said ""fried Snickers are our only dessert and they're only 2 for a dollar,"" I was so sick of panko fried tidbits, I said ""no"" without a moment or regret.",-1,0
"I had my first visit since they turned into a tapas bar style spot.  Got to say, they're still serving the best ""imitation"" of the real stuff - doesn't really fly by me.   But if you like that kind of thing, I suppose it's ok. Depending on the bartenders, some drinks are so underwhelming that it made me feel unnecessarily girly.  Oh well.   On the positive note, I think it is fun to try out many small plates. So 3 stars for the fun factors. The hype doesn't match the food, though.",-1,0
"I just moved to Phoenix and decided to try this place out. It's very clean, lots of colors to choose from, and close to my house. Every time it come in here they seemed very rushed and try to get you out of the door as quickly as possible. No room for relaxation. One time I did back my nails done by Steven, he's by far the best and takes his time. I'll probably be branching out if I can't reserve with him in the future.",-1,0
"Had an appointment at 4:30. Hit bad traffic and called to say we would be 5-10 minutes late. Got there and it was not as if anyone had just been seated -- they didn't skip a beat with getting folks in prior. So, we had to wait. No one looked up and acknowledged us. Waited until 5:00, when we were finally acknowledged and we had to mention the appointment time that has long passed.  My daughter asked for shorter nails twice and nail tech did not listen. 5:45 and still here. Frustrating.  Tips:   1. Honor appointments.  2. Greet customers as they walk in.  3. Techs need to listen to their customers and also consider their age. My daughter is barely 14, and asked for shorter nails but did not get what she asked for. 4. When nail techs aren't busy, do not sit in front lobby area on your phone with headphones on all kicked back.",-1,0
"So here's the thing. This isn't an Indian restaurant. No matter how you spin it.   The ""naan"" is actually pita. The kind you buy in stores. There are three or four Indian curries on the menu.  We got the chicken curry. The guy (there was only one person there, to cook and work the counter, but they weren't busy, so hey) said it was really good. If you're desi, you know what shan and all the boxed masalas taste like, and this definitely had that taste.   Not saying it's a bad thing, but fresh masalas give a curry an aroma that this lacked.   The chicken shish kabob was bland, except for the red chili powder added liberally on top, and it wasn't actual shish kabob.   The best thing I had was the lamb burger. Oh my gosh. The lamb was super juicy. And the fries already had black pepper. Loved it.   The place is super duper clean. Even the bathroom.   Like I said, there was one person to cook, serve, answer calls, and take orders. He told us the others were out for a catering.   This is in no way true Indian food. The shish kabobs aren't Indian shish kabobs, but rather Middle Eastern kabobs, the naan isn't true naan, either.   Don't go to this place expecting awesome Indian food. But it is a decent place to go for a burger or the pizza.",-1,0
"Was expecting a lot from this place based on the reviews, but honestly we didnt love it. It was just OK. Service was quick and friendly. They were also happy to oblige my dairy intolerance, which was nice. Both the seafood and steak were good quality, but I guess they were just a bit boring.   Boyfriend wasnt so keen on the strange warm, limp cabbage on the side of the steak. Although the steak was cooked as ordered (medium-rare) which was good. The queen scallop starter was OK, but the scallops were quite small and over-salted. Mussels were pretty good.   Overall a decent meal, but not good enough to get us over to Grassmarket on a regular basis.",-1,0
"So you get mussels or you get steak.  We both got the steak.  It was our first day in Edinburgh and the restaurant was recommended by a friend.  Food was okay.  My steak wasn't all that flavorful and the chips were a tad bland as well.  Also, my food arrived to the table warm, not hot.  Y'all know how I feel about that.....  A little pricey but not really worth it.  Service was very good.",-1,0
"Came here with family for dinner on a Saturday night. We booked in advance, but the place wasn't terribly busy in the end. The atmosphere is quite formal and a bit quiet, rather than bustling and busy. I went for the red curry mussels, as did my husband - my parents got the traditional with shallots and cream. The servers gave us the wrong mussel pots which took us a while to figure out, as all the sauce collected at the bottom and wasn't really coating the mussels, so we honestly couldn't tell whose was whose initially. We had to take some of the huge portion of mussels out and put them to the side, so we had space to use our spoons to coat the remaining mussels in sauce. Once we managed that though, the mussels were very tasty and fresh. The sauces were mild, but added a nice subtle flavour to the dish. Sides were decent but basic - slightly soggy fries, steamed seasonal vegetables, nothing terribly exciting. The price can't be beat though, at Â£14 for an enormous meal.  Not the most memorable of meals, but an enjoyable one. I think a loosening up of the atmosphere would go a long way.",-1,0
"In University every Monday was the night reserved for a couple of pints and a few games of pool. I still have fond memories of those nights spent with my house mates and when we get together now and then, someone always brings up a pool related story or joke.  Walking into Petrina's Taps and & Billiards for the first time recently, the similarities  to my old pool hall brought back old familiar memories of my University billiards nights. Everything from the sounds of laughter or someone racking up a new game, to the smell of the velvet table tops mixed with tap beer and mixed drinks. Even the dimly lit room seemed all to familiar. I loved it.  Arriving later in the evening, my friends and I were unsure how long we would be playing for and didn't know if we wanted to pay the hourly rate of $15/Hr (even though it was very reasonable). Upon expressing this to our server he recommended that we use the $1/game table. What a deal!! With the average game of pool taking about 5-15 minutes why wouldn't we explore this affordable option?!  Several libations later we had played 8 games over 2.5 hours, saving ourselves $37 by playing the $1 tables. We didn't even have this kind of deal when we were students!  Pool is not something I regularly play, however if I am ever in Ajax again with a hankering to play, I'll be sure to head back to Petrina's with a pocket full of change.",-1,0
"Definitely not the classiest joint in town... or maybe it is...?  The tables are old(er) but the felt is still in relatively good shape. Some of the cues have cracked tips but if you look, you can usually find one worth playing with.   Monday and Tuesdays they have $5 pool from 6pm to 11pm (although I think that's gone up to $6 recently)... either way, you can't complain about that.   They have a fully stocked bar and will make tea and coffee on request for those of us who don't drink. They also have a half decent menu with food that's prepared downstairs at Texas Burger (yum).    You're pretty much in view of a TV wherever you are and they have a large projection TV in the lounge area allowing you to sit, eat and watch the game.   I'm not saying it doesn't happen but I've never seen a rowdy crowd here and although I've been to better halls, this place is okay for a fun night out.",-1,0
"I have been going to DT for over 5 years.  For a dealership, I find they are pretty fair in the pricing and they do some extras, like wash your car for you.  You can also have your scheduled maintenance (like oil changes/tire rotation) done on a Saturday - they are open until 4 pm. For those of us needing our cars during the week -- it works great.  If you drop it off around noon - you can check out Dark Horse Coffee across the street, or Burger Shoppe, or Prohibition, also if you want Brunch there is Bonjour Brioche just up the street (great quiches and baguette!)  Also, Toyota has a loyalty program now (no cost to enroll), and all your maintenance spend gets recorded, and you can use points towards service or other items.  The time before this time my Oil change was free.",-1,0
I've used this dealer intermittently since 1999. They do repairs well the first time but have had mistakes the last few visits. A couple years ago they left the window down and soaked the back seats when washing it. There was no apology or warning when I picked it up. I had to buy garbage bags to carry passengers the next couple days so they could sit on them. This past visit for regular maintenance I Was called because there were a few light bulbs out. I said I would do it myself and I found them changed anyway and the $38 added in at the end of my bill after pick up. I was going to do it myself because I already had spare ones in the storage and it takes 3 minutes or less. I'm becoming very skeptical about any dealership in this city!!!!,-1,0
"A few weeks ago received a letter from downtown toyota, saying that they're very interested in buying back my 2013 Prius c, I didn't think anything of it as I'm very happy with my car.  So a few days ago, I received a call from a Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, asking me if I was interested in selling my 2013 Prius c back to them, and that they can compensate me, and give me some kind of offer on a new car.  I've never been asked for a buy back, so I thought what's the harm, I thought I go and see what they were going to offer me.  At first nothing was laid out clearly, but we slowly got to see what the numbers were, because all I wanted to see was the numbers, that's all I wanted.  Lisa stepped out and I talked to the manager (indian) directly,  we talked for a while,  still couldn't get a confirmation on what the set monthly payment will be, he wanted me to say yes before giving me the final offer, then he started to get very impatient with me, I felt very uncomfortable/pressured,  we ended the talk and that was that.  Before going home, I went over to the service department to chat with an advisor, I had some thing I wanted to ask him, then Lisa came back and started giving me better offers, now that I have the numbers, I see what I was actually into,  but I decided the better option of me was to keep the car that I have, and continue driving it.   Throughout the whole process, Lisa stayed really patient and professional, but I kept saying no and they kept giving me better offers.  At the end, I decided not to trade in for a new car, but Lisa still gave me a warm good bye, but another manager (caucasian) still trying to strike a deal, asking what would be a number I'm happy with, said he can tried to see if he can offer me a 90 days free of payment, I wasn't bluffing, I really was there to see what the offer was and decided I am better off with not trading my car, at the end he question me what I came the first place, which I did not appreciate.  Overall, I highly recommend anyone looking for a toyota to talk to Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, but I would be very wary of the managers there, and do your research before going.  The indian manager told me toyota will still continue to offer the the prius c and prius v (wagon) for another two years, which I am not sure if he is just saying that to make a sale, or if it's confirmed.  From my understanding, the prius c/v will most likely not get replaced, and only the standard prius, and maybe later a plug in prius will be added to the line up.",-1,0
"Dipped cone all the way! This location is tricky because it gets very busy in the evenings. Best route, don't go in the drive-thru, park your car and order inside. It's quicker and easier!",-1,0
Very nice and new. Staff is always friendly but the drive thru is ridiculous. Two burgers and a diet soda and Im still sitting here 10 minutes after the fact? People have stuff to do. I could cook a meal at home in this time.,-1,0
"Nothing special about this place, their ice cream is ok. On busy nights drive thru is insane and impossible to turn left out of here. Prices are high too. The employees are really nice and it is a clean store.",-1,0
"Don't believe the hype!  After seeing this location on Man vs Food I had to check it out for myself. I have given this location two back to back chances and it was a disappointment on both occasions.   The place is defiantly a dive and not the cleanest. One our first visit on a Saturday night we ordered two 4 piece chicken dinners for my wife and I and one 2 piece chicken dinner for our daughter. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait and the place was completely dead! The four piece chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh and drumstick, coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about a party in my mouth! The chicken was hot and juicy and cooked just right and seasoned to perfection! The fries and slaw were good also.  The employee's attitudes and customer service skills are in need of as much of a makeover as the dining space needs. The second time we went was the next day as we were on our way back home from Cleveland and got a 20 piece chicken to go. The girl at the cash register was on her phone the whole time I placed the order. I understand that it's a slow Sunday afternoon but, really?! She had a really foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered with taking orders. She was acting like actually pausing her phone conversation to take my order was a major inconvenience to her.   It took about 25 minutes to get our chicken the second time which is weird as I ordered a lot more chicken the second time. I would defiantly call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food it WILL be a while.  The chicken is very good but, not worth the wait and dealing with the employee's bad attitudes. I'd much rather go to Zanzibar for their delicious honey fried chicken. Hell, I'll eeven take Church's Chicken instead!",-1,0
"Hot Sauce Williams has some pretty poor BBQ, mediocre fried chicken, and an odd sauce that they'll put on either one.  Of course then there's the polish boy. I'll explain.  This place has become a Cleveland landmark, probably more from visits of Anthony Bourdain and ManVFood than anything else.   There are a number of similar spots in Cleveland and you have to respect it for what it is.  It's not the kind of place that's trying to win competitions here.  It's more of a fast-food style cheap BBQ.  On our most recent visit we got a polish boy and some fried chicken.  A polish boy is a kielbasa, fries, coleslaw, and sauce on a bun.  It's an unrefined mess and it's pretty tasty.  In my opinion their chicken is so-so.  The service seems to be down to business.  I wouldn't describe my experiences as overly friendly.  If you're an out-of towner I suggest trying it for what it is.  The polish boy is uniquely Cleveland.  The neighborhood is characteristic for much of the east side of the city.  It may not be pretty but it is what it is.",-1,0
"Pretty solid / cheap chow. But not BBQ Line moved fairly slow but i didn't expect fast food. Staff was polite and playful  I ordered the chicken/ribs combo. ($10) -The chicken was pretty tasty, but the sauce poured all over it made it instantly soggy. -the ribs are smoked/grilled then BAKED. that said they had good flavor and texture. -the sauce is just plain not good. tastes like sweetened tomato juice. it worked okay on the ribs but ruined the chicken. -mac n cheese is meh -greens are cooked sweet. not my style.  Def work a quick meal if you are in the area, but don't go out of your way.",-1,0
"Painful to watch this slow disorganized mess try to handle just a few orders at once. Took 30 minutes to get our food and that was because we accepted other chicken pieces than what we ordered because they said it would take longer. Short story long: if you're in a hurry this isn't the place for you.  On a positive note; the ribs were very good even with a little too much of their hot sauce on them. But the ribs weren't incredibly meaty. The chicken was nicely fried, but they put a bit too much hot sauce on it. The fries and mac and cheese were good with the hot sauce.   An odd mix resulting in a 3 star experience",-1,0
"This is a funny place.  Being from Youngstown, and not Cleveland, I went here after my Cleveland Clinic appointment, because I saw this place on Man vs Food.  I went there for one reason only...the Polish Boy.  The service staff was really under-enthused to wait on me...even though I was only 1 of 4 people in the whole joint.  The 1st lady who I said hi to pointed me in the direction of the stack of paper menus, without saying anything back to me.    The Polish Boy, was not on it.  But after asking the lady at the counter, they DO still have it available.  It's a kielbasa on a bun, topped with fries, coleslaw, and BBQ sauce.  The TV show also added pork shoulder to the sandwich, but for some reason, they didn't put it on mine.  It was awesome nonetheless.    The place was a dive, doesn't look that clean, and it's located in a not-so-great side of town, and the service was lacking any personality.  However, the Polish Boy was GREAT.  I would definitely have this again.  I hear their other food is good too, but the PB is all I wanted.  3 stars for the food.  0 stars for the service.  Letter Grade:  B",-1,0
"The food is good but the service is slow.  This means do not go there for a quick to go food.  I ordered a side of ""mac and cheese"" and fries.  The ""mac and cheese"" was already prepared but it took them 20 minutes to get my fries.  There was no sense of urgency amongst the entire staff, they just assumed everybody came to spend their entire day in the restaurant waiting for food.",-1,0
"My son and I stopped here on our way home from vacation. I wanted a polish boy, but Seti's is closed on weekends. This place had a good rep for theirs. I had the polish girl (polish boy with pork shoulder). It was tasty, but didn't think its size justified its price. Paid over $9 for something noticeably smaller than a regular hot dog. Yeah, it had fries and a can of soda, but still.....The sauce was good, but don't expect it to be hot. We waited a long time in an empty restaurant for anyone to come up to the counter to take our order. She saw us, but kept wandering around not really doing anything. Seemed like they were out of everything. No chicken sandwich, no corn fritters, no fried chicken breasts, and a few other things the people behind us ordered. The woman taking our order acted like we were bothering her and that she was doing us a huge favor by doing her job. There was a cheap boom box blaring awful music you coudn't get away from no matter where you sat. I don't care one way or the other about decor, but if you do, don't go here. Table cloths look like cheap shower curtains a 4yr old picked out, and there is a cheap entertainment center in the dinning room. Who puts an entertainment center in the middle of a restaurant, lol? All in all, the food tasted good, but wasn't the best value, the service was crap, and the decor was laughable.",-1,0
"oh God....I think this may be my first review where I add the tag line ""for Cleveland""....I'm so sorry that I have to use it here...  So, this is decent BBQ....for Cleveland.  Decided to commemorate MLK Day and a former Yelper by patronizing Hot Sauce Williams.  We had both been wanting BBQ all day long and figured today was just a good a day as any to give it a shot.  Reading the previous reviews, I found it quite funny that we wound up getting the exact same thing as Amy T. and her dining partner!  Ribs, coleslaw and fries for me...4 pieces of fried chicken, mac and cheese and fries for my gluttonous dining partner ;o)  But, getting to the point of ordering was an ordeal in itself!  We walked in and there were no menus posted....looking around for a couple of minutes, I was almost ready to go up to the girl behind the counter and ask her ""so, what do you think we should get""...but I was kind of afraid to do that because of the response I envisioned in my head *cringe*.  So, I was pretty thankful when we finally looked around and found some printed up menus of their offerings....but, in what kind of order did they put these things?  There was no rhyme or reason to half of the menu, very confusing.  Ordering was an event in itself, I started ordering with one girl and then she just walked away in the middle of my order, and then another chick came up and kind of finished it....I mean, I agree with Stef C. on this one, would it kill you to put a smile on your face and actually act like you enjoy getting paid??  Pluses, it was cheap, and it was fast, we had our food in less than 5 minutes and were out the door to enjoy it at home.  Portions were HUGE, holy crap you could feed a family of four on the two dinners we ordered, neither of us could finish our meals.  Sauce was decent, ribs were a little grisly, chicken was pretty good....but in all reality, eating BBQ in Texas and Georgia has ruined me.  HSW is decent BBQ, for Cleveland.....this place would be out of business so fast in any of the Southern states due to the attitude you receive behind the counter and for the simple fact that it's just not that great when compared to some of the great BBQ places around the country.    Let's just say I think my BBQ craving is over until summer comes around and all the Yelpers can get together and do a proper cookout.",-1,0
"Decided that I had to check this place out since I am a huge fan of Adam Richman and he featured it on Man vs Food. He also wrote a section on Cleveland in his book, 'America the Edible', and he name drops this spot.   My fiancee and I were not disappointed, it definitely hit the spot. I loved the sauce. Ryan tried the Polish Boy which basically a kielbasa, with sauce, and cole slaw piled on top. The french fries are smushed in on the side, but definitely a tasty experience overall. I heard that the wait on the ribs was 30 minutes so I opted for their fried chicken which was crunchy greasy goodness. For a fairly quick bite I definitely recommend checking this place out.",-1,0
"I found the ribs here underwhelming, they tasted a little overcooked and tough.  However, fried chicken is really good here. Not overly breaded, perfectly fried, and the chicken itself is warm and tender. Get the sauce on the side, since I'd imagine you are getting takeout and the last thing you want is the chicken to turn into a sloppy mess by the time you get home.   Wait times have been surprisingly long (on the order of 20 - 30 minutes) despite how there is almost no line. If you come here hungry and stare at the food while waiting, this will be torture. At least they give you so much food that it still amazes me to this day how they actually manage to fit it in the takeout box.  Eating here regularly is ill-advised, if nothing else because I would prefer to not require the services of the world famous (and strategically close) Cleveland Clinic cardiologists and cardiac surgeons.",-1,0
"Good fried chicken and sides.  I had tried some of their ribs at the Taste of Cleveland last year though, and wasn't too impressed since the meat was a little tough and the sauce, just OK.",-1,0
"All the shoppes at the Palazzo are expensive. This is like the Rodeo Dr of California or Oak Street in the Gold Coast of Chicago. It is not like at Ceasar's Forum shops where there is a lot more variety.  I like to window shop here and wish for things I can not afford, but the sales people are very pleasant here.  They offered water bottles while I shopped at Tory Burch's for a specific purse my daughter was raving about. **Also important to mention is I was almost swindled into buying some ""sea-salt"" cosmetics from La Savon. It's nothing more than the other cosmetics sold in kiosks throughout Las Vegas and elsewhere...I was curious how they managed to have an actual store front shop. The woman there tried to sell me 2 bottles of makeup first for $599, then went to $199 in a matter of minutes to get a sale. I flew out of there as quick as I could. Thankfully my husband made some excuse to leave.",-1,0
Large selection of high priced shops.  Looked like more people were just walking around rather than buying anything.,-1,0
"We wandered around here early one morning right after most of the shops opened.  The place was empty.  We seriously saw very few people as we walked around (I think they were all sleeping off their hangovers).  The fountains and umbrellas are pretty and make for pretty photos.  The shops are a mix of average to very expensive shops.  We walked in a few and the people were friendly enough.  There are some cafes and restaurants toward the far end (we were coming from the Venetian).  It's a nice place to take a stroll, but it's not shopping for the average person.   Besides the central gardens/fountains, the place was pretty boring.",-1,0

"Ate here when I arrived in the evening on a business trip. It was a strange restaurant. There was a large buffet that appeared to just be supplies (not for customers).   The waitress couldn't answer any of our questions. My colleague and I both have fairly typical food restrictions (I don't eat meat; he's Celiac/gluten-intolerant) but the waitress didn't know what would be suitable for either of us. The menu did not indicate some key ingredients, either (like that they use bacon fat on the green bean sides).   She asked the chef and he suggested a salad for my colleague and a pizza for me. The pizza a 6-inch flatbread. It was ok, but felt like an appetizer.   Overall, it was fine for the lazy evening after a long day of travel, but I wouldn't go again if there were other choices.",-1,0
"Attention to detail on favorite comfort foods such as the Shrimp and Grits and Fried Chicken with charred cabbage results in lively fresh takes on tradition. However the staff was not up to par, the hostesses could not pull up our reservation, waitress got our dessert order wrong, forgot what my entree was immediately after I ordered and there was that discussion on what Prosecco is. That being said, this is a newly opened restaurant and there is clearly a lot of field training going on. Just wish the staff was better prepared. Rating would be higher except for the service. We'll be back in a few months after the kinks are worked out as the food is so worth it.",-1,0
I came here last night while on a business trip. I was not too impressed. The food was decent but the service not so much. We sat on the outdoor terrace and the waitress forgot about us. For appetizers we ordered the calamari which was light and delicious. We also had the shrimp and gnocchi (only came with 3 pieces of shrimp) and the wings which were good but nothing special. I ordered the fried chicken confit which was good but not as flavorful as I had expected. It's conveniently located in the hotel but next time I'll venture out into the city.,-1,0
Food was good. Had to wait a very long time for eggs and sausage. Team seemed to be short-staffed in the kitchen. The wait impacted my overall experience. I expected more efficiency from a 4-star hotel.,-1,0
"We came in after watching a sunset up at Bar 32 on a Friday evening. I had read all the Burnham reviews and looked at the menu on line. It looked very promising. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away.   We had a reservation which was not required. 40-60% full during the peak dining hour. Service while attentive was only hotel restaurant style, Lacking the type of service professionals found in fine dining establishments. The menu was very well composed and interesting. It offered some good choices. But the preparation and presentation was just ok. The prices were not outrageous.   No way it gets 5 stars. So not a destination place in my book. If I have to meet someone staying in the hotel, I am happy to have a meal there. But no more Burnham date nights for me.",-1,0
"I went here for dinner a few weeks ago. My friend and I were planning to do apps and drinks at the rooftop bar, but it was closed for a private event so we decided to head downstairs for dinner. A lot of things on the menu sounded really good to me, but I went with my usual go to and ordered the salmon. It was pretty good, but was just super salty so not the best I've ever had. My friend ordered the Southwest shrimp pizza, which was amazing! We were one of only 3 or 4 tables in the restaurant so service was great. The prices were about average with most restaurants downtown so nothing too shocking.",-1,0
Good food. Way over priced as everything is extra. Tried copying Teds Hotdogs in Western New York. I'll wait for a road trip back home to get my dogs at a much more reasonable price.,-1,0
"I don't know how they stay in business.  There's never anyone there.   The dogs and milkshakes are good.  It can't hold a candle to Swenson's, but it's closer to where I love, so it's still a contender for me.",-1,0
"Not what I was expecting. The ""retro"" style was only apparent by the colors of the restaurant. 1990s music was playing.  The food was nothing to write home about. The same veggie hotdog can be bought from the local grocer. The vegetarian coney sauce was nothing fantastic. Fries are not fresh cut. Not especially delicious. On a positive note, my mud pie shake was delicious. Friendly staff. 2 dogs+2 fries+2 shakes dine in= $20.81  Overall, it was mediocre. Not worth the bill.",-1,0
"I appreciate what they're trying to do here. They went all-in on the retro drive-in look and unique variations on the dog-and-burger menu.   I've tried three different dogs and one burger; fries and rings. The meat and fixings are fine -- not spectacular, but OK. On my most recent visit, the poppy seed bun for the Chicago dog was distinctly stale. (I've run into a similar problem at some other places, where they don't sell many Chicago dogs so the special poppy seed buns sit around for far too long.)  I'll echo what at least one other commenter said: The sodas are bizarrely small portions. They boast about their own root beer. In house, it comes in what looks like a nice-sized chilled glass mug, but turns out to be largely ice. I got a to-go version one, and it was a tiny cup, again with the ice -- and filled to the brim so that spilling was inevitable.",-1,0
Nothing fancy at all.  I was expecting something like Chicago dogs.  Pretty small also considering it's a hot dog place,-1,0
"I love a good hotdog. I was out with my son and we came across this place. It looks like a new place trying to look old. So, the name is perfect. The layout reminded me a lot like sonic and the drive ins back when I was really young. The interior is really nice and I thought they did a great job of decorating.  I ordered the Banzai dog and my son ordered the White hot dog. We also decided to get a large order of fries to split and my son got a root beer. We went there about a week ago and my son is still talking about how magnificent the root beer was. He also loved the hot dog, but said it might have been a little salty. I thought that the banzai dog was also fantastic. The banzai sauce is really what makes it. You could put that on just about anything and make it taste good. Plus, its covered with bacon..   Whenever I order fries and I see that they are fresh cut fries, my brain automatically thinks Malt Vinegar. I grabbed one of the containers and took it back to our seat. We were seated along the windows so when the light hit the container, something caught my eye. It looked like there were 2-3 ants floating in the bottom of the container. I took the container back to the counter and gave it to the person there and showed them, told them I thought they were ants. Then I noticed all of the vinegar containers had this substance in them. I went back to my seat and a few minutes later the manager shows up with a pan, in which she had poured out the vinegar in to show me they were not ants. She explained that it was a fatty spongy substance that collects in vinegar containers. I told her that I have several different vinegar containers at home, some that I have had for 2+ years and I have never seen this substance. I She said it is common and found it on the internet. So of course I asked the obvious question, ""How long has that vinegar been in those containers that it would have this fatty spongy substance?"" She told me that they empty them every week and refill them. Now, I know I look like I just fell off the yam wagon, but I find it hard to believe that your vinegar forms that in a week and mine hasn't in over 2 years. My ten-year-old was able to ascertain that you were full of crap so needless to say, your excuse needs work. I wasn't asking for a free meal, just say ""Geeze, that's gross.. let me get you a new one.""   Regardless of the vinegar incident and the manager clearly trying to cover her ass, I thought the place was great. I will probably return again if I am in the area, but I think I will skip the fries and vinegar.",-1,0
"I have to rate my visit as a 3 this evening (unfortunately). And really that's pushing it. The hotdogs were excellent; however, the fries were over salted and oily, the onion rings were dripping in grease. Very little onion and way too much batter. Please, please change your oil! The root beer floats - well let's break that down; root beer was great but the custard ice-cream seemed to have ice chips in it. Not creamy, but ""ice milky"". Lastly Retro Dog should have ""Retro"" music. Stick with the dogs and you may enjoy your visit.",-1,0
"Retro Dog is a cool place to stop if you are out in the Cuyahoga Valley or at Blossom and feel like a snack or some ice cream.  Kind of separate from anything else, you will see a large take out with parking out front where you can have the food brought out to your car or go in to the cool dining area.  The decor is bright and in your face in a good way, kind of a very modern expression of a 50's diner.  The menu consists of hot dogs, sandwiches, sides and plenty of ice cream based desserts.    I have had the veggie retro dog, the fries, onion rings and a couple of milk shakes, overall the food is good, not great.  The veggie retro dog is a pretty nice veggie hot dog with veggie coney sauce, mustard and onions on a wheat bun.  The mild hot dog has a nice snap but it could have used more of the toppings, especially the coney sauce, which is a mild veggie chili.  The french fries are fresh cut, but were not terribly crisp.  The onion rings missed the mark with the fried batter overpowering the flavor of the onions and they seemed a bit overcooked.  The 2 milkshakes I tried were the best items I had at Retrodog; prepared fresh with soft serve ice cream.  The flavor selection is extensive and they have some unique flavors for you to try.  The chocolate banana was a nice balance of the banana milk shake with hot fudge; the salted caramel was a nice balance of sweet with a hint of salt.  Overall good shakes, especially using soft serve ice cream as the base.  Retro Dog is probably not worth a special trip or the place for a full meal, but if you are in the area and need a snack it is worth a try.",-1,0
"I really wanted this place to be amazing. The food is just okay. Nothing too spectacular. I didn't find a WOW factor. I do feel like it is REALLY expensive. For my boyfriend, daughter and I, we can drop $25 easily and thats not getting a lot of food. At all. I do find the service to be hit or miss too.",-1,0
This was our second time here.  The first time we came the service was slow and they kept forgetting parts of our order.  It wasn't even busy.  The coney sauce wasn't very good on our first visit so this time ordered our stuff without it which was much better.  The service this time was better but we also ate inside too.  Their custard and fries were great both visits!,-1,0
Went there on a Monday. Placed looked like a slow night.  The selections were interesting and the fries Tasty.  Got two of there special dogs(Chicago and Bonzai). Buns were very stale and i think the dog was on the griddle a little too long. If I'm in the neighborhood I might give them a try gain but nothing I would go out of my way for. On a positive note the Employees working were very attentive and nice.,-1,0
"I normally like retro spots like these. This one didn't really wow me. The food is extremely greasy, kind of flavorless and they cover all the ice cream in chocolate syrup. The service was pretty speedy and I've never seen it jam packed so you can get in and out quickly. Decent place for a quick bite or if you live in the neighborhood and want to walk up it would be a nice little walk.",-1,0
"This was a nice change of pace from our typical road trip meal stops, but it was nothing that blew my socks off. The dog was fairly tasteless (I'd rather have my store-bought Hebrew National any day) and while the toppings were decent, it was nothing that made me say WOW, I WANT ANOTHER. I tried the home brew root beer and again, it was decent, but I like Barqs better. The best part of the meal was the fries. So, an A-OK stop and if I lived close I'd definitely try other menu options...but as a one-off stop, it didn't thrill me as much as I'd hoped.",-1,0
"Got the #1 - 4 Regular burger pack w fries and drink $7.99.  I wish I got the cheeseburger it has more flavor the regular was a bit dry. But nevertheless it was fluffy buns, grilled onions and tasty. I realized there is no real sauce in these burgers but grilled onions gave it flavor. I've tried the frozen ones it's similar but these were more fluffy buns and softer meat patty the frozen ones were drier.",-1,0
"Im from NY and loved it there, but this was not as I remembered.  I bought a crave case, all the burgers were warm and dry like eating toast.  They all had some kind of freezer burn marks on the edges of the patty.  I remembered it being steamy and delicious, I hope they improve because I love WC!",-1,0
"We have eaten the White Castle freezer pack sliders and I was curious to see the most western White Castle location in Las Vegas. None in California. The sliders are almost identical except for 2 things: these ones contain a pickle and the bun is more moist, some were soggy. I got super indigestion after eating 4 of these guys. It was nice to try once in person but that's it.",-1,0
We finally tried White Castle. The line was unbelievably long. The service was friendly and quick in helping. The hamburger was different then any burger I have eaten. Their very simple and tiny. The burger is super thin and small  which includes a pickle and a few chopped onions. The bun is super soft but delicious. The combination of cheap and small makes you want to come back for more. Unfortunately you will need to order quite a few in order to feel full. Sometimes simple is better. There is no glamour to these burgers. The restaurant is full of people with happy smiles. Unfortunately the location needs to be cleaned more often after people eat at the tables.,-1,0
"White Castles are not a common sight in Los Angeles county.  Friends say that they were once plentiful, but I understand that they have retreated to the comfort of the east coast. Save this one. This White Castle is all alone out here in Vegas. So, it was on my list of things to see and experience in Las Vegas. I'd never had one. Not even from the grocery store. I'd even seen all three of the Harold & Kumar movies about them. I was super excited. Well done White Castle!       So, I parked my ride back at the LINQ self parking, and hiked down this way to get to the Treasure Island for the Pirate ship battles and the Marvel thingy. It was quite of a hike to thie point. Several times I pondered giving up and taking the Monorail. But I persevered, and this was a well deserved stopping point. The Las Vegas strip is deceptively long.        As I entered there was a bit of a line at the counter when I walked in. The sounds of the nearby casino jingled and buzzed and tempted through a huge opening in one wall. I assume the White Castle is open at all hours to collect the hungry gamblers. Which is probably alot, as the smell of burgers wafted across my nose as I looked up at the great big menu to figure out what I wanted. Looking at the items, the prices ranged within your usual 'fast food prices'.      There was a range of options. Meat, other Meat. Fake Meat. No Meat. All the glutens, none of the glutens. Even Vegetarian and probably Vegan options. I saw a sign for a double cheeseburger combo (little teeny ones) and decided that's what I wanted. I wound my way through the line and got to a register, and ordered one from the nice lady behind the counter.     I was given a cup and a receipt. I took both to find a place to sit. Easier said than done. This place was pretty popular. Eventually I found one at a high common table. I set my camera bag and phone on the table corner to mark it as being taken. As I went over to get an iced tea, I heard my number called. I altered my trip back to my table, and veered back over towards the counter to pick up my tray of food. I was excited, I was eager. I was going to try White Castle burgers. I reached into my bag and withdrew the three small boxes inside.      Hrm. These three tiny things are supposed to fill up me? Seriously? Hrm. Ok. After the yelp photo, I carefully pulled out the miniscule burgers, doing my best to save the buns from ripping. I excitedly took a bite of one. It was okay? I was not as awed and amazed as Harold and Kumar were. I wasn't overwhelmed and taken away on a meaty dream sequence of awesomeness. I was just kinda sorta whelmed.     Even the iced tea was that fountain done stuff. Not brewed iced tea. Meh. I'd have rather been eating a Carl's Jr. Big Carl. But. I'd finally experienced it. Checked it off my list. That's part of the excitement of life I suppose. To get out there and try new things. Sometimes they're just not as great as the commercials.",-1,0
"Tiny burgers (eh hem, really they're SLIDERS). Good flavor mainly attributed to the grilled onions but these things are small. The patty is paper thin. Makes me wonder if I'm ingesting beef or any kind of real meat for that matter. I'm not a big girl, but I swear I could have killed like 20 burgers (eh hem, really they're SLIDERS) if our group didn't already have reservations for Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse. I was there for Superbowl and this location had just opened so the wait was pretty ridiculous over the weekend but we waited in line in the late afternoon so our wait wasn't as bad.  We waited about 30 minutes and thankfully not in the Vegas heat.",-1,0
The hype was there. I think it was overly hyped but I get it a little.   We parked at the Venetian and walked outside by where Sephora was at and its tucked in a little casino. But you will be able to see the White Castle sign.   When we got there the lines were not as busy like we hoped it would be. It took me a long time to come just because the hype made it impossible to come. Thank god we waited though.  We ordered 20 like cheeseburgers sliders. They also has beer for you beer drinkers. They are like I expected little tiny cheeseburgers with 1 pickle Alice and some onions. For some reason it did taste good. But it taste like how the frozen one would taste at a grocery store.   Although those sliders were tiny I did get start to get full off 3.   I probably won't be returning here unless one of my tourist family members want to try it out. It wasn't a horrible experience I just feel like there's nothing special about White Castle. Maybe it's better on the East Coast!,-1,0
"For starters...for all the people giving it low stars because of the wait they had to endure yesterday (this review is being written the day after the Grand Opening), you're all morons.  Seriously.  What in the world did you expect?    As far as taste goes, White Castle is not for some.  I can't hate on people not liking it if it's their first time.  I'm also well aware there are FAR more better burgers available, but sometimes you just want a White Castle that is cooked unlike any other burger.    The burger tasted like I expected, and the cashier, who I'm sure wanted to rip her own head off, was a sweetheart.  Being the lines were so crazy, I asked her if anybody in her team had walked out yet, and she said ""we're soldiers!"".  I loved her attitude, and I wish I had remembered her name.  My gripe, and why it's 3 stars, is with their pricing.  I know it's a strip joint, but there are other chains that charge their regular prices on the strip.  A few steps down is a Chipotle and a McDonald's that charges the same as any other one of their locations.  I don't care that rents are higher on the strip and it's their only location.  Whenever they come into town...locals CRAM THEIR FOOD TRUCKS for their burgers.  They could have just as easily chosen an off-strip location and made a killing off of us.  I split a Crave Pack that came with 10 hamburgers (we paid extra for cheese), 20 chicken rings, and 2 regular fries.  Large sodas ($2.99) were separate.  The bill came out to $38.88.  I'm sorry, but $19.50 for 5 cheeseburgers, 10 chicken rings, fries, and a soda is lame.  For $20, I can come up with 50 other places I rather eat at.    Also, they offer a combo that comes with 3 cheeseburgers and regular fries for 8.77...WITHOUT A SODA.  That's just wrong considering fountain soda usually has the highest markup of any of their items.  They could've easily included the soda.    I won't be going back, but I'm hoping that they'll open up some off-strip locations and possibly offer the pricing that other White Castles are used to offering...because at the end of the day...this is White Castle, not Five Guys (or any other burger joint of your choice).",-1,0
"It's White Castle and since there none in California and you need your White Castle craving you might as well stand in line and eat your steamed sliders.   It's located at a smaller casino called Casino Royale which is sandwiched between the Venetian and Harrahs.   Some people love these sliders, I'm not a big fan but my boyfriend loves them even bought a 10 pack to bring back to home.   They sell packs of 10, 30 and even 100.",-1,0
"A east coast comfort food that reminds you how sometimes, you need some cheap food to fulfill your needs. It just so happens Vegas isn't a place to fulfill your needs. If your drunk, gambled all your money, desperate and hungry. This is the spot. Other than that if your in the west coast and desperate for some white castle fast food drop on by like I did.",-1,0
"The only times I've ever been here is when I / my friends have had a lot to drink.  So from that aspect, its very good drunk food.  The staff is for the most part very patient which I appreciate b/c I know they deal with jerks all the time.  My major complain is the cleanliness of the sitting area which is very small, it can get pretty gross in there and had it been cleaner I would have given it an additional star.",-1,0
So I finally came to see what the hype was. I have had these before on the East Coast and knew what to expect. It was nothing to get excited about but these are pretty good sliders. The staff is amazing about getting everyone through the line and the food comes out quick. So mad props to the employees and their good service. I give it three stars because it just isn't a big deal. Be sure to order double what you think you can eat. Otherwise you'll be hungry. I enjoy it but not a frequent stop for me.,-1,0
"I was very skeptical to try this spot because of all the bad comments I got from my friends before coming here. But I liked the ones that you buy from the freezer so that was enough for me to give it a shot anyway. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn't great either. Surprisingly there's always a line specially past midnight. I'll have to be drunk to eat here.",-1,0
"Went here on a busy Saturday night and there was ONE PERSON taking orders and over ten people on the assembly line - extremely poor management of man power.  There were workers goofing off or just blankly staring off into space.  I felt bad for the guy taking orders.    Food wise: sliders were OK, nothing special and definitely over hyped by the movie Harold and Kumar.",-1,0
"The Las Vegas restaurant is in a tight location. It's a small place in which the restrooms are located next door in the casino. Although they seem to have a sufficient number of tables.  Orders are placed at the counter and your number is called when the order is ready for pick up. At the time of my visit the order line moved slowly because only 1 of 3 registers were open. The order was filled quickly even before I reached my table.   Being from Chicago what can you say about White Castle other than ""It's an Institution"". But in Las Vegas it becomes another choice in the growing Burger business. Glad they are here because fresh is better than frozen and I won't have to satisfy the crave when visiting Chicago. Buy them by the sack.   One difference here is that they do not have onion rings. They have onion chips. These are basically rings that have been cut into pieces. Just as good as the rings. Just place several on the slider.",-1,0
"Like everyone else, I was super excited to try this place after watching the movie ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"". Sad to say that I didn't enjoy the food very much. Ordered each item from the menu and the only good thing was the little chicken sandwich. Services was good and fast though.",-1,0
"OK, let's calm down here, people. It's just White Castle. Is this really something to get excited about?  If you happen to be in the area and you want to try it for the first time, be my guest. I would skip the fries if I were you. The onion chips are a much better bet.  Sorry, vegetarians, but there are no veggie sliders to be had here. Rise up and be heard! (Tip: they're made by Dr. Praeger's and they're available in fine grocery stores everywhere.)  No matter what you eat or don't eat, you probably have dozens of better options that you could walk to from here.  ""The Crave Is A Powerful Thing""? Well, then I guess it doesn't matter what I tell you.  Bon appÃ©tit.",-1,0
"Closest thing to a typical grocery store in Kensington. Not too big but they'll have most things you'd need. They never really have sales, but the prices aren't TOO bad. Obviously you'll want to get your produce somewhere else in the market. Open until 7pm.  Obligatory Title Pun: ZIMMER down!  Menu Readability: Oh, so not applicable.  Need to mention: Minimum order of $10 to use your CC or debit.  What this place teaches me about myself: I moved to a part of town with absolutely no grocery stores.",-1,0
"Major props to Zimmerman's for being open on Christmas, NYE and Thanksgiving!  I stumbled into Zimmerman's one Christmas while searching for baking trays. I had gone to Chinatown in the hopes that something that would be open would sell baking trays, but sadly my hopes were mercilessly dashed. Zimmerman's being open taped up the broken pieces of my heart!  It's a normal grocery store and seems adequately stocked. The prices could definitely be lower: I was happy to pay for the premium of being able to buy things on Christmas afternoon.  You can't use debit unless you purchase $10 worth of goods, but that's understandable at an establishment of this size.   The owner is a friendly guy and runs an A-OK grocery store.",-1,0
It is sort of a failsauce art museum.  However the Bellagio itself is an incredible work of art.,-1,0
"Las Vegas is not known for it's museums and other artistic endeavors. This is one of the few places where you can come to see really great art. I've been coming to this gallery for many years before I lived here. It was one of the few things I actually wanted to come to the Strip and do when I came to visit my sister who has lived here for 20 years.   The Art - They try to do at least two shows a year. I've seen some great art while out here. Don't think you are coming to the Met or something. This is a small small small gallery, but you see some great works. Right now is a Warhol exhibit, which I found pretty interesting. Some have bashed the pieces shown, but I've seen several Warhol exhibits so it's nice to see a different side. I just love art, though, so I'm usually always happy to see anything.  Cost - Tickets are $16 but what can you expect in Las Vegas? For locals you can get half price on Wednesday nights. I went ahead and bought a membership, which allows me to go as much as I want with a guest. I'll put it to good use too.   I suppose I could give a four star but really it's just kinda ok. If you are use to bigger museums then you may be disappointed. I was also disappointed that they turned the gift shop into a store to buy over priced prints. I really like being able to buy something small to remind me of an exhibit that I've seen. Oh well, another reason why I gave it 3 and not 4 stars.   If you love art then I'd say go. If  you are only ok with art, maybe go ride a roller coaster or something along those lines. You might be disappointed.",-1,0
"The Gallery is a nice alternative to the stereotypical Vegas activities. I was here for the Warhol exhibit.   For the size of the of the exhibit and the cost, I wouldn't recommend it unless you love the artist. General Admission, out of state , is $16. This is high considering you can go to MoMA in NYC for $25 or the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburg for $20 and see his work as well.  You could walk through the show in 5 minutes if you didn't read the picture placards or listen to to hand held audio device that was included with admission.",-1,0
"OK, so when I was there they had Monets. i think that earns a three star rating all by itself. They did have a couple significant pieces, but in general i found the gallery a little lacking. I can't say why, I was just expecting a different level than I experienced. Everything aside it was an opportunity to be up-close with over a dozen Monets so I would probably have to do it again.",-1,0
"I went to see the Warhol exhibit, they had a limited amount of pieces.  I'm not sure if they were real or reproductions.  Which puzzled me.  I kept looking close and the numbers next to the name said 2 of 32, so I'm guessing they were special limited repos.  I'm not an art expert or anything I just wanted to see Warhol's work in person.",-1,0
Went to see the Warhol Exhibit this weekend and I can't believe it was $16 for 15 minutes (or less) of Andy art. They give you a telephone remote thing so you can get more information on each piece if you like. The exhibit was super small. Only did it so I can say I've seen his original work but unless you're a crazy Warhol fan I'd say save your money.,-1,0
"I'm not an expert on fine art, but I can appreciate something beautiful, something that has survived for centuries, and anything with historical significance.  So anytime there is an art gallery nearby, no matter what the exhibit, I do enjoy stopping in to take a look.  My husband and I were passing some time on our last day in Vegas while waiting to leave for the airport.  Figured the art gallery would be a nice, relaxing way to spend an hour or so.  Entrance fee ($17) was relatively inexpensive, surprisingly, seeing that everything else we'd done in Vegas up to that point had been rather pricey.  I can't remember the name of the exhibit we'd seen - it wasn't anything too famous like Andy Warhol (earlier this year) or Faberge (coming soon).  But the paintings were mostly early 1900s it seemed.  We were also given little handheld audio devices where we could listen to more information regarding maybe 20 of the paintings.  The only issue I had with the gallery was that it was rather small.  Maybe 3 or 4 rooms.  We definitely went through it in well under an hour, and when we got out we were like, That's it?!  Not that a gallery can't be small; it's just not what we were expecting.  Art galleries are my go-to thing to do when I run out of other things to do.  I would definitely go back again if there was an exhibit that sounded interesting.",-1,0
"The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art may not be comparable to galleries found in major metropolitan cities, but it's a much appreciated gallery that Las Vegas is fortunate to have. It offers visitors the opportunity to view artwork by renowned artists.  Finding the gallery can be an adventure. Being a local who's somewhat familiar with the layout of the Bellagio, I've never seen the gallery before and had to ask for assistance on its whereabouts. The gallery is tucked in another wing in the Bellagio, away from the boisterous sounds and excitement of the casino. If you know/can find Cafe Gelato, it's within close proximity.  Here's a rundown of the current ticket prices:  General Admission:  $16 *Nevada Resident: $13 Students, Teachers, and Military: $11 (High School student IDs only) Children 12 and under: Free  *Nevada Resident prices are $8 on Wednesdays only from 5:00pm - 7:30pm.   I came here on a Wednesday to take advantage of the $8 Nevada Resident price, which I'm glad I did because I wouldn't have paid the full amount to see an exhibit. Like some reviewers have mentioned, the gallery is very small, and you'll be in and out within an hour at max. There's a free guided tour device that makes me feel like I'm Zack Morris talking into a brick phone. It's complimentary, and I'd suggest grabbing one because the plaques don't have much details about the art.   For art lovers, the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art might be a good place to visit, but  for someone who's only mildly interested, I might just skip it all together and view the art online instead.",-1,0
"This gallery was small and expensive.  Sure, the quality of the collection was top notch, it is after all, in the Bellagio.  If they lowered the price to $10, it would be a little bit more reasonable.    My main gripe is that they won't let you take photos of the art work.  not even without flash.  The paintings were made before copyright laws, so I don't know what the big deal was.    I doubt I'll come back unless if I could get in somehow with a discount.",-1,0
"We saw a very good show on the architecture and design of City Center. The docents were very helpful. One offered to get me a pencil and paper to take notes. The audio guide could be more informative, but it was fairly decent. The gallery is a good deal if you are a Nevada resident. They offer a special locals night on Wednesdays for $8 per person. It is a bit small, but consider that a plus if you wish to get in depth with the exhibits.",-1,0
"I came in with a friend to check out the ""Warhol Out West"" tour.  I'm not a huge Warhol enthusiast, but I really enjoy several artists that were inspired by his work.  So we figured we would come and check out the original.    Let me first say that the Bellagio cannot really control what the Warhol people choose to display.  So I won't hold this against them.  But I will say that the pieces chosen were odd.  None of them said a whole lot about the artist.  And that gets me to the other failing, there wasn't much to look at.  There were three small rooms with relatively bare walls.  At first I thought the ticket prices were decent, two of us got in for 24 dollars.  However, after getting through the exhibit in just over fifteen minutes, I couldn't help but feel let down.  More than ten dollars for a few minutes of glances, and nothing jumped out as inspiring or monumental.    The audio tour included was dull, and rambled on a lot about things that weren't too important.  And there were also an absorbant amount of security in the place, lingering over our shoulders the whole time wondering if we were taking pictures or not.  I get that important art must be protected, but so many guards ruined the immersive experience one is supposed to have while at a gallery.  With such an alluring figure as Warhol, I went in expecting to be entertained.  I wasn't concerned about the ticket price.  But after leaving feeling more than unfulfilled, I had to wonder if maybe it all should have been a bit cheaper.  All this said, I'm glad the Bellagio is displaying art.  And I welcome other exhibits, hopefully on the more interesting side.",-1,0
"I went here to view the Andy Warhol exhibit.  The exhibit was short, just a few rooms.  They had some of the most phenomenal pieces.  There were styles that I had never seen before, and the explanation was quite detailed.  I would simply not go here expecting an exhibit of the Art Institute of Chicago proportions.  You may feel like you overpaid a bit, but you're in Vegas so the gauging shouldn't be a complete surprise.",-1,0
"(I have only been to one exhibit here, so until I see how other exhibits fare, 3 stars. Also, this is a piece I wrote for a magazine that never published it.)  ""People either love Andy Warhol, or they hate him"" quipped Warhol Out West exhibit tour guide, Gina, ""And I think he loved that people felt that way about him.""  It's easy to see why people feel so strongly. In today's world of Instagram filters and Photoshop, people may look at his work and say, ""I can do that!"" or ""that's not art!"" But don't let the simple or mundane of Warhol's style fool you. He spoke about society through his work in a very tongue-in-cheek way.  The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art's showing of Warhol Out West, is currently displaying 59 pieces of his work on loan from The Warhol museum in Pittsburgh, the birthplace of Andy Warhol.   From the famous soup cans, to screen tests, balloons to ballroom dancing instructions, the exhibit has a little bit of everything from Warhol's work. Also included in the collection are less famous works, such as his Polaroid pictures of celebrities, which have influenced the likes of celebrity photographer Terry Richardson, or Warhol's rendition of American Master Charles Schreyvogel's ""Breaking through the Line.""  Portraits of Geronimo, Annie Oakley and General Custer, along with others from the ""Cowboys and Indians"" collection, are on display. It is in this collection that Warhol's critique of society shines through.   When the docent turned to the small crowd gathered around her, she asked ""So what do you think of Warhol's work?""  Two people on the tour had competing ideas about it. ""I just love how he could see beauty and form in the everyday piece and elevate it to high art"" and another observer, ""We're standing in a five-star resort, and paid money to look at balloons and soup cans. This was clearly one big joke to him and one big eff you to pretentious people in the art world. He turned his joke into a money-making deal for himself. Good for him.""  For those unfamiliar with Warhol's work, this exhibit is the perfect chance for you to pick a side - was Warhol serious about his art, or was he making a buck while simultaneously saying through his work, ""don't hate the artist; hate the art game?"" You decide.  Audio tours are available all day and docent led tours, which are highly suggested, are offered every day at 2 p.m. Tours are free with admission. $16 general admission, $13 for Nevada residents, $11 for students with ID.",-1,0
"We generally visit this gallery while in Las Vegas and this trip was not an exhibit.  Make sure you receive an audio wand which will make your visit that much more enjoyable.  The current exhibit, ""Town and Country: From Degas to Picasso"" was organized in conjunction with MOFA in Boston.  I did not feel many of the works on display represented the featured artists, including van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, and Toulouse-Lautrec, best work though the informative panels accompanying each work of art and the recorded description (see audio wand) proved to be interesting.",-1,0
"I appreciate art, but certainly not a sophisticate.  Or rich.  Wanted to come here because the exhibit was Women in Art, so brought my two young daughters.  My family has visited several art museums across Europe, so I knew the girls would be interested.  I knew the price before visiting.  Kids are free and retired military was $11.  What makes me give it a meh was the size of the exhibit.  There were probably 30 paintings, 20 of which had audio (with an included audioguide).  Hard to spend more than an hour there, which might be nice for the casual observer, but disappointing when you factor in the value.  Normal admission is $16 - for comparison's sake, entry to the Louvre is 12 euro, about $16.  There are two Georgia O' Keefe's in the gallery, and to me the most impressive pieces of the exhibit.",-1,0
"The atmosphere is very loud and crowded joint. The casino is next to the restaurant so you can hear people gambling and making noise. I instantly noticed this place was popular due to the large line, so I was intrigued to see what all the fuzz was about.  Ordered items: Combo #2 which came with 4 cheese sliders, some fries and a drink. The burgers were nothing special. They were good, but I will definitely not go out of my way to get these burgers. I would say 4 sliders are equivalent to 1 full size burger.   I was told this place is the east coasts in-N- out. In my opinion, it doesn't come close. The concept is interesting with the sliders, but the overall quality of the burger Isn't great.   Overall, it was an interesting experience. The line was too long and the burgers were average. I would recommend you only try if the line are short and you're very hungry.",-1,0
"Came here last week for lunch. Finally made my way here 11 years after the movie. I didn't have too much expectation coming here. Had the regular beef sliders, chicken sliders, and cheese fries. The beef I found was pretty thin, but the toppings and the fluffy bun def made it taste above average. The chicken lacked toppings and was a tad dry. The cheese fries are good, but you could probably make your own easily at home. Overall, it was a mediocre experience for me. At the end of the day, it's fast food. So if you just want something relatively quick and cheap, this could be one of your options.",-1,0
"The only white castle burger I've ever had prior has been the microwaveable frozen kind. A last minute decision to eat something reasonably priced lead me here. So here's my verdict:   Cheeseburger- 2.5 stars  JalapeÃ±o cheeseburger- 3.75 stars. The white cheese is a nice change of pace from American cheese, adds a slight kick and adds an extra oomph to the overall burger compared to the regular cheese.  Fish burger- 3 stars  Crinkle cut fries- 3 stars. Just average.  Onion chips- 3.5 stars. Good breading, nicely fried. Have had better but not too shabby for fast food.   7 burgers, one drink, and onion chips came out to about $19.   I'll be back for the onion rings and the jalapeÃ±o cheeseburger.",-1,0
"I wish this place lived up to the hype. I mean Harold and kumar had a whole adventure trying to get to this place! Anyway, we came in at around 6pm on a Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a long line. We ordered sliders with the American cheese and jalapeÃ±o cheese, fries, chicken rings, onion chips, and a drink. We also got the brownie and cheesecake dipped in fudge for dessert. We wanted to try everything on the menu basically lol the food came out pretty fast. It really fell flat on the food. Everything was really bland. There's no seasoning whatsoever on anything. The sliders were kinda soggy. The onion chips had such a thick coating with no flavor. The best thing we had was probably the brownie for dessert lol it's cool to try if you're curious since it's quite famous. Just don't expect a lot so you won't get disappointed.",-1,0
"Harold and Kumar sure make it seem like this is the place to be. For many years, I have been wanting to try this hoping that I would be blown away from the taste. Since they do not have this chain down south, where I stay, I had not been able to taste it.  Until one day, I was driving by the vegas strip and noticed it tucked deep in the sidelines of the Casinos.  After some tricky parking, and a long trek I was finally at the register ordering the cheese slider meal.  At first glance, everything seemed good, heck it sure did make for a great instagram post, which is mandatory for me on all food I eat.  After the first bite, I was left unimpressed.  I would easily rank Fatburger and In and out above this chain and even Mcdonalds.  It was definitely great to finally try it but would not go out of my way to do it again.",-1,0
This place was pretty good! Had never eaten there beforem the staff was efficent in how they made and delivered their food.,-1,0
"I wanted to try this place because I heard from people that it was a good fast food joint.  To start off, their location is quite terrible. Unless you are walking on the strip, it takes quite an effort to get to the restaurant since you have to go through people and traffic, park at a casino, then walk down the strip to eat here.   When it comes to waiting, the time you wait in line to order is a lot longer than the time to get your food. My friend and I ordered #9, 3 cake on a stick, chicken rings, and onion chips. Literally, right after we ordered it took about 30 seconds for us to get all of our food.   The quality of the food is disappointing and it might be because of how busy they are. The sliders weren't anything great and their fries are not crispy at all. Their chicken rings didn't have much flavor in them either. However, their onion chips and cheesecake on a stick were amazing.  Their service is a lot better than I assumed. The worker who took my order was extremely kind, patient, and helpful. Everyone looks like they're trying their best to work as quickly as possible to meet every customer's needs.  To be honest, White Castle is okay but it just wasn't for me. The food isn't worth the wait like people think it'd be.",-1,0
So our 1st time @ a real White Castle. ..not at the frozen isle....not bad bout the same tho....they had beer on tap a plus !  Hmm just not that exciting.....very pricey but it is Las Vegas. ...sure I'd go back if I was real hungry. ..,-1,0
"A White Castle on the west side of the country!  Being from California, I'm surprised they have invade this state yet.    Tried the Las Vegas location on a short trip recently.  It's a bit tough to get to.  I parked at the Venetian and took the long walk all the way to the strip to get to the restaurant.  It's not necessarily big but there should be enough tables to accommodate who's in line.  If you've had White Castle before, I always say its good if its late night eats or if you're pretty drunk, or both.  Other than that, the food isn't exceptionally great.  In fact, it's actually a bit on the expensive side.  A four slider meal with a handful of crinkly fries and a coke goes for about $10 after tax.  Not really cheap.  You actually might still be hungry after that.  I don't hate it but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I think it would be a better value for your buck.",-1,0
"I am from the Chicagoland area so I have been eagerly awaiting a WC to come to my area.  Only gave a-ok due to two things... 1) The fries were almost hot but considering there was a line to order and pick up, can't figure out why the fries would not be cooked properly and served hot. 2) Parking..... Good luck if you don't know the area, OR park at Venetian and walk down to the Strip. The burgers were awesome!  Didn't like that you could only order burgers in a combo fashion. Prices are high!! But I suppose that is to be expected on the Strip. Hate to say it, and I prefer In-n-Out..........",-1,0
"It was exactly as how I expected it to be. Sliders were just like the frozen ones I buy at the grocery store. People hype up this place too much and I blame Harold and Kumar for that. Food here is just like the food at the White Castle in Chicago.   Beef patties are thin, just like the frozen ones. Slider is small, exact size like the frozen one. Service here is ok, just like how it is at with any other fast food chain. They do however, have other options to choose from other than cheese sliders and the original sliders. Line is long but moves quickly and food comes out quickly. Just like any other fast food joint.   Don't come here and expect it to be a 4 star restaurant. It's just another 3 star fast food place.",-1,0
"Ok ok ...so you know how I was major hating on White Castle in my first review...well, I'll give it 3 stars this time around!  Came here on Fat Tuesday after some drinks at The Linq. Ordered the 10 mini burgs with cheese, large fries, cheesecake, and cheese sticks.  It was cool. I mean, for $20 or so, it was cool.  Burgers were hot, fresh, bite sized.  Cheesecake was REALLY small for being a cheesecake (on a stick!).  I think the plus was the funny cashiers and the 10% OFF FOR LOCALS!!!!!!!!",-1,0
"I had my first experience with the White Castle (WC) food truck at the Great American Foodie Fest held in San Diego. I always heard of the business--known for their sliders--and was always interested in tasting one of their products. I guess I just assumed that WC was like the McDonald's of the East Coast, and I wanted to see what it was about those sliders that made them so great (especially after seeing the White Castle excerpt from ""Harold and Kumar"").   There were pre-organized queues and a HUGE WC tent, so I'm sure the vendor expected mile-long lines. However, when we went on the first night the foodie fair was open, there was NO line; only a few people were in front of us so we didn't have to wait long to order and get our grub.   Final verdict: After all that hype, I think I was slightly underwhelmed by those sliders. Maybe it's just because I was different from what I was expecting. Was I glad I tried them? Yes, definitely. Would I crave them late at night? Not so much ... if I were craving fast food late at night, I would probably go for Five Guys fries (soooo addictive) or anything from Del Taco or Chick-Fil-A.   But here's what my friend and I got, as well as what I would try next time if I ever visited a WC again:   ""Cheese Sliders"": These sliders vary slightly from the ""Original"" because they include a slide of American cheese. I need cheese in my burgers ... since I take out the tomatoes and pickles, I can't really just have a slider with the burger alone. My friend and I got 2 for $3 (at least these buggers were cheap), and we saw them being mass produced--in that the thin patties were on the grill in multiples and the workers were putting everything together in true assembly-line fashion. The bun was soft and tasted fresh, which was a plus, but the patty--is that what you even call it?--was super thin ... so thin that I could hardly even taste it. It reminded me of a super thin slice of Spam. I liked the fact that the slider was really light--didn't feel heavy and bloated after eating it--but it definitely needed that cheese. I guess I was expecting the slider to be addicting/have some kind of addictive taste since it got so much hype, but that factor was lacking for me. I'm glad for the experience, but I would probably order something different next time. (Seriously, I don't know how people order packs and packs of these).   ""Bacon & Cheddar Grilled Chicken"": I would actually be interested in trying this slider because it has more elements that I like. This medley features savory grilled chicken with a zesty cheddar-cheese sauce and smoky-bacon crumbles. I do like cheese and bacon, so maybe this slider will be slightly more tasty that the ""Cheese Slider"" that I had.   ""Western BBQ Grilled Chicken"": I love BBQ flavors so this slider sounds like it's right up my alley. It features a savory, grilled chicken slider topped with smoky BBQ sauce and crispy onion rings. I do like BBQ-inspired sandwiches, so I'm down to try this slider one day.   ""Fish Sliders"": I've had fish sliders before that I really liked, so I'm willing to give the WC version a go. It features two fish sliders made with Alaska Pollock and topped with American cheese. You can even upgrade to a combo and add small fries and a soft drink. I'm not the hugest fan of soft drinks, but I would want to add fries to my order ... this is sort of like fish 'n chips, after all, but in slider form.   ""Loaded Fries"": I'm a huge fan of loaded fries, and since the WC version features fries topped with creamy ranch dressing and hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, I'd definitely want to order them some day.   ""Brownie on a Stick"": This dessert sounds really cute and seems to be a great mini indulgence. This treat on a stick features a chocolate brownie dipped in a rich, fudge coating. Brownies are one of my favorite snacks, and everything just tastes better when it's presented in a fun form ... so if I'm craving something sweet after my WC meal, I would go for this.   ""Cheesecake on a Stick"": Like its brownie counterpart, this cheesecake piece is bound to be the best little indulgence after a fast food meal. It's made with light and creamy cheesecake and dipped in a rich, fudge coating. I'm so down to try this chocolate covered cheesecake (both of these dipped dessert options were not available at the truck, so maybe I have to visit an actual WC restaurant to get it ...)   ""Bacon, Egg & Cheese Slider"": This breakfast slider sounds like one of the best ones on the WC menu. It includes freshly cracked, loosely scrambled eggs topped with American cheese and crisp, hickory-smoked bacon on a steamed signature bun. I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, so I would be willing to try this breakfast slider if I came to WC when the breakfast menu's being featured.",-1,0
"Ate at the new White Castle today because there has been so much buzz around Vegas.   I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  The food is better than McDonalds but I've had better sliders at BJ's.   Compared to In-n-Out or Five Guys, this place is waaaay down on the list of best burger joints. All you east-coasters that rave about White Castle - maybe you need to eat at a west-coast joint...",-1,0
Good burgers.  Burgers taste a little better than the frozen packs I buy at the store.  The fries are good.  I will be back.,-1,0
I don't know what to think other than I am getting old.  You either love this place or hate it. Yet I'm both.  I love it while eating it but hate it while I burp up onions all afternoon.  I like White Castle's frozen burgers back home but I love the fresh burgers on the Strip. The pickle is an extra special surprise that is not on the frozen burgers.  This may have been the last time I enjoy these burgers. I've loved them all my life but the onion burps are just too much!  (It's really bad when you know your own breath stinks!),-1,0
"White Castle Burgers has finally decided to bring their iconic sliders to the West Coast! And Las Vegas is a great place to test the waters. Hopefully with the successes and buzz the Las Vegas store is gettin. There will be more stores opening soon! In the meantime, the one in LV on the strip across from the Mirage Casino resort will do, eventhough they charge an arm n a leg for a tiny burger! I remember it used to only cost 25 cents a slider in the NYC area.",-1,0
"After hearing about White Castle for ages, I finally found myself near one in Vegas so my wife and I decided to give it a try. My fist impression is that it is a bit strange, they have a very precise process of cooking onions, burgers and buns, and it all appears very methodical. They cook on these little square griddle inserts in the counters and there are multiple little stations.  Not sure where their beef comes from, but it does look a bit unappetizing when they are laying it out in the onions, at first I thought they were putting on some sort of red square rubber spacers with holes in them so they can steam the buns with the onion aroma, but nope, those square red Lego looking things are actually the patties.  I was aware that they only offer little sliders, but I was not aware that the little sliders cost the same as a full sized burger elsewhere (1 single plain slider with nothing on it costs $1.35), they have to have huge margins here as you get basically a meatball on a roll for the price of a Big Mac. (Not that I condone eating Big Macs) We ordered the meal that came with 4 sliders (with cheese) and some fries, and also ordered 2 of their chicken ring sliders. The chicken ones were actually pretty tasty, tasted very similar to burger kings chicken sandwiches, the sort of over processed ground chicken variety. The sliders were fairly tasty and I did like the idea of eating the little thing, and though they are very basic they taste pretty good, as everything cooks in and with their caramelized onions. I did, however, need to dip the burger in ketchup to get a more deep flavor. I felt like they tasted sort of like a basic McDonald's Cheeseburger and an In-n-out ""Animal Style"" cheeseburger had a baby (so somewhere I between the quality of the 2 though much more on the McDonald's side). The Fries were also pretty good, though nothing to write home about. They are the wavy variety and not over salted.  Because the things were so small, I had the go back and order more food! This time I got 2 more chicken ring sliders and went for 2 double cheese sliders this time, which by the way are over $3 a piece! That's like the price of the ""six dollar burger"" at Carl's Jr, or the more expensive burgers at about every fast food chain, but again even the double burger is less substantial than a single ""$.99 cent menu"" burger elsewhere.  All in all we ended up spending over $30!!! Just to get full here, that is a ton for a fast food place! I really don't think I'll be back to a White Castle anytime soon, it's possible the craving could hit me when I see one because it is a unique taste, but even then, I'll likely just grab one slider to go and eat it on the way to wherever else I'm going to eat.",-1,0
"While in town visiting Vegas, I had to stop by to taste a fresh White Castle slider. When you go to their site it will list numerous of locations near me, but that is because they sell the frozen sliders. There are no White Castle locations near me so I had to try one.  As soon as I got there, there was plenty of seats and no line. It was in the afternoon when I got there. I was surprised to see they had beer there. That's cool! Beer and sliders. Great! I ordered my food and it came out quickly. Woohoo! I'm glad I came at the time I did since the place got busy as I was leaving.  I went with the cheese sliders and fries. The sliders were warm and tasty. They were so good. The bread was soft and the patty was tasty. I wasn't expecting crinkle fries for the fries. They were ok. This is a place you should try at least one.",-1,0
"No wonder this place was featured in Harold and Kumar. You would need to be drunk or stoned to enjoy White Castle.  I was so excited to try this because relatives on the east coast love White Castle. Plus Harold and Kumar made this place seem like some sort of burger godsend.   What a load of crap. Crappy bread, patties, and fries. At least they did the job and the fries weren't too salty.  But this is mediocre. In-N-Out is better.",-1,0
"It's White Castle.. It's late night munchies.Grab a bag or box of burgers get a milkshake. The power is bulk burgers, you are supposed to buy a bunch of them.  Not as good as a $10 burger? Yeah no kidding, Its a buck.   I personally hold the pickle on the cheeseburger.  The staff is great, and the lineup seems long but it does move along at a fair clip.  Now open one in LA guys...",-1,0
"Finally, I finally went to the restaurant that Harold and Kumar having to go through numerous of obstacles to just eat there. But luckily I didn't need to go through the Obstacles Harold and Kumar needs to go through lol. But I did get there at 3 am and the there's still like a 20 mins wait pretty impressive in my Opinion. Well I think the white castle slider was alrite, nothing special and crazy about it their fish white castle was pretty good I have to say. But honestly, I rather have a Mcdonald burger or an In N out burger than the White Castle with the fact that their price are pretty similar.",-1,0
"I think I was more excited about the fact that I got to finally try White Castle than I was about the actual food. My girls and I checked it out after a night of club hopping--and this food is perfect for that sort of situation. I HATE onions, but was so tired I ended up eating them anyway. The burgers weren't horrible, but they weren't amazing either. I know that folks say they're like Krystal's burgers, but I liked them better...although I couldn't tell you the last time I had anything from Krystal's.  All in all, the restaurant wasn't great, but being able to experience it during an awesome Vegas vacay made it worthwhile.",-1,0
"It is over hyped. I've heard about how amazing this place was but it's actually ok. This place isn't bad, just did not even reach anywhere near my expectations.",-1,0
It's been a few years since we had White Castle so when we found out they were opening a location in Vegas we wanted to visit.  I was little disappointed about the location. It is connected to Casino Royale and there is not much seating here. The restaurant was dirty and they didnt have any staff cleaning up the tables. The line was long but it did move fast.   The burgers didnt taste good as I remembered. Maybe because it's been a few years but I was happy to get my White Castle fix.,-1,0
"It tastes like the frozen burgers i used to buy at the grocery stores. They do come in cute boxes though, and if you get a combo, its decently priced.  Not too bad, but nothing to rave about. It's inside the Harrah's hotel.",-1,0
"White Castle?  My Wife and I were so excited to try this place and it was a major let-down.  First off the food- ok the sliders are good, not great, and definitely nothing to rave about.  The fries and mozzarella sticks are phenominal.  Why the 3 stars???  Because the price, I know its the strip but for four slides, two small fries, two small drinks, and an order of mozzarella sticks, $27!!!???? You gotta be kidding me!?  All in all i wont be back anytime soon.  Thanks for nothing Harold and Kumar.   P.S. note to management wipe down the tables and pick up trash once in awhile.  Never too busy to keep up routine cleaning...",-1,0
"I was excited to find a White Castle in Vegas mostly being from the east coast living in the west coast. The sliders were delicious and the staff were friendly. Although white castles don't have the best dinning ambiance the steamed, soft, melt in your mouth sliders is where it's at. I recommend you have the order to go to take back to your hotel as seating here is limited and kind of in a busy casino area.",-1,0
"Food wasn't that good. I spend about $50 trying different things on the menu but it just wasn't worth it. Flavorless. Employees were friendly though, so that's a plus. Harold and Kumar should have gone elsewhere!",-1,0
I like the fish sliders the best. The chicken sliders are the fries kind of dry. The cheese burgers are good I can do with out the fries...,-1,0
"To be fair, I've only had the frozen Costco version of these baby burgers and was only introduced to the chain by watching ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle."" Yup! My husband has never had WC before so we decided to give it a go.   Located at the Best Western Casino Royale, it'll hit you in the face if you're walking down the strip towards Venetian. There are security guards standing at the doors and inside to monitor the lines. We came in at 10ish and were in and out in less than an hour. Guess everyone was still sleeping. By the time we left, the line was out the door!!! About the food: -Original Slider- plain as can be. Onions, beef patty -Cheeseburger Slider- comes with a pickle, onion and cheese. I liked this one best. Had the best flavor because of the pickle.  -Chicken Ring Slider- two chicken rings with cheese. I wouldn't order it again and now understand why it needs the cheese. Without it.. Kinda dry. Fries- crinkle cut. Standard!  The boo is a fan of the cheeseburgers goodness. My beef (hehe) is that I'm not a fan of the soggy buns. Sorry! I understand it's that way because of the onions soaking the flavor into them but... I like my buns firm ;)",-1,0
"I honestly don't really see the hype about this place either. Ate here about two or three times during EDC week, because it was right next to our hotel, opened late (maybe even 24 hours?) and is cheap.  The burgers are okay, cute and little but not really flavorful. Bland I might add. Fries are okay too. The best item on their menu is probably the chicken rings, and they're not even known for that.   The employees are rude and the food doesn't really come out as fast as you would think for a fast food joint. . .  Oh Harold & Kumar, you guys definitely got my hopes up. I can see how one may find this place delicious if under the influence of marijuana.",-1,0
"It's located in castle royals, a junky little hotel...kind of gross & concerned me to it there. Food was ok, but not good enough to go out of my way to go again.",-1,0
It was good enough now it isnt in n out but in n out has about a 30-45 min wait if you are walking the strip and looking for a burger that is quick and easy and good than white castle it is and ive tried the fancy burger places and they are about the same and longer wait at those places glad to see a white castle,-1,0
"Sadly didn't live up to the hype.  I've had frozen White Castle in the past.   And who can resist coming here after watching Harold and Kumar go to White Castle :-)  Anyway it wasn't bad but left me thinking.. ""Hey McDonald's is better.""  Burgers - Good, expected them to come out hotter though since I could see them making it in front of my face.  Seems that they just serve the ones that have been sitting a bit though.  GIVE ME THE FRESH ONES! Fries - Mediocre. Chicken Ring Burger - Nah, just cheese on 2 chicken ring. Fish Burger - Okay but no condiments.. just cheese on a piece of fried fish.",-1,0
"This was my first time in a White Castle. I took the long line as a good sign. The music, videos playing, conversations, and sights made the long wait in line not so bad. Once we got our orders, we were able to find a seat, surprisingly. Burgers were cooked well. Chicken rings were crunchy.",-1,0
"This is the very 1st White Castle to have opened in the West Coast!  It opened on January 27th, 2015; and it was the very 1st time in 56 years that a White Castle has expanded in a different state.   The 1st time I ever had a White Castle slider was back in the 90's when Costco used to sell them in their freezer section.  I didn't even know that they were a fast food chain since there weren't any in the West Coast.  After Costco stopped selling these, I never heard of White Castle again until the film ""Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle"" was released in 2004.  Ever since I saw that movie, I've always had a craving for White Castle.  When I went to New York in 2008, it was the very 1st time that I ever dined at a White Castle establishment.   When I went to Las Vegas in 2015, I was pleasantly surprised to see this White Castle since they've only had their restaurants in the mid-West & the East Coast.  I had to give them a try!  This is a cleaner White Castle than their other locations, and it was fun to sit by the window and ""people-watch"" the folks walking on the strip.  As for the food.., it's your typical White Castle.  Small portions & very greasy.  You always have to order more sliders than you think, if you just have a normal appetite; and even more sliders if you're really hungry!  What makes this White Castle unique is that they serve breakfast items from 5am - 11am, and they also sell cold draft beer.   It's a good place to get cheap food at any hour of the day/night.  In the past, the only place to get 24/7 fast food was at McDonald's.  It's a novelty to finally have a White Castle in the West Coast; but at the end of all things.., it's still just a fast food chain.  It's just nice to have another alternative than the McDonald's on the Las Vegas strip.",-1,0
One of the trifecta of burger establishments and on my list it is number 3. The location jams this eatery between to other stores and makes it hard to find if not for the giant castle on the front. This is definitely a drunk food choice. Nothing better than downing as much as you can late at night when most other places are closed. A great place to experience. But maybe only experience once.,-1,0
"Came here after some cocktails in the club.   While it hit the spot, it took forever to order   I will say this - it tasted better than the one I went to in New York City - but I think it is official - there is no reason for White Castle to be as popular as it is, except that perhaps people who love it do not know S*** about food lol.",-1,0
"White Castle!  I grew up in the midwest and used to eat this sliders all the time!  Since I heard they opened up in Vegas, I was determined to come here again.  Same great taste as I remembered, but the prices in Vegas were a lot higher.  Inflation right?  Ordered some sliders at night and a crave case to go!  It's amazing you either love white castle or hate it.  I love it!i",-1,0
"White Castle is okay. I ordered the two chicken burgers meal and my friend ordered the two cheeseburgers meal. I also got ranch and honey mustard as a side and that was a good call on my part as the chicken burgers were kind of dry. The cheeseburgers tasted just like the frozen ones. The fries were okay. Basically, everything was just okay. Cheap late night drunk food. But I would go to Earls any day over White Castle.",-1,0
"White Castle finally came to the west coast, but it's certainly not the best on our coast. Everyone is curious about White Castle and what they have to offer. All we had before were the microwaveable burgers, and that certainly cannot match up to a restaurant's quality of burgers, right?   Well... White Castle is certainly good, but maybe not as good as we hoped. I would say it is slightly better in the store than it is from the frozen burgers. One view I have is that the bread and meat is not cooked long enough. If they were cooked an extra thirty seconds to a minute, it would taste much better in my opinion. The texture of the burgers are very similar to the microwaveable version, that is one thing that makes me not think it's that great. Their fries were pretty good, as well as their chicken rings, and that's what brings it up a little for me. The location isn't the greatest, but it isn't too far away from things where you have to go so far out of your way for it. It is a bit pricy in my opinion for the amount of food that you get, but what do you expect, it's the only White Castle on the west coast. It definitely is worth the experience, but not much more than that to me.",-1,0
Yummie drunk folks food! I got a 4 pc cheeseburger combo and added a slider. It was served fresh and hot!  I really enjoyed my meal here with a tingly refreshing cherry coke.  It was pretty busy but the line moved quickly!,-1,0
"I believe White Castle is slightly over-rated based on the movie ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle."" Although I do have to say it's a lot better than McDonalds. The food is cheap and the service is quick. The staff at this White Castle had a great attitude and we're very friendly.   This was my first experience at White Castle. I ordered a breakfast slider which was egg and cheese and your choice of meat. Although I did enjoy my meal it didn't live up to my expectation.   Everyone should try White Castle at least once in my opinion. So if you happen to pass it I do recommend stopping for at least one of their sliders. It's worth the experience.",-1,0
White Castle in Vegas on the strip next to Harrah's ok it's an ok place I'm not a big fan of White Castle but when you're hungry it tastes better lol. it's a small area but they are pretty fast. not much places to sit down especially when crowded. Prices are pretty high too but what do you expect for Las Vegas and on the Strip where they raise prices up. I think once to experience was good enough for me I'll stick to Lobster Me or D'Amores Pizza in PH or Secret Pizza in Cosmo for a fast lunch.,-1,0
"Being from the East Coast and now living on the Left Coast, there are some foods I just can't get. This being one of them. Prices seemed a big higher than usual, probably the Vegas tax The service was quick and the food just as I remembered. First time I've seen one of those fill up beer from the bottom machines, pretty interesting. I'm good with White Castle for at least another year!",-1,0
"White Castle on the west coast?  HELL YES...  My Harold and Kumar dreams have come true!  Located across from The Mirage, between Casino Royale and The Venetian.   Now expectations wise don't be amazed. Yeah it's good. Pay $1.39 for a 2 bite burger isn't exactly the bang for buck but it's unique and it has a history..and a movie after it!  Make sure you get cheese. My east coast fam flamed me for ordering a crave case (30) pack of original.. so don't make the same mistake.  Quite frankly it adds up to $15 or so bucks to get decently satisfied if you're a moderate eater. It'll hold up in Vegas fine. Quick service, surprisingly nice workers and decent burgers.  So go get wasted or high or both , have an epic journey throughout the Vegas strip, stop by here and earn your H&K moment.",-1,0
"TBH I only wanted to try this place out because of Harold & Kumar. Lol   Since they opened this location in Vegas, I decided to try this place out.  Location: This place is located on the strip near the Palazzo Hotel and right next to Walgreens. It's right across the street from The Mirage and Treasure Island.   Parking: You're gonna have to park at a nearby hotel and walk over if you aren't already staying at them because it is located directly on the strip.  Menu: Pretty straight forward. Original or Cheese Sliders. They serve beer on tap! How awesome is that?! Lol You can also buy meal packages, sets of 30, 100 lol  Boyfriend and I opted for 10 cheese sliders and 5 original to compare and we heard they were small.   ** TIP- You will not like these sliders if you do not like onions. I only like onions if they're cooked or caramelized or depending on my mood. I know I'm weird. Lol  I had low expectations going into this place despite reading other reviews. The cheese sliders wasn't too bad. I would eat it again. The cheese was so gooey and blended well with the onions and meat party. The original one was just too plain. The cheese definitely makes it taste 10x better. I don't recommend the original ones at all. The also come in cute little boxes.   This place would definitely be great drunk food lol but it's not amazing but it's not bad either! I just can't see myself craving it all the time.   Check this place out at least once so you can say you tried it!",-1,0
"It's just okay. Neither good nor bad. I wasn't expecting much coming here but it was worth a try. Lines can be long but once you order the food it comes out pretty fast.   The sliders were nothing to rave about... Super simple- patty, pickles (gross) & onions.  My favorite thing here were probably the onion chips. (Similar to onion rings but smaller pieces) Their chicken rings reminds me of Burger King's chicken fries.    I'd honestly need at least 3 or 4 sliders to fill up.  The menu only shows the combo prices. Sliders are $1.59 each.   If you want something different than your usual fast food joint then this place may be it. I just wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  MEHHH.",-1,0
"White Castle!!!!  I was so excited to see that a White Castle had opened up in Vegas.  I have been wanting to try it ever since Harold and Kumar.  I already knew going in that I was probably not going to be blown away by White castle.  I had tried the microwavable ones and they were okay.  It is fast food and sliders, so I was not expecting gourmet or even In N Out status.  I was just excited to try it just for the sake of saying I had it before.    It is open 24 hours and located inside the Casino Royale.  We were staying at the Venetian which was just a short walk away.  The line was pretty long when we got there but it moved pretty quickly.  Their menu mostly concentrates on their sliders and they have a few slider combinations that you can get.  We decided on 10 sliders with cheese and a side of onion slices.  Each slider comes in a square box and has chopped onions and a pickle inside.  We got our order pretty quickly and headed back to the Venetian to enjoy our food.  The people working there are really nice and good natured.  They were having fun at their jobs and our cashier had a good personality.    I read a lot of people complaining about the size and relative price of the burgers.  It is a slider, that is what they are known for and it is fast food AND it is Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is like a dollar or so more in pricing when compared to another city where tourism is not so heavily relied upon.  Seriously though, lower your expectations a bit beforehand and you should be good.   Despite thier small size, those things pack quite a punch because of the buns.  I got full after eating about 4 of them.  The first one I ate, I thought was really good.  The onions, cheddar cheese, soft bun and thin patty came together perfectly.  I did not even mind the pickle in there and I usually hate pickles.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first one.  By the third and fourth one, I was enjoying then less and less.  If you have had the microwavable ones, then you have pretty much tasted what they taste like.  They taste exactly like the microwavable boxed ones except just a tiny bit better.  The onion chips were really good.  I would definately recommend that if you like onions.  The breading is crunchy and thick.  We ended up having two sliders left over and I ate one at like 5 am when we got back from the club.  Still pretty good, but the bun got really hard.    I enjoyed my sliders but then again I came in with low expectations.  If you are not from the midwest or east coast and you just happen to be in Vegas, I would definately give it a shot.  It is open 24 hours anyways.  I do not think I would crave them but I would get it again if it were convenient.",-1,0
"Been wanting to try this place since everyone keeps talking about it. Came on the day of Christmas and it was packed but we managed to get a table and came before the rush. Ordered the fish slider, chicken slider, and the regular beef slider. The sliders were good but the portion were so tiny compared to photos..I enjoyed it but it was gone before I knew it..took like 3 bites and it's gone. I wish the patty was slightly bigger, it was quite thin I almost missed it. The fish slider was delicious and super soft. The chicken slider was probably best out of all 3 for me. Please increase your portion!",-1,0
"They are considered a east coast institution but they tasted like McDonalds Cheeseburgers to me. I think its the combination of pickles and onions and thin meat on a soft bun.  Would I try again, why not but I wouldn't expect outstanding at all.   Onion strips were okay. Staff was polite and kind and had me on my way with combo #2 in no time (4 cheeseburgers, onions or fries plus drink).  Place is located on the east wall of the Casino Royale which I think they took some space from a Denny's that use to be there or might still be there.   Security is there to keep people from cutting a very long line.  My experience was walking in and was asked by a guard if I just got there, I said yes and then he asked me to get in line but there was no long line, I asked him which line? He then said oh, another guard just said go ahead sir. Line was actually 5 deep at the time and not out the door to the strip like some mentioned.",-1,0
"I've been to Krystal burger several times, so was excited to finally be able to compare them to White Castle (never having the opportunity to try White Castle except for frozen version). I think it hits the spot if you're drunk. And the buns are more fluffy than their frozen counterparts when fresh. So overall it's worth a go to see what Harold and Kumar were all about. Like it or hate it, it's cool that it exists on the west coast now.",-1,0
"It's OK.  Nothing special. But I would get the novelty of this place because it was on the movie ""Harold and Kumar"" Lol. Burgers are $1.99 and 4 pack combos are around $7.99 not bad. For a quick late night snack it's definitely a good place to go if nothing is open.",-1,0
Waited in line for about an hour and a half but it was worth it. We ordered 20 burgers added cheese to half of them and it came with 2 Fries. Also added a 6 pc chicken rings and soda and total came out to $37!  The fries were nothing special and I won't get them again and the chicken rings were alright. Nothing special either. Burgers of course were delicious and we took half of them home and warmed the rest up for dinner. Only complaint is the prices!! They should be charging the same that they do at all there east coast locations not jacking the price up cause it's on the strip. Hope they get the jalapeÃ±o burgers soon cause those are the best!  I also like to say it cracks me up how people Compare this to in n out!!! There is no comparison what so ever so stop comparing. There's actually not a single fast food or burger joint U can compare to White Castle.,-1,0
do not eat if your diet lately has been healthy. your stomach gonna hurt real bad. other then that classic drunk food. mini burgers fries and a cherry coke.,-1,0
"Great place for a late night snack after a party hardy night on the Strip. Space is a bit cramped but food is up to par. Service was fairly quick, got our ""Sack"" of 10 sliders within 10 minutes.",-1,0
Heard the menu selection in Chicago is bigger and offers Jalepeno burger. Burgers are not very much different from the Frozen White Castle in your local stores.,-1,0
"Oh White Castle! Even though I never watched the Harold and Kumar movie before, I have heard about the sliders from White Castle and I couldn't wait to try one. Luckily, this fast food restaurant was open 24/7 so after a night of clubbing, my friend and I headed over to this place for a quick meal. There was definitely no lines on a Tuesday morning around 4am, and I quickly ordered one original slider ($1.29) and one chicken ring slider ($1.99) to try. The cashier proudly told me he had 15 chicken rings for lunch when I seemed hesitant in trying the chicken ring slider. I was definitely not hungry enough for 15 chicken sliders, but you do you boo. However, props to the cashier working on this 4am shift!   When I received my sliders, I was quite surprised at how tiny these sliders looked. They were about the size of my palms and I'm pretty sure I can eat the slider in one bite if I tried hard enough. Taste wise- they were both okay. They were not mind-blowing and I don't see myself craving these sliders in the future. They actually tasted a bit plain to me, since there was no special sauce included in the beef or chicken slider. I guess this a good place to grab a quick bite if you are on a budget since the prices were more reasonable than other restaurants on the strip. I can't say I won't ever be back, but probably not in the near future.",-1,0
"The food was okay. The burgers were a little thin for me and needed some flavor-- I would get them with cheese, next time. But, I would give whom I think is the manager (we were there around 12 noon on June 1, 2015) the extra star for his skills, he was working hard along side his workers, kept his cool with his employees, and I don't know how he does it, but he even ran up to the front to call a customer back to ask if they needed condiments because he noticed that his employee forgot to ask them if they needed some.",-1,0
"Ugh... I'm being generous with that third star... but whatever.  I grew up on microwaved White Castles... and my first time having them in person... they're honestly not bad.  Better than the microwave version, but not by much.  That pickle they put on there is just right for the flavor.  They're nothing special though.  What gets me is that they're pretty pricey for what they are...  I wouldn't seek them out again, but, if I was walking the strip and had the munchies while walking by, I'd certainly grab em.",-1,0
"Three stars here because I love White Castle but not at the prices that exist at this location. I grew up in Ohio so White Castle was always around. It was a very cheap and fast way. Here in Vegas however, prices are doubled which quickly makes this place not worth going to. I love White Castle but not $10+ much.",-1,0
"So, once I found out they opened a White Castle in Vegas, I knew I had to try it on my upcoming trip.  On our last night there, we took the Deuce down to Casino Royale (between Harrah's and the Venetian) to see what all the hype was all about.  I had heard the lines could get crazy, but luckily it was only minimally busy (Tuesday night) and the wait was short.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the hamburger.  :(   My sister-in-law tried the Chicken Ring burger and liked it, so I may consider trying that next time...  I'm glad I tried it, but not sure if I would go again.",-1,0
"My boyfriend & I have been waiting since our last Vegas trip for this to open!  Finally, a White Castle for us to try that is not frozen!  We ordered:  #7 - 10 original sliders (add cheese), 2 regular soft drinks, 2 regular French fries (one of them = cheese fries).  It sounds like a lot, but for 2 really hungry people, it is a cake to finish because the sliders are small.  Each slider comes with onions & pickles (I did not realize this until I took my first bite -__-)  The food is good & it is a perfect drunk meal for when you are finished clubbing because it open 24/7! Fudge-dipped Cheesecake - Nothing extraordinary.  Customer service could have been better.  Several of us were looking at the menu & deciding & the cashiers kept on asking if we were ready.  Also, considering how much food my boyfriend & I ordered, they only gave us 3 ketchups...  My boyfriend went back to ask for more & the workers gave him 2, then I went back to ask for more & I got 3.  Pretty shady!",-1,0
"I've always wanted to try White Castle burgers made fresh from their actual restaurant. My experience with them to this point had been buying their frozen burgers they sell across the country in most grocery stores (which I really enjoy).   I have to say that there wasn't much difference between the fresh restaurant product and the frozen product. I even think that I am slightly fonder of the frozen one. Also the added benefit of there being no drunk people stumbling around the freezer section of your local Walmart gives getting the frozen burgers a leg up on visiting this location which is in the middle of the Casino Royale (a fun but slightly shady casino on the north end of the strip).   Burgers were okay, fries were okayish, and prices were average. White Castle ended up being a luke warm purgatory like experience.",-1,0
"I had biznass nearby, so I figured I might as well finally try to come here. Although it was a decent fast food option, I'm definitely glad I didn't make this place a destination on its own. $9 for a combo meal is overpriced IMO, but hey, it's on the strip, so I'm guessing the prices are a little inflated. I usually avoid this area like the plague, so I doubt I'll come again any time soon.",-1,0
"Been drinking and playing all day and night...quick you need food stat! White castle is that quick food you just may need. Get the grease to line your stomach and cure that hangover. While white castle isn't the best food in Vegas, it is cheap, quick and gets the job done. Good fast food and would visit this place again. The staff took my order, got my food and got me out the door, can't really ask for more.",-1,0
"Finally decided to try the White Castle on the strip. There sure is a lot of people standing around doing nothing on shift. There's about 20 employees behind the counter together yet maybe only five or so are actually working. No wonder the line is out the  door, not because their busy but because they have employees standing around aimlessly chit chatting instead of working. Hmmmm a lot of unhappy customers in line.",-1,0
"White Castle.   I'm from the east coast, so I've had WC before, and I was pretty excited they were opening on the strip.   I found myself on the strip at 5:45 am, less than 16 hours after the grand opening and judging by the line I figured this may be my only shot to ever eat here.   Even at 6 am it was pretty packed. I only ordered 2 sliders and onion chips and waited for my food. And waited for my food. And...  See, the issue is, there's always going to be some yahoos getting a crave case or a crave crate (100) that is going to hold up the line. I also saw people getting their food before me that ordered after me, and my order was quite small.   Pros:   It tastes exactly like the White Castle you have grown to love.   Cons:  The price is a bit higher than your typical standalone WC.   The wait is always going to be outrageous.   The back of the house is absolutely filthy. Like, worse than Waffle House.   If you've got the time, and you want some White Castle, have at it. I'm not sure I'll be back.   Three *** - Only because I knew what I was getting into.",-1,0
"White Castle is located inside Casino Royale.  I wish it was sectioned off better.  You can really smell the smoke when you are eating.   It was nice to finally try White Castle, since there are none near me.  The burgers are pretty small.  I liked how the burger bun was really soft.   We also ordered the fries, which are crinkle cut.    Overall, there are a few tables inside for customers to enjoy their food.  Its a good place to grab a quick snack.",-1,0
"One word: overrated!   This place is not even in the same ballpark as some of the great burger joints! Came here with high expectations due to:  1) Everyone ranting and raving about how great the burgers are 2) It's renowned reputation in the East Coast 3) they made a movie about how amazing it is!   Always wanted to try it after watching Harold and Kumar so naturally when I had a chance to dig into a pack of these ""amazing burgers"" during my last trip to Vegas, how could I not???   Although the service was great, the staff worked hard & fast, and the restaurant was constantly being cleaned (thus the 3 stars), the burgers were just OK and left something to be desired. They were mini burgers with paper thin meat that you could hardly taste and bread that was somewhat soggy due to the pickles/onions. it was a huge let down when I took my first bite. I immediately regretted being overly excited and buying a whole pack of these mediocre burgers! My husband and I didn't get through our pack of burgers and ended up throwing them away knowing we weren't going to eat them later.   Huge disappointment!  :(",-1,0
"It is late night, hangover food. The sliders are squishy in texture. The fries are fast food fries. It isn't bad, but it won't make your tastebuds sing either. It's a cheap meal when you are hungry and broke on the strip.",-1,0
"The three stars is mainly for the employees working here, they are super nice.   This is my first time trying White Castle and I really wanted to see what the hype was all about, but I was so disappointed. The beef patty is so thin you are basically eating steamed buns with pickles and cheese. The onion fries I got tasted how I expected it to taste, basically cut up onion rings. Glad I finally got to try this after so many years, but basically one and done for me.",-1,0
"Every time I see this place, I think about Harold & Kumar go to White Castle. Although I've seen and passed by this place every year for the past several years, I finally decided to come in and try the place in February. I actually walked from The Excalibur here and walked back. In a way, it was my own White Castle adventure. I was able to snag a coupon from a guy about a block down and that really sealed the deal. The restaurant was pretty packed, there were absolutely no seats available, but the line was very short when I got in.  I got the 4pk cheese sliders with a drink and fries for about 9 bucks before the coupon. I was kind of expecting the prices I heard in the movie, but I'm thinking since this is Vegas and on the strip, everything is like 50-100% more. Food came out within about 5mins, and I took it to go and ate at the fountain right in front of In N Out. If you ask why I didn't just go to In N' Out, it's because I have one close to home, so I wanted something I can't get back home. The burgers themselves actually didn't look very appealing. The meat kind of looks like spam (not that I have anything against spam). I have had the frozen ones before and those looked better. As for the taste, it wasn't bad. Typical fast-food burger taste, but the little chopped grilled onions add a lot of flavor. I was pretty full after eating all 4 of the sliders. I would probably come back again if I had a longer stay in Vegas. If I'm only here just a few days, I would probably rather have something a bit nicer. The only exception is that my brother is pretty crazy about these, so if he ever comes along on one of my trips to Vegas, I'll bring him here so he can try to eat 20 of these lol.",-1,0
Came here for an early lunch. I think it was 10:30 am when we got here.   This White Castle is located on the strip near Venetian hotel and casino. Hubby wanted to come here.   I was not impressed but super hungry. I got a number 2 which consisted of 4 small White Castle cheeseburgers with crinkle cut fries and a drink. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries. I had a raspberry iced tea. The burgers were filled with cheese and pickles. I don't like pickles in our burgers. I think this place gets too much hype. Place had refill Coke soda station like the old school fountains. Descent place to eat.   The guy at the register was super nice. The guy calls your number when your food is ready. You basically dump your own trash. There is plenty of seating. At least I got to try this place once.,-1,0
"I don't know what to say about White Castle sliders...  Realistically speaking, there shouldn't be any reason why a slider from White Castle should be appealing: (1) cheap, soft, over processed rolls which are reminiscent of what you can expect from the buffet at Pondegrossa, (2) over-cooked, greasy patty cut in a ridiculous, bite-sized 2x2 inch square, (3) a diced and sliced mixture of onions and pickles that are better suited for a hot dog or a stupid, McDonald's hamburger...  ...And yet, they're surprisingly good.  They have the faintest philly cheesesteak aspect to them that I find irresistible.  And unlike a cheesesteak, which has sliced rib eye steak, a White Castle slider can't be nearly as expensive to replicate that flavor.  I'd say they're on to something, but then again they've been doing this for a while.  After all, some movie director even made a movie with the White Castle name on it which forever immortalized it in the bong-resin charred brains of stoners everywhere.  As far as I'm concerned, I only seem to dip into a White Castle every decade or so, but I was pleased to see that they have all kinds of different sliders these days: chicken sliders, jalapeno sliders, fish sliders, etc.    Maybe next time I'll get a double cheese slider and a bacon & cheddar grilled chicken slider.  Who knows?  It might get really weird.",-1,0
I was amped up to come here mainly because of the movie and also I've only ever had the frozen burgers. I was also curious what else White Castle had to offer other than the obvious. I had chicken rings which were basically like chicken nuggets with a hole in the middle. The burgers tasted pretty close to the flavor I've experienced with the frozen kind. I don't know if that speaks to White Castle's ability to freeze and recreate in the microwave or what. It's okay. Wouldn't make the trip to this part of the strip specifically for White Castle but wouldn't object if I was part of a group who all wanted to eat there.,-1,0
"I feel silly reviewing the actual burger - surely it's something you've had before and can't we all just agree Krystal has vastly superior cheap sliders ? The burger itself isn't anything special and clearly it has to be a nostalgic thing for you to actually enjoy eating them (how brainwashed are you Midwestern people?). That being said my pregnant self wanted a slider for a snack at 10 AM and this place delivered. There was no wait at 10:00 AM (surprise surprise) and the food was cheap (for the strip) and came out very quickly (maybe 3 mintues?). The place was clean, not overly crowded and a nice fast snack option for when you're roaming the strip.",-1,0
"Fries were good, but the burgers were just any old burger slapped together but just made mini.",-1,0
"This probably deserves a 4-star rating given most people's expectations, so let me clarify before I get into the review: I have no real qualms about this place besides the price. The burgers are nearly as good as those in the Midwest.  So, the GOOD:  - Burgers are nearly as good as the Midwest - They give you as many ketchup packets as you want (you probably need to ask if you want any at all) - The place seemed clean enough during a busy night around 1 in the morning - The wait wasn't bad, for the ordering line or for the pickup line  The BAD:  - The main thing is the price. It shouldn't be more than a dollar per burger, and obviously buying more burgers should give you some sort of deal. But it's (as of April 2016) $35.99 for a crave case (30 plain sliders), which is almost the exact same price as 30 individual sliders. Likewise, it costs 30 cents to add cheese to a slider. If you add cheese to all 30 sliders, you might expect some deal. Nope. 30 cents times 30 slices of cheese is 9 dollars, which is the exact amount you'll have to add to your price if you want 30 sliders with cheese instead of regular sliders. That means you're paying $44.99 for 30 tiny sliders...and that's before taxes.  Look, I know it's the Vegas strip, so I don't really mind the price that much. Everything's more expensive, and the constant stream of customers proves they're asking a fair market price. Still, I'm taking away a star because that's just way too much money for those tiny burgers. It costs the same amount for 30 tiny sliders as for like 30 full size McDoubles.  - The burgers aren't quite as good as in the Midwest. They're still good -- they'll satisfy if you're a White Castle fan like myself -- but they're just slightly lacking. I think the problem is that they use this large island grill where something like 4 people work at once, and that open setup results in the steam escaping. For those who don't know, part of the magic of White Castle is that the burgers are cooked by steaming them over a bed of onions. So that onion flavor permeates the entire burger and bun. But with the Vegas location setup, I think the steam doesn't do it's job. Which also results in less moist buns.  But don't let this sway you from going here. Still very good.  - The staff wasn't all that friendly. Not that they were rude. When I asked for ketchup, the guy gave me plenty of ketchup, but didn't even look at me as he was serving me. The people on the grill looked a bit miserable. That's understandable, given they probably spend their day making millions of sliders non-stop because this is a hugely busy location. The girl taking orders was neither friendly nor unfriendly.  - The menu is a bit poorly done. The cheese options, for instance, are listed as a footnote at the top (are those still called footnotes?) where it mentions that you can add cheese or jalapeno cheese. For those unfamiliar with the White Castle menu, they'll probably just miss that option entirely.  - It's WAY at the end of the strip (that is, the part furthest from the 15 freeway). Not as far as Trump Hotel, but past the Venetian. So if you're down near Excalibur, or even the Cosmopolitan, you've got a long walk ahead of you. Might be better to drive to closer hotel and walk. Harrah's parking is free and easy to access off the strip (not sure about other hotels -- do your own research).  SUMMARY:  Go here. It's good.  So why the low rating? I'm taking off two stars because of 1) price and 2) not having the service or taste that lives up to the Midwest experience. But it's still quite good -- I just can't justify mathematically giving it 5 stars because 5 stars would be the standard White Castle experience, which this misses. But going here was still awesome.  PRO TIP: White Castles are excellent breakfast food. Let them sit overnight -- keep the burger cases overlapping to trap the moisture in! -- then let them sit out overnight and enjoy the next day.  Always consume with ketchup.  HELPFUL INFO for the uninitiated:  White Castle sliders are tiny and come standard with chopped, slightly grilled onion, and a pickle. No mustard or ketchup. You have to ask for ketchup packets if you want, but it's easier to bring your own bottle so you don't spend your meal opening and squeezing out 30 packets.  For guys with a young appetite, you could easily consume 10 sliders. Something like 6 might be enough for you.  Women and girls with lesser appetites might be satisfied with 2-4 sliders.  Don't forget to try out their other stuff, like jalapeno cheese, onion rings, etc. It's all good stuff.",-1,0
"I felt like I had to try it since it's so well known, talked about, and movie about it. I never make it to the east coast and now that there is one in Vegas, I had to try it. So far I've only had the frozen ones which are just ""ok"". Well unfortunately it tasted the same as frozen. Guess that says how good of a job they did with the frozen burgers, but also about how ""meh"" the burger is. I'd imagine the prices are a lot higher at the Vegas location than ones on the east coast, at least I hope so for there sake. They had combos with 2 or 3 sliders and the things are so tiny I wouldn't be surprised if people easily take down 10. I got a single, a double, then split some onion rings (although they werent rings, what? they qere quarters) and chicken rings (which actually were rings). There is way better food on the strip, especially for burgers, but if you go here, I suggest just trying it for a drunking snack, not for a real meal.",-1,0
"So when I heard this famous east coast fast food burger joint was coming to Vegas, I was really hyped! But when we got there it was met with disappointment! The burgers tasted exactly like they came out of the frozen food section. I mean if that's how it's suppose to taste, that's fine but I was disappointed. It was nice to finally eat at this world famous joint but wasn't impressed. The chicken rings and onion chips were pretty good and that's why it's an average (3 star) rating. The wait was nonexistent. We walked right in and ordered (we went in on a Wednesday around 11am). We found it easiest to get there by parking at the Venetian and walking towards the strip and hanging a left.",-1,0
One of few locations west of the Mississippi. This is located in the middle of the strip. Visited early in the morning. Wanted to order beef and chicken White Castle burgers.  Offerings in the morning were fresh beef off the grill and what seemed like fairly older sitting chicken. We held off on chicken. Ordered 10 beef White Castle burgers. Onions with the mini patty burgers on buns. The burgers stayed warm for a good two hours. The fresh version of these burgers are similar to the frozen one in grocery stores.  Service was quick. Burgers are okay.,-1,0

"White Castle located inside The Casino Royal. Came to visit from Los Angles and saw there was a White Castle on the strip. Naturally,  we went to get stoned and came to grub.  The burgers tasted just like the frozen ones you buy at the store. Nothing extra,  nothing special. The experience was good and the woman that attended us was cheerful so it was cool over all.... I'd come back again, why not.",-1,0
"Highly disappointed. I have been eating the frozen white castle burgers ever since I was a kid so I was super excited to finally try it unfrozen. I still liked it, however it tastes exactly the same as the frozen ones. Next time i'm gonna drive/walk the extra miles to go to shake shack because those burgers are 10x better!",-1,0
"I am from California  and Im super interested about White Castle's food. The tiny little burgers were alright and the onion fries were delicious! Overall it was a good experience, but there are many more burger places that surpass this place. I would like to mention that the staff here are excellent, the cashier helped us out choosing food since we didnt know what to get and was very kind and sweet. I dont remember his name, but we really appreciated his help!",-1,0
"I give them 3 stars because the food is to my liking; however, there are a few things that I don't like about this place... 1). You have to park at a hotel and walk through the casino to get out to the strip to do some more walking just to get to the place. (walking I don't mind so much, good exercise - trying to keep a positive mindset especially if you're eating junk food lol) 2). When you do finally get there, you have to wait in line and depending on when the tables are cleared/available and how many people you have with you (besides how packed they are) will determine how long you wait until you get inside - only to have to wait in another line to order your food. 3). They dont have an extras section on the menu - for example if you want to add an extra slider to your combo.  4). If you're sitting by the door of the entrance to the place, during the Volcano show at the Mirage hotel across the street, you can feel the heat blowing at you when the door is open. (Im not a fan of heat; and yes Im aware I live in Vegas lol) ***Lastly, I hope they open more locations so for some of us locals who tend to avoid the strip wont have to go to there. As good as the food was, the traffic on the strip, parking at the hotel, and dealing with all the tourists is enough to keep me away.",-1,0
Decided to take a bunch home for my son and nephew. Haven't had these lil gems since I lived back East and now that the lines have gone down figured why not. Lil pricey to feed 3 persons and to be honest not as tasty as I remember them to be. Not much difference from the frozen ones at the grocery store. Ok if you're in the area otherwise I wouldn't make a special stop.,-1,0
"It's White Castle!!!  After moving out of Michigan White Castle is hard to come by, besides frozen and those are just not right!  This curbed the ""crave"" while being in Las Vegas. Yes, the prices are higher...it's Vegas!! The lady behind the register was lovely, polite, and patient while we got our order together. The food was served quickly.....not usually the case at most White Castles! Burgers were what we expected but the chicken was full of grizzle and had me very dissatisfied in that department. Yes, it was dirty and the drink station a mess but there was a worker cleaning. I chalked that up as that they were busy. Management probably needs to put someone in the seating area cleaning at all times just to keep up on the traffic and mess!  Would I go back....if in Vegas again.... Well Yes.....It's White Castles!!!",-1,0
"As far as my first White Castle experience goes...I don't remember much of it. It's conveniently located on the strip to catch all the intoxicated folk walking by.   It was pretty decent food, but I wasn't expecting the sliders to hold a thin sandwich like meat instead of an actual patty. Also, the fries were a bit too crispy for my liking.  On the other hand, the service was pretty quick and I can't complain about what I ate after leaving the club--I was full at the end of the night, and that's really all the matters at the end of the that kind of night.",-1,0
"First time ever at a white castle. Was pretty average. It was busy, but what do you expect on the strip. Burgers were good to soak up the booze at the end of the night. Would go again because the price is right for were it's located. Just expect to wait in line for awhile.",-1,0
"I'm not a big fan of fast food, it's so unhealthy for you. When you're hungry and have limited options then maybe. If you're walking the strip, you're been drinking and hungry then White Castle is a must! It's a newer spot on my way back to my hotel so I figured, why not? What you eat in Vegas, stays in Vegas.   Since it's only sliders, I ordered a variety so that I can get my White Castle fix. My favorite was the JalapeÃ±o Cheese Sliders. It wasn't spicy at all just in case you don't like spicy foods. The patty on the sliders are very thin and I recommend getting the doubles. White Castle has a nice twist of an onion ring with their Onion Chips. It wasn't bad and complimented the sliders well.   The staff here is what you expect from a fast food restaurant but the customers are interesting. It ranges from the very drunk, drunk, families to completely sober people. Luckily they have ample tables and seating in their dining area. It could be cleaner but you have to option to take out. For me, I'm glad this experience stayed in Vegas.",-1,0
Disappointed I thought it would be way better then the microwavable Frozen ones... taste the same,-1,0
"Having never been to the east coast, I wanted to give these guys a whirl. $8.99 got me 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a soda. I scarfed those bad boys down and thought they weren't half bad. Couple days later I got the 2 dbl chs w fries and soda for $7.99 but thought the middle bun was too squishy and unnecessary. Not much of a line, pretty quick service, what could be better?",-1,0
"This White Castle seems to be more expensive than in Chicago but I guess we're paying for convenience. It was clean and nice and you can watch your food being prepared. The food didn't really stand out as it was fast food overall, but I'd come again if I was craving their famous sliders. FYI it is $1.29 for each burger slider and you'll want to eat a couple as they aren't that filling.",-1,0
"I used to hear my friend talk about eating at White Castle. He was so hype about it. So once I saw this, I had to go try it. Service was great. Food was prepared quick. I ordered the double slider, cheese slider, and a fish slider. Size is your typical small slider size; smaller than a McDonalds. The food was just plain. Your bun, cheese, meat, pickles, onions? and that's it. If there was sauce, I couldn't taste it. Good thing they offered condiments like ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, zesty sauce, hot sauce, etc. Mayo went well with the fish slider I got. Honey mustard went well with the double slider. All in all, I was a little disappointed in the taste. I don't want to have to add my own sauce... Well, at least I tried it...",-1,0
"Average place to get a burger...... a slider, it's your classic New Yorker feel. Grab yourself a six pack and roam the strip!",-1,0
Nothing special about White Castle burgers. It was very pricey for small simple cube-shape burgers. It was worth the try but something I wouldn't eat again. We ordered number 7 with cheese for extra $3. The late night crowd is not a pleasant so I recommend anyone with little kids to go somewhere else.,-1,0
"White Castle has always been on my bucket list, thanks to Harold and Kumar.  Last time my family and I visited Las Vegas, my brothers went and raved so much about the place. So we just went and honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about the place. The burgers itself were kind of dry but I really did like the grilled onions in it. I just think if there was some sort of sauce in the burgers, it would've been much better. I was expecting much more.  However, the price wasn't that bad. We got the combo with 20 burgers and two fries and it cost $25. So that wasn't bad at all.  Overall, I'm glad I got to go to the place for the experience but I'm not keen on going back anytime soon.",-1,0
"I understand they have just branched out to the west coast. Buuuuut.... This is not a ""full"" White Castle menu. No fish sandwiches. The only reason I eat there. I hope to see more options next time I'm in Vegas. For now I will travel back home to NJ for my White Castle fix.",-1,0
"I've been coming here since I found out about this place! And I love the burgers and the mozzarella sticks. I love coming here because they're always so friendly. The only thing I didn't like this time was that the table were super dirty. Another thing was that there was an employee fighting with a guest telling him to leave. The manager came and told the guy to leave and he said ok. And then then the employee left and came back and started telling the guy inappropriate stuff. That was unnecessary drama, but I still love the burgers !",-1,0
All HYPE!  I was walking the strip and happen to walk past a sign that said White Castle. I look up and behold its a White Castle restaurant. I immediately walk inside. Take a look at the menu. All I see is these mini burgers. Anyways i went and ordered a combo. 4 small mini burgers fries and a drink. Service was fast. Line got back up but they are quick. Got my food. Had to find a spot to eat since the whole place was pack. This location is a gold mine for white castle. All the tourist walking by get lured in.   Burgers was okay. Fries was generic. All this hype for some small burgers made famous by a movie.   Give it a try. Only will try once again if a friend choose to eat here.   Nothing special! Move along!,-1,0
Buns seem to be steamed better than when I first came. Still disappointed with not having onion rings and clam strips on the menu.,-1,0
Came in at 7 am and there werent a lot of customers yet but my cousins and I are were very excited nontheless! Workers were very nice and sweet considering it was super early! Very quaint and clean environment! The portions are a bit tiny so you are gonna want more! Overall I loved it! I will be coming back!!,-1,0
"We loved the very thin patties and super soft bread.  Definitely not for those who like a meaty patty.  Clean for being so busy.  Great place for a fast food snack.  I didn't like the ranch dressing, but I'm pretty particular about that.",-1,0
"Tried White Castle for the first time at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest and thought they were decent. I think there was more hype about how great they were that made me want to give it a try.   When I heard about White Castle opening in Vegas I thought I should try it from the real place instead of a food truck. So I went with a friend opening day. The line wrapped around the building. We waited for about an hour and a half but moved pretty fast considering the line of people. While waiting it was nice to see some of the staff coming out to talk to us and we're so enthusiastic about opening.   When we finally got to the front I had to try one of everything. Almost everything. We got the original sliders , fries, loaded fries and chicken rings. Once we had the food to ourselves we indulged. Loved the chicken rings and who doesn't love fries. The loaded fries tasted good but I could have done without the bacon,sadly it didn't taste like good crispy bacon we all love. Annnnnd then the sliders...they tasted just as I remembered from the foodie fest. Luke warm and wet, almost soggy bread.  I'm an optimist so I do wanna go back and try it again and hope it was only like that due to the craziness of opening day. If not, definitely munchie or drunk food.   P.S. Get a beer! The way they serve it is pretty awesome.",-1,0
"So yeah.  White Castle.  Uhm it's a thing here now.  Honestly it has been a thing here for about a decade.  I say this because it tastes exactly the same as the frozen microwave burgers.  Exactly? Well not really because there is a pickle in these ones.    The location is on the strip in the small casino north of the Venetian by the Linq parking lot. It's very fast paced and as soon as we ordered we weren't able to fill up our drinks halfway before our order of 20 cheese sliders, 9 piece chicken rings, onion chips and fries were done.    To say the least it was not the most rewarding way for me to break my pescetarian seafood diet.  At best it could be said that you could enjoy the satisfaction that us West coasters can now join the likes of dining in an East coast fast food institution.  Not as rewarding as the opposite experience is for East coasters trying a Double Double & Animal Style Fries from In & Out for the first time.    We got hugely full sharing a 10 pack of sliders for 2 and the baby loved the chicken rings though.  We brought the second 10 pack home for my little bro.  Sadly he had to microwave them slightly by then.  Completely rehashing the same old feeling of eating them the frozen way.  He noted that it was cheaper and more convenient to have just got them at the freezer section.  They may even use the exact ingredients at the restaurant?  It was fun.  Everyone should try it at least once.  I may rather stick to a grilled cheese w/ grilled onions with Animal Style fries & a 7up next time without the strip traffic though.",-1,0
"From 7/24/15  We came here after a concert, and let me just say this White Castle is not like the ones I am used to in NY. Now, taking in account this location is on The Strip, I had to remind myself not to pick it apart for being overcrowded after all there are tons of hungry tourist to feed.  Once you get your burgers, it's typical White Castle- cheap and delicious. I just hope they make one off The Strip for those of us who just want their burger goodness minus all the tourist.",-1,0
"After hearing about White Castle since Harold and Kumar made it a thing, I was happy to learn there was one within reach in Vegas. After deciding to plan a mini-vacation to Vegas, my boyfriend's only request was to come here, so we did. Maybe this is one of those 'this is so good' when you're drunk type of places, because we just thought- meh. A solid ""it's okay""-3 stars but nothing to text home about.",-1,0
"Tucked in the heart of Las Vegas Boulevard at the Casino Royale is a White Castle. Although prices were a little higher than other White Castles, it was a welcome price break from the more spendy food options on the Strip.  The lines were long, but what other White Castle can you also buy beer?   Enjoy the signature steamed square burger sliders, strongly flavored with chopped white onion. We particularly liked the fish slider which I thought was a cut above McDonald's Filet-O-Fish. The crinkle fries were okay. 'Try the crunchy onion bits. Although it isn't fancy, White Castle sliders hit the spot when you need a bite when you are on a tight budget.",-1,0
"Growing up in the West, I've never really gotten to experience White Castle fresh. I've only experienced the frozen kind that you buy at your local markets. With that said, and with rave reviews of friends and family, my experience here was anti climatic. I'll have to admit that the fresh ones were slightly better than the frozen one you make at home. These famous sliders are steamed on a bed of grilled onions with a very thin slice of hamburger,  (And I mean thin. I suppose so that it could cook faster) and topped with a bun to also steam. If you want cheese, that is extra. Your slider also contains a pickle. If you want double meat that would be extra as well. I had order the cheese slider combo. It came with 4 sliders, fries or onion chips, and a drink. This cost about $9. Prices are a bit high for what you are receiving. That is to be expected considering it is on the Las Vegas Strip. It's always busy and within one of the casino in Vegas.",-1,0
"It's not gourmet food, but it IS a White Castle out here in the southwestern US!  For pure nostalgia and novelty it gets at least 3 stars.  The food is just how I remember it last time I had it driving through New Jersey.  I got the yummy crinkle fries and those cheese sliders kissed with onion steam.  Mmmm.  The line went pretty quickly, and the cashier was friendly.  Love the castle facade on the Strip!  It's connected to the Best Western/Casino Royale's food court, which let's face it, is not the most stellar hotel/casino out here.  I did go out of my way just for this food, but it was worth it to me.  Again, just the fact that it's out here is worth a lot.  Now I only have to drive 5 hours, not fly across the country, if I ever get another craving.  :)",-1,0
"Not sure if lackluster taste or just sober.  I've gone to White Castle locations in the East Coast a few years back and remember tasting the sweetness of caramelized onions with that salty square patty and having a huge smile on my face from the first slider to the last. This time around... not so much.  Granted it is a fast food chain and not much should be expected but nonetheless I'm voicing a little disappointment. I'm sure after knocking a few back through the night this place would have been a godsend but not when I'm sober and chauffeuring people from out of town trying to explain that this chain had a whole movie revolving around it.   The sliders do come somewhat neatly packed into their signature boxes and it's always a fun time when you take 20 of them to make a nice castle to DESTROY. We opted for half regular and half with cheese for this order.   Fries were under-seasoned and kind of took me back to the days of my childhood eating cafeteria food... you know what... let's just call this experience that.  Having White Castle on the Las Vegas strip in the early evening is like over-paying for the same $2.50 slider and fry combo you would buy at your school cafeteria during lunch. I wouldn't say it's terrible but it's not that great either. In our case, we went for the number 9* pack for 4 people and still left a bit hungry and our international friends very disappointed (sorry folks).  *Drinks and cheese are extra",-1,0
"We came here for a midnight snack post Blueman show.   This place was busy!  Waited in line for 5 minutes and decided to order combo #2- 4 White Castle cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink.   The very friendly attendant recommended the onion chips instead of their regular crinkle cut fries. Great recommendation!  It's like onion rings but in wedge form. Burgers were nothing spectacular; steamed mini buns with grilled onions, processed cheese, a pickle, and a ham-like slice of hamburger. This place is overrated but makes a good and inexpensive snack (individual burgers are $1.29). Do keep in mind that each burger is the size of a dinner bun.",-1,0
I was pretty excited to try White Castle and I was a little shocked to see Vegas had a location. I had no idea what to expect as I only knew of White Castle through H&K so I went in with an open mind. The line to the register wasn't horribly long and it gave me enough time to look up at the menu. Since I only wanted to try the burgers I just went for a very small meal option that consisted of a burger and fries.,-1,0
"Hmm.  As a native Chicagoan, I was STOKED to find out there was a White Castle in Vegas when I planned our last trip.  This one wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't wasn't the same as the ones back home.  They were tasty, and not bad at all, but they just tasted like the boxed ones that you can pick up at Vons, only with someone else heating them up for you.  I'd come back while drunk or on a craving, but for an authentic White Castle burger it looks like I'll be catching a flight from LAX back to O'Hare.",-1,0

"Growing up in Texas, we have always had the frozen White Castle burgers in grocery stores but never the actual castles. For some reason, the frozen white castle burgers have always been incredibly delicious to me. Disclaimer: I am no burger aficionado. I'm a simple girl, I can have a meal consist of frozen foods and be happy. I've always wanted to go to the actual White Castle after obviously being inspired by Harold and Kumar and I'm glad there's a location in Vegas for me to finally check out. The burgers taste exactly the same as the freezer burgers except the ""fresh"" ones have pickles. I can rest easy now that I can continue buying the freezer burgers back home and know that it does not taste any different from those at the actual White Castle. The onion chips are addicting as well. I would opt for those over the crinkle-cut fries.",-1,0
"I wasn't impressed with White Castle's food. The slides had more bread than meat, no flavor, and the fries were something you could buy from the local grocery store. I was impressed with how fast they moved us through the long line and how they served the beer.",-1,0
I got caught up in the hype of wanting to try this out.  I've had a frozen white castle burger a long time ago.  It was alright.  Coming here today and consuming their food I've come to the conclusion this place is an acquired taste.  The cheese slider #2 combo with fries comes with grilled onions and a pickle inside the sliders.  If I had a choice between In n Out or Smashburgers I would choose those 2 over this.  I didn't think the food was at the level of quality of other burger joints I've eaten at.  I recommend trying this place out at least once and let your taste buds decide if its worthy.  Or to at least say you've eaten at a white castle.,-1,0
"Nothing special except that the prices are way higher than the East coast White Castles! Well, duh Vegas!!! Ordered the #2 combo. It comes with 4 cheeseburger sliders , fries and a drink for $8.99. I really thought i was going to finish all that by myself, but i was wrong!! Definitely, come here if you want to what the big hype is. If you can't, Frozen version from the supermarket is not so much of a difference!",-1,0

Friendly staff. Expensive food. Not at all that good either. My bread was so soggy on my incredibly small little hamburgers... the only good thing was the fries.,-1,0
If I could compare the burgers they're pretty much the exact same ones from the freezer section at any grocery store. Unless I was hungover or drunk I'd probably refrain from coming back. Service was great though!,-1,0
"Never had them before but heard about them. This was a must try. So can here at 2am and it was super packed. Well it's located in the middle of the Vegas strip which is why it's crazy busy in there. So ordered the cheese burger combo number 2. The party is thin and the look of it was different from the kind of patty I am used to look at. Bun was soft but from the heat and being in a paper box and it was a bit too soft or bit soggy. Fries were awesome, they tasted so good.   I would come here again maybe. But I am not a big fan of their sliders. Not sure what's the hype.",-1,0
"Well, White Castle kind of is what it is... I don't think people come here thinking they're gonna get a gourmet burger or anything like that. White Castle is one of those late night craving fixers that used to not exist in the western USA, leave it to Vegas to make it happen. This place is a bit of a show in the middle of the night as most people are drunk and sloppy while ordering lol. The food itself is as expected, small but tasty, usually takes 4-5 of these bad boys to get you full. This is likely the only reason to go into the Casino Royale, as it is located within. Overall, recommend as a late night novelty fix, not necessarily if you're looking for a delicious burger.   Pros- Price Beer price Only one in western U.S.  Plenty of seating  Center of the strip  Cons- Average food A bit of a novelty burger  Messy  Cleanliness",-1,0
"We had to try this place...I've been to one back east, but that was in the early 80s. If nice then, all we get to have is the frozen ones. I must admit, I enjoy the frozen ones more cause they're moist and seemed to have more flavor than the ones at the Vegas spot. Didn't like the fries...but ok for a quick bite.",-1,0
"3 Stars is an ""A-OK""  We got a bunch of the single sliders, had a few and they were okay. You either hate these or like them, I highly doubt anyone LOVES these burgers. I wanted to get these because it's been about 20 years since I moved to California where there are no White Castles. I almost forgot about this business until Harold and Kumar came along and I got the frozen ones a few times a year. I actually liked their sliders as a kid...obviously they look much tinier now.  Anyway, we didn't like them enough to eat the 8 we got (I consider 4 of them as an equivalent to one normal burger) We took it back to our hotel room and I chucked the remainder in the freezer....I got hungry the next day and decided to microwave one up for 40 seconds....Maybe it's just me, but it tasted better after the freezer.  For those people complaining about the patty's color, it's because of the way it's made, doesn't mean the meat is inferior (most fast food patties are all roughly the same quality). They lay down the minced and semi cooked onions on the flat cooking area, cook and reduce the juices a bit, then lay the frozen patties on top of the onions, then they lay the bread on top and let the onion steam cook the patty, thus the gray color. Meat only gets brown if it's directly on the cooking surface.",-1,0
"I have been to Vegas more times than I can count, and I finally got the chance to try the legendary White Castle on my last trip.   I honestly wasn't expecting much. I feel like when places like this are talked about so much the food is generally mediocre. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try as a late night snack. We got there around 11 and there was a huge line. The wait was not bad at all though. The line looks long, but they make the burgers pretty quick so it goes by really fast.  I opted for two of their original cheese sliders and they came out really quick. The burgers are really small so I understand why they have such huge combos. I am normally a person who doesn't eat much and I think I could eat about 4 sliders. The patty is really thin and that is what makes the sliders stand out. There was nothing special about them, but they were the perfect late night snack.   I will probably be back here when I am in Vegas and craving a light snack in the middle of the night since they are open 24hrs. I am curious about how their other sliders and fries taste like so I might revisit the next time I visit Vegas in July. With so many food choices near by, White Castle would probably not be the first place that comes to my mind when I want a full meal.  Overall, White Castle is A-OK in my book.",-1,0
"Yes they have come to the strip, yes they are exactly what one would expect of a White Castle! Those steamy little hole filled burgers with those delicate little onions and that single pickle chip! To some they are a taste of pure heaven, others don't get the hype, I run the in between! I love the little buggers, but I'm not exactly a craver! This location does a decent enough job of preparing them, and they sell beer! However they are priced considerably higher due to it being on the Strip! Hence my 3 star rating! If you crave em, get em, if you love em get em, and if you just don't get the hype, In-N-Out is just down the street a ways, as is Shake Shack! Recommended if you're in the area!",-1,0
"We went here for a snack.  Overall it is a cheap one at a run down casino,casino royale.  We ordered the fish sandwich slider and the cheese burger ones to tie us over. Overall, it was great for a snack as it is not big and full of bread.The place was clean however and appearance held up.",-1,0
"This was my first time coming to White Castle in Las Vegas it was alright. The hype is just all it is ""HYPE"" nothing special, just something different. We don't have many options in Vegas for Sliders so this could be a main destination on your list. Location is kind of goofy and not very accessible to the local folk would like to grab a quick bite. You have to find some where to park on the strip and walk which is fine, but like I stated quick bite it isn't happening. Now to the food, Burgers are pretty decent no onions for me, but the onion flavor is echoing off the bun which gives it that classic White Castle aroma. Instead of hard microwave buns now they are soft and fresh and the burger is made right in front of me instead of in a factory  which makes it a plus. Now to the best item at White Castle the Chicken Rings. It reminded me of the old recipe Chicken Nuggets at BK. Reminded me of my childhood which resulted in yet another plus. Overall good spot for the Tourists and the tipsy crowd walking by.",-1,0
"Let's get this out of the way: this is not a foodie destination whatsoever. However, it's a way for people not from the Midwest or the East Coast to experience this cornerstone of American culture and history.  I was quite disappointed when I tasted the overly hyped White Castle offering at Las Vegas Foodie Fest. It was very mediocre and I couldn't believe that they would eat this stuff fanatically. When they decided to open an actual restaurant in response to the crowds, I decided that I'd have to give it a shot. Perhaps the sliders at Foodie Fest weren't quite ""the real thing.""  I parked at Harrah's. You might consider the Mirage across the street, the Venetian to the north, or the Linq slightly farther south, but I think Harrah's is pretty convenient. I happened to bypass the line (it's possible if you take a side door or just walk through Casino Royale) because I wasn't looking to stand in line at all. The line was watched by private security and extended onto the sidewalk outside the ""White Castle"" door.  The menu prices tend to be absurd, so I was really glad that Antonia R. and Renzo were kind enough to share some of their large order. Not that anyone should wander in here alone, but you really should share a 10-slider sack or a ""Crave Case"" of 30 sliders with friends/family if you don't want to end up paying $8 for four tiny sliders, awful fries, and a cheap soda.  In light of that comment, I'll discuss the sides first. The french fries are really, really bad. They're soggy crinkle-cut fries with barely any crispiness or salt. Pretty much every other fast food chain can beat this handily. The onion chips, on the other hand, are surprisingly awesome. They're crunchy and not overly greasy. They're like onion rings but in a small enough size so that you won't have that issue of eating the entire onion portion while trying to bite the onion ring into smaller pieces. Definitely skip the fries and get the onion chips if you come here.  As I'd anticipated, the sliders here had much more flavor than whatever they were serving before. You can taste some savory flavors from the almost paper-thin patties, enjoy the soft bun, and notice the grilled onions and pickle. I actually found the cheese on the cheese sliders to be a distraction. The cheese just obscured the other flavors without providing much flavor of its own. Order the original sliders.  Look, you really shouldn't go here unless you've never been to White Castle. You'll get more meat at a lower price at pretty much any other fast food place, even those on the Strip. But if you do decide that you must have the experience, make sure you're aware of the prices and strongly consider bringing a group.",-1,0
"Got there around 3 and the line went by pretty quickly. Order the 2 double sliders with cheese meal and chicken rings (since everyone suggested to do so). Since they're sliders I suspected that they'd be small which was why I ordered two. The sliders come with grilled onions and pickles inside just an FYI if you don't like those stuff. You can see the chefs in the back cooking and boxing all the orders so I would say it's not exactly ""fresh"" because they're just constantly making the same thing over and over again. The chicken rings were good, they were like thinner chicken nuggets in a ring shaped form. Overall, this place was nothing special. Never been to the east coast to try the legit thing nor have I tried the frozen boxed one.   At least the workers were nice and efficient.",-1,0
"White Castle is definitely overhype for what it's worth or maybe I came during the wrong time. You get a lot of food in your meal but it taste like your average fast food that you can easily get from any fast food restaurant. Some of the employees seem very impatient but you can't really expect much from a fast food restaurant that's always packed. It is worth the experience in Vegas to say the least. If I'm starving at 3 or 4 in the morning with no other option the next time I visit Vegas, I might give it a second chance?",-1,0
"Another Harold & Kumar fan checking in. Glad to finally cross White Castle off my bucket list. Still not really sure how I feel about it though. All of my bodily senses tell me I shouldn't like it. I mean, the famous sliders were soggy and tasteless, and yet I came away from it all kinda enjoying the experience. In a way, I can understand the appeal. If you're completely famished, it's easier to stuff yourself with White Castle sliders than with any other fast food burger precisely because of the very traits that make it so unappealing to foodies. Dunno if I'll ever come back, but regardless of all the bad reviews anyone who liked Harold and Kumar owes it to themselves to try the food at least once.",-1,0
"Way overrated! Only famous from Harold and Kumar. The food isn't that great and it is pricy. I would never recommend white castle but if you understand you aren't here for great food and willing to pay the premium, then by all means take the shot!",-1,0
"It's legendary so I had to try it. First impression: not bad.  It's a tiny burger for $1.29. You can buy them as part of a combo or get a pack....like a 100. I kid you not. It is on the menu. Personally, I'd opt for a combo with 4 of these mini burgers plus a side and a drink.  You have to eat it hot otherwise it does not taste good. The bread is soft like those Hawaiian rolls. It is not bad but honestly, I don't get what all the fuss is about.  There is always a line but it moves fast.   Worth trying.",-1,0
"I've been obsessed with this place since the movie, Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle. That movie came out a while back so I pretty much had forgotten about it. I was at the Mirage watching the volcano erupt at 8pm. I turned around and there it was, the bright sign was shining in my face. It was calling out to me, I had to go. They have no White Castle in Hawaii where I'm from.  We had just eaten at a buffet but I had to try this place out. I just got a cheese slider. My hubby got the chicken ring slider combo, which came with fries and a drink. I know that their sliders are small, but it must have shrunk some more because it was tiny. The hamburger patty was paper thin but it was tasty. They serve crinkle cut fries and not shoestring. At least the fries were crispy and not soggy.   The wait time for our three sliders and fries was 20 minutes. I guess this must be a popular place on the mainland.",-1,0
I came in with really high expectations of this place. Since the movie Harold and Kumar came out I've been looking forward to trying this place. I've lived in the west coast my whole life. 1st disappointment was the line out the door(1hr wait). So I decided to come back a few days later. I still ended up waiting about 20 minutes. The sliders weren't bad but they weren't amazing either. The fries and onion rings were pretty good in my opinion.  I hate the location because it's a pretty far walk from the parking garage.,-1,0
"A-OK.  Hubby is from the Midwest so White Castle hold a certain nostalgia for him.  He waited in line at Foodie Fest and always makes a stop when he goes back home to Chicago.  So when Vegas got a WC we had to check it out.  Got sliders, fries and chicken rings.  Line wasn't to bad, it was a evening midweek.  I thought everything was OK.  Nothing special but not gross by any means.  Sliders tasted the same as the frozen ones to me.  I wish they had the full menu but maybe that will come in time.",-1,0
"I was extremely excited when I found out White Castle came to vegas. I remember eating those ones you get in the freezer section at the grocery store. The burgers at White Castle taste exactly like the ones in the frozen section. I am very disappointed.   First of all, every worker here looks miserable. Does anybody know how to smile? Say thank you? Don't you work in customer service? I've worked in food and beverage and customer service for a long time and I know that your job can be stressful or whatever but at least look up at me and look like you care. I feel this place could benefit from the manager monitoring everyone. Anyway,  I order original cheese sliders and jalapeÃ±o cheese sliders. I am awaiting for my number to be called then loudly and obnoxiously on the intercom I hear mine. I'm pretty excited still. I go up to get my food and then ask for ketchup. The lady goes to grab ketchup and hands it to me without saying anything. Then I ask for ranch. She looks irritated and then goes and grabs me ranch. I also asked for mayo then she finally looked up at me, kind of rolled her eyes, grabs that even more frustrated and hands it over. She never said one word to me.  The burgers... were okay. I open the bun and the cheese is not melted. In some of them they were partially melted. But man.. at least throw it in the toaster oven or microwave or something. I hate cold cheese.   It doesn't look like I'll be coming back. I can just go to the store, buy the freezer ones and warm those up.",-1,0
"Oh, how I love White Castles. I haven't been to one in years but I saw the sign in Vegas and had to stop. I'm not sure if it's expensive now or those were Vegas prices, but it was steep for a sack of 10, onion rings, and fries. And, I was shocked that they didn't have Big Red as a soda pop offering. That's how you order...even though I don't drink soda really anymore. Onion chips have changed. I wouldn't order those anymore. And fries aren't as good as I remember, either is the fish sandwich. Awww...nostalgia got the best of me, but wait...the little bitty burgers were still on point.",-1,0
"we were super excited to try White Castle burgers outside of the ones we buy at the grocery store and microwave. our hopes were high because we do love these and figured the real deal would be way better. but to our surprise, they tasted exactly the same. luckily when we arrived, there wasn't much of a line but as we ate, the lunch crowd arrived and the line looped around the casino. i would have been disappointed if I had to wait that long.   I was impressed by the chicken sliders which were made from all white meat chicken. the cheese fries were also very good. all in all, this is the perfect hangover food but I would not consider it ""quality"" food.",-1,0
Been waiting to try this place for a LONG time since they opened some months ago.   I like that casino Royale put it in their casino.  Smart marketing.  I can't say I was disappointed but not blown away either.  The burgers were fresh but I didn't feel too much of a difference between those and the frozen ones.  They were decent though.  Once I got to eating the 3rd and 4th burger my mouth seemed to get dryer.  Not sure why that was.  Anyhow I would come back but it would be because I'm craving it...more like I'm drunk and it's conveniently in the middle of the strip.,-1,0
"Very Busy. Long lines, So many people in line the cooks needed a grill 10x10 to keep up. Burgers were great but not quite as good as the White Castle in St Louis MO. I think the fast pace and long lines of people has staff in to big a rush to make the perfect White Castle burger. If you're on the strip and you have time to wait in line it's worth the wait for a white Castle. And staff did seem really stressed out by the sheer number of people being served. Also price of the burgers are higher there then I've paid elsewhere for a white Castle.",-1,0
"This place isn't too bad, I'm sure you've all seen the movie ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"". Well we were always wondering if that place is really as good as the movie portrayed it to be or was it because they were having the ""munchies"".  I was finally able to try this place, turns out I stumbled across it while walking up and down the Las Vegas strip. The place is pretty busy, especially since you have everyone from the strip just drinking and looking for food. Which in all, isn't a bad thing. That means it must be good.  What I ordered was two chicken sliders with loaded fries. It's cheap, I only paid $8 and thinking these small sliders were not going to fill my appetite but they sure did. The chicken and buns were fresh, no stale taste. The fries were the amazing part to me, loaded with bacon and ranch. I just couldn't get enough of it.   Give it a try next time you are wandering around Las Vegas trip, it's quick, cheap and will get you fed so you can continue your Las Vegas adventures!",-1,0
"This place wasn't as impressive as I thought it was going to be..maybe it was all of those years of watching Harold & Kumar. Either way, I think my burgers could have been cooked a bit longer. Be prepared to wait longer for your food at night since this place is open 24 hours and caters to the drunks on the strip!",-1,0
"This place is whateves to me because it basically tastes like the ones you buy frozen.  My boyfriend was eager to come here so we did and he likes it.   The reason for my three star is that it's not that bad and I think you should come here at least once for the experience. You have probably been to many fast food-chain like McDonald's, Wendy's and Jack in the box... right? So why not add this to your list?  Yes it's a little overpriced but it's on the strip and  rent is high but if this place was elsewhere it will be a lot cheaper.   However Just enjoy it I'm sure you can try to win ten bucks at a table and try White Castle for free... Hahaha",-1,0
"The dying question, is it worth all the hype?! Really hard to say but leaning closer to a ""nope."" I never had the pleasure of trying the ""real thing"" but I do love the frozen ones. Frankly, it was not much of a difference from those, just the bread was ""fluffier."" Them pickles killed it for me though. :( I also got the an order of onion chips and fries for good measure. Yea...not really impressed and feel I haven't been missing out on much because we have In n Out. Yup, I said it. Deal with it. Luckily the wait was like 10 minutes so hey, at least I can say I tried it.",-1,0
"Eh   So I have always wanted to try white castle. I guess walking by the White Castle on the strip and having no idea it was here was similar to someone coming out to California excited to try in n out. I can't really explain the feeling of silly excitement to try fast food? It's almost embarrassing to admit.   Regardless on an impulse I went in with my friends, and waited in the ridiculously long line with a single cashier to place our order. We were looking for more of a snack and attempting to just try everything. Sliders, chicken rings, fries, and cheesecake stick is what we ordered to snack on.   Didn't realize there were pickles on the sliders, which I guess is my fault for not being more cautious, so that first bite made me cringe. However once I removed the green devil slice and got into the slider I was...well still not impressed. It's hard to judge a fast food place like a high class restaurant, but I was still disappointing. The slider was very akin to a McDonalds burger, and the chicken was airated. Fries were crinkle and a little bit cold which was upsetting.   If I had one close by I dont see myself ever really going over the other fast food chains which just are better.",-1,0
"Finally checked out a White Castle and sadly...it tasted just like the microwave kind. It was a bit of a long wait, at least 40 people in front of us, and only one cashier. Sliders were about $2 a pop, and there's a good amount of seating. Since we only ordered 2 sliders ours came out quick. It was tasty, but no need to go back.",-1,0
If you're going to get the CRAVE CASE make sure change it to cheese slider not the pickled one cuz after 2 slider you're going to get tired eating it.,-1,0
"My boyfriend brought my family and I to this restaurant. I like the idea that the chef cooks in front of you and our chef was hilarious, which made the environment more welcoming. However, the food was still too simple for me. The shrimp was marinated pretty well and they give large amounts so many of you will surely feel full.",-1,0
It was good very funny the cook would have been better to serve all the food together and not part by part ! Meaning he cooks the shrimps and gives it cooks chicken gives it cooks rice and gives it ! Man im hungry i wanna eat loool,-1,0
"This place is not really far from where I live so I thought.. Let's give it a shot! Meh... I expected more from the reviews :-/ You get very small portions for the price ($28 for an Half n' Half, with nothing else than the fried chicken itself and a little side of white pickled radish...). The original fried chicken was too dry, but the spicy marinated fried chicken was excellent. Juicy and savoury, very spicy :)  The service was excellent though, even for a take out. The place is nice, simple and clean. But don't go for the quantity... Also, I liked that they ask if you want the bones or not. Hopefully you'll like it when u go!",-1,0
Very mediocre fried chicken but terrible service. I ordered the food for delivery and it took an hour and twenty minutes. Chicken was no longer crunchy and fresh by then. Owner had the audacity to call me and tell me to tip before I even received my food.,-1,0
"Thought this place was legit 4.5/5 until a friend (whose palate is sorta missing) told me it's great. So I became wary and decided to order less. Well, looking back, thank f*ck for that. I don't go about spending 20$+ at KFC, so why would I do so here?  Turns out, the speciality fried chicken is probably just a less oily version of pop corn chicken from Popeye's, or some sort of general tao chicken. But if you don't pay 14$ for half a plate of general tao chicken (24$ for a full plate), why do so here -- and, what's korean about it? We had the garlic and soya boneless fried chicken (tastes just like tao chicken), because the 2 other 'flavours' are 'classic' and 'spicy' -- very interesting choices hmm.  Anyway the other thing that reviewers raved about is the 'buldak', or in english, extra spicy chicken... Extra spicy turned out to be extra disappointing. Basically, it's a stir fry of chicken with onions, carrots, and daikons in a korean sauce (dry rub in water). Annnnd it wasn't barely spicy. Price-wise, it's 20$ for that average sized plate (refer to pictures below)... which is a good 150% the price of what it is worth.   Now some of you are saying 'well you haven't tried their chicken wings'. My answer: fk datttt. If the boneless chicken is already kinda dry, I don't want to think about how tough the wings are going to be when the heat finally cooks through the bones.   What I liked about this place though, is that bell you can ring for service, and they give 10% off for people with the MCSS card.  It was pretty spacious and K-pop videos are played on two TV screens.  The owners were pretty nice, but I figured that they'd better be extra nice, because what they're cashing in for their KFC rip off is quite a stunt (and definitely worth that 4.5/5). But as much as their food goes, it's a 2.5/5: no go.",-1,0
"Located downtown next to Concordia, The Basak is a small and cute Korean restaurant. It was interesting seeing that they had an electronic device that you could ring to call the waiter. However I do think that for a small size restaurant like this one, one should be able to communicate directly with the server with the wave of a hand or an eye contact.  Food does look good on picture, but it can get dull if you order only chicken. Don't get me wrong, the fried chicken is tasty and well cooked. We tried both the original and the garlic/soya sauce, both were very good, I recommend the combo plate with half of both. Price point is a little bit high for fried chicken, especially because it doesn't come with any sides. You can order either a half chicken or whole, with bones or without. I would suggest ordering a whole chicken and splitting it in 2-3, since the portions aren't that big. This is definitively a heavy meal, and I would've appreciated it if it came with a salad and rice (they probably have a plate like this for lunch, but they should make it available for diner as well). Rice has to be ordered separately, and there weren't much choice for healthy veggies on the menu. Funny thing that happened during my visit was that we were told that they sold out on rice! How does that even happen in an asian restaurant? I was quite surprised since it was around 7pm.  TLDR; somehow expensive, cute decor, dry meal, quick fix, slow service, share plates, eat your 8-9 portions of fruits/vegetables at home.",-1,0
"First time trying this place. I got duck fried rice (which I've never had before) and it was pretty good. It was different from the fried rice I'm used to but less greasy so maybe not a bad thing. Teriyaki chicken was good although not the best we've had.  Cheese puffs are gross.definitely not a Rangoon or crab puff and waaay too sweet for my taste. It was okay but I'm still looking for something awesome out here in Goodyear and this simply isn't it. It's the best option we have found, but nothing compares to our favorite joint out in Peoria (Big Heng on 75th & Peoria).",-1,0
"I was pleased to find they offer duck on their menu & the portion of duck fried rice I ordered was plentiful. (Didn't blow my hair back, though)  I placed an order to go and was pleased with the item, but there wasn't anything special or terrible about it. I may have to try a dine-in experience just to see if we can give this place more stars.",-1,0
"Not the worst or something to go home ranting about (the best) I like their food, but I'm still looking for the home run in Chinese cuisine around my pad. We ordered the sweet and sour pork, and orange chicken with brown rice (a nice option). The portions were more than enough for two and I tore it up the next day at work. No one was in there when I came in, hopefully this place picks up because I hate seeing the small guys loose it in this big dog world. :)",-1,0
We have been going to this establishment for quite some time and have been satisfied with the food. The portion are not the largest we have seems but the food is good. The place is not always busy so it is nice when you want to be able to have a conversation. I would recommend this restaurant if you are sick of the big chain restaurants. Shop local my friends and support the mom and pop places!,-1,0
"Kenzo Ramen is a great soup place. When I've had too much Pho, Kenzo is a great place to find an alternative to my staple soup eating patterns.  I particularly love their big monster Ramen soup which I, unfortunately, can't remember the name. It's a huge bowl of mixed ingredients which is a great way to please my complexity loving pallet.   Their food is very good, their prices are reasonable, and I've never had an issue with their service which is always prompt and polite.   Although some say that you should never go to a soup place on a date, I would argue that Kenzo is a great option for such an occasion. :)",-1,0
Broth is very nice (though a tad salty in my opinion). Noodles aren't chewy enough for my taste but still good. Meat and vegetables and such are pretty good.,-1,0
"Came upon this place by accident, as I was visiting 401 Games located next door, and decided to give it a try.  Overall I would say this place is a fairly standard when it comes to ramen; the pork was tender, the egg was not overcooked, the noodles were nice and chewy.  I had their King of Kings ramen and the broth was flavourful but missing that depth and richness you get from a really good broth, but again it was overall decent - the ramen itself also had lots of other stuff in it as well (veggies, seaweed, ground pork). The service was quick and friendly, although I was one of two tables eating at that time.  There are definitely better ramen places in the city, but overall Kenzo is not bad if you want a quick bite in the area.",-1,0
"This place is alright - portions are bigger than Santosei but quality is lower than that of Kinton. In a pinch, it should do to quelch any ramen cravings.",-1,0
Not real Japanese food including donburi and ramen. Service is not that good. But the taste is not so bad. I will still go there for a quick lunch,-1,0
"After a long exhausting walk my girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to something special. We decided to give kenzo ramen a try.   We ordered Sho-yu Ra-men (7.95) and The King of Kings Ramen (12.95).  The broth for Sho-yu was nice and tasty and the ramen noodle was made very nicely.  Rather disappointed overall though, The king of kings ramen had a tasteless instant noodle tasting broth. It was as if someone mixed water with chill oil.   The waitresses were leaning on ambivalent about serving us seriously.  Let me assure you downtown has a lot of options, Will not be coming back.",-1,0
"Decided to have dinner here tonight after walking around aimlessly looking for a place to eat! I live around the area and did not even know this place existed along Yonge Street! I had the sho-yu ramen and it tasted great, it wasn't too salty, it was just right. The customer service wasn't the best but I'll give the guy a break as he was the only server. Prices are pretty reasonable, my ramen was $7.95!",-1,0
"Kenzo is a great ramen place in Toronto that rarely ever has line ups and the service is super quick.  I usually frequent the Bloor location, but the first one I tried was the Yonge Street spot.  The place is pretty clean inside and looks like your standard ramen house decor.  The staff are friendly, but you'll have to call them over at times as they are usually busy with the kitchen or serving.  The ramen here is a little greasy, but the taste is pretty good.  The broth isn't as clean as I'm used to with places like Kinton and Sansotei taking over as my favourites.  Also the various toppings aren't cooked as well or as delicately as those shops I've mentioned.  They add more of a Chinese flare with their vegetables and toppings over the traditional Japanese ramen, but it works well.  If I'm in a pinch and need to get something quick to eat Kenzo is a good place to go.  the ramen portions are also the largest out of any other ramen shops in the GTA and their fried dumplings will fill you up alone.  The price is right and the food is good, so definitely give this place a try.",-1,0
"Not bad, comfortable enough seating and the ramen was tasty. It also came out super fast. I'm no ramen afficionado by any stretch, but I enjoyed my meal.",-1,0
"My roommate and I came here before Nerd night for a quick snack. We both opted for the King of King Ramen. I like Ramen and it was decent with alot of textures, including the egg, the noodles, the pork and the seaweed. Broth was okay with a bit of bite. It was good and filling but I will keep looking for other options!",-1,0
"Well this place is good, but I don't understand the high ratings. I found their soup to be slightly salty and the portions somewhat small for the price. But like the other reviews mention, the service was EXCELLENT. Super attentive staff.",-1,0
"We didn't try the ramen, but we had the Gyoza and Takoyaki. The dishes were fine, but not surprisingly delicious. Maybe we expected too much. People who know Toronto well said they won't suggest this restaurant as a good place for Ramen.",-1,0
"Decent ramen although cannot compare to Sansotei. Its cheaper and good for lunch, noodles and broth are only average. I did really like their onigiri but they're really small.",-1,0
"The Kenzo chain in general is ""OK"". Don't let that deter you, I don't mean to attach any negative connotations with ""OK"", I really really just mean it's OK. Considering ramen options in Toronto in general, it's pretty good.  I like the atmosphere of this Kenzo a little more than the other ones. It's easier to be seen by waiters than the one on Dundas and it feels less gaudy than the one on Bloor. Every time I've been there it's also been quieter, with parties usually from 1~4 people. This might be why the waitresses are sometimes distracted talking to each other though, and they don't notice if you're looking expectantly their way with your meal done right away.  I usually just opt for their more basic ramens. My main complaint about Kenzo ramen is it's got too much going on. Too many bean sprouts, too much saltiness to the broth, etc. I can't taste that hearty pork bone flavour in the tonkotsu ramen as well as at J-Town because of this. As a solution I always order shoyu or shio ramen and water down the broth with some water.  If you're a ramen newbie, don't worry, the food is still pretty good. If you're picky about your ramen, you may not be too impressed by Kenzo, but it's not too bad, especially when you're really craving some ramen.",-1,0
"Kenzo Ramen is beginner level ramen.  It's what ""california rolls"" are to sushi.  If you've never had ramen in a restaurant before (as I haven't), it's a good place to start.  I can definitely now imagine the levels of complexity a ramen bowl could reach - just not so much here.  Things I liked: the service.  Such good service!!  Really 5 stars for that.  I liked my matcha smoothie, although it could have been more liquidy.  I did like the ramen, but it did have a ""one-note"" broth and the toppings weren't so insanely delicious.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but next time I want ramen, I wouldn't choose Kenzo, I would choose to go to one of the many popular joints I keep reading about.",-1,0
"This place is pretty decent.  I really don't know what makes this place stand out to be honest. The restaurant itself is decent, the ramen is decent, the service is decent, and the prices are, again, decent. It's nothing to write home about. I wouldn't choose this place to introduce my friends to ramen or anything like that.  It's a decent place to eat if you're in the Bloor-Spadina area, but if you've got a better place in mind, I'd go for that instead.",-1,0
"Actually I will not say it gave me very strong impression. Ramen was average, price was a little high than I expected. Environment is also average. I will not say I recommend or not, but if you walk by and never try it before, then you can give a try.",-1,0
I got the Netsu ramen in medium and boy was it spicy! Next time I'm getting mild. It was still decent although I'm not a fan of the noodles. Decent portion size. I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen as well and I preferred that. The broth and meat were delicious in that one. It seemed a bit small especially for the price.,-1,0
"Kenzo is a Ramen chain store in Toronto. I think it is good if you crave ramen but do not want to wait. I never had to wait for a seat at Kenzo and the food comes pretty quickly (under 10mins every time). It is a good fast food. As far as authenticity goes, it is not that authentic, it has some chinese food elements in it.  The broth is ok, it is definitely less flavorful than Santouka or Sansotei, but Kenzo is also much cheaper, gives you more food, and you have no wait. It is also close to my home, so during cold winter nights it rakes points for convenience. The servers are always friendly and polite and service is prompt. It is clean. The noodles are the wheat types and are decent, most times it is not overcooked.  Overall a good place for a decent, quick and cheap meal, but do not expect mind blowingly great ramen here.",-1,0
"With a sudden ramen craving that fell upon me, I decided to check out where the closest ramen joint to my work was with my handy dandy Yelp app. Luckily for me, Kenzo was less than 5 minutes away, hurrah!  You may not notice Kenzo if you're not looking for it, it's easy for smaller spots to get lost in the hustle & bustle of Yonge St, I find!  Service here is easily 5 stars. My waitress was super sweet, attentive, and friendly.  Lots of solo eaters and small tables, so if you are popping by on a quick solo lunch, or even just wandering the area solo looking for a bite to eat, Kenzo is ideal.  I went with the Tonkotsu ramen (which came within MINUTES of me ordering! Wow! Talk about speedy!) which was tasty, though I felt the pork could have used a bit more seasoning.   Minus a few points because a.) I think the floor must have been very recently washed because it was quite wet and I almost slipped walking to my table - no signs warning about this - eep! & b.) Got unlucky with a wobbly table (those drive me bonkers!)  All in all a solid 3.5/5. One of the better lunch spots in the area, not to mention some of the best service. I will most certainly be back!",-1,0
"There was a time where I absolutely loved Kenzo as it was the only ramen choice in downtown..... Now that kinton and sansotei and others will be in town, the bar is a bit higher and....meh, Kenzo's alright. Too skimpy on the pork, but the rest of the toppings are tasty. Would eat there when I'm lazy since I live nearby but would rather trek to Kinton on a nice day.",-1,0
"Ramen for less than $10? This is definitely the option for it. There are a few options under $10 here, like the Miso Ramen (7.95), the Shoyu ramen (7.95), and some of the spicy rames that for 8.95. So if you're craving ramen and not too picky of the taste, not a bad choice.  I picked the Miso ramen, and it was quite meh. The broth is fine, the noodles are fine, the meat was fine. Nothing was ""bad"" but I don't come for ramen to feel ""fine"". The ramen comes with 3 pieces of pork, a piece of seaweed, and a little bunch of bean sprouts. I kept thinking....where's my egg!  My BF ordered the dippable ramen, which was much better. I think it was about $12.95? But the dipping sauce was delicious, and came with the half egg, and a more flavourful pork than mine. I ended up stealing some of his dipping sauce to upgrade my ramen a bit.  All in all....everything is fine. But for better ramen (albeit more expensive), there's some only steps away up and down Yonge St.",-1,0
"I like Tonkotsu Miso Ramen and the king of the kings  ramen, the soup of Tonkotsu is better than the king of kings, but king of kings is like a value pack, you have everything in it and the quantity is big.",-1,0
"Wasn't the best ramen I've had in Toronto - I like Sansotei (on Dundas) better.  However, they have a lot more options to choose from, so if you want a variety of ramen, come here.  I prefer Tonkotsu or pork bone broth based soup, and I thought Sansotei or Santouka does a better job with the soup base.  The noodles itself were good but the meat was average -- it could have been more flavorful.  One of the must get items here is the fried gyozas.  They were much larger than expected and were very flavorful.  Didn't really enjoy the octobus balls.  Service was mediocre since my gyozas and octopus didn't come out until after my friend and I finished our ramen.  Had we not asked them about it, I think they would have forgotten about them!",-1,0
"I freaking love Ramen. Authentic Ramen. But since I am no longer flying to Japan every weekend, I'm a beggar and not a chooser now, am I? And what are ramen beggars left with? Kenzo.  This new location used to be the home of Bowl, a pan Asian restaurant (and shall I mention I served there for a while? ha). The new owners did not change much in terms of layout/design. The location gets + points because it is simply much more spacious than the Dundas location, but - points because it feels a little less like a Ramen House and even less authentic (wow didn't know that was possible).  Food is alright; the menu is identical to the Dundas one. I could go on and on about how ramen in Toronto is just not good enough and too expensive (I am SUCH a ramen snob, even bigger than I am a sushi snob)... but seriously when my choices are as slim as Kenzo or Ajisen, I still regularly - albeit half-assedly - satisfy my cravings at Kenzo. Now I just have a location that is even closer to my home!  In terms of side dishes, they are really average. I would recommend to just stick to the noodles, and don't try their ""fancy"" green tea drinks either. My personal favourites are always Miso, and Tonkotsu. But guys, you really gotta go to Japan.  Atmosphere - 2/5 Service - 3/5 Food - 3/5 Price - 3/5",-1,0
"I am a regular at Antalya Red Square, for lunch that is. The food is really good, the interior being a curious blend of Turkish chintz with a Russian after taste. One of my Russian coworkers identified it as Azerbaijani, a former soviet republic and part of the Ottoman Empire before that.  Anyhow, I digress. You might have better luck eating lunch there on a weekday than dinner. The server is really nice and hard working (read, overworked). My favorite is their falafel sandwich, chicken Shawarma or even the Lamb Kofte sandwich. As of May 2008 the lunch special cost 7 dollars including the lentil soup, not a bad deal.  The sandwich is hard to finish after the soup and hot pita but it keeps you full until dinner. The falafel is crunchy and wholesome, nestled in a bed lettuce, onions and tomatoes that benefit from the creamy dollop of hummus. Closed on Mondays.",-1,0
Always fun for a great Russian party with lots of food and dancing! One of the good ones!,-1,0
"Stopped in here with a group of fellow traveler's for the prix fixe lunch before heading up the road to the castle. The choices were actually pretty good, I ended up with a garlic cheesebread appetizer, salmon stuffed chicken and vegetables for the entree and a piece of fudge cake for the dessert.  The garlic cheesebread was not what I expected. It was served on a sliced piece of ciabatta bread with very little melted cheddar cheese. It was more like eating toasted bread. I couldn't find a hint of garlic in it, and I was expecting mozzarella cheese and this Italian sounding appetizer. It wasn't bad, but not what I expected. I was thinking more along the lines of an Italian dunker than half a grilled cheese sandwich.  The entree was very well done. Both the chicken and salmon were superb.  The sauce on the entree was also quite nice. The vegetables were a bit over done and were very limp and flavorless.  The dessert was also very good, and the waitress made this fun for us by playing a goofy birthday song I'd never heard before and bringing out a piece with a candle in it for one of our group members who had a birthday.  I'm only giving this 3 stars though for the price. I don't think it was a very good value. At 22 pounds without beverage (almost USD$40) I feel like the portions were a bit small and the culinary value didn't quite command that sort of price. It was included in my trip package so I wasn't out anything out of pocket really, but I couldn't recommend it to someone else unless it were a bit cheaper.  Nice little place though. Service was very good and the food came out quickly. Maybe other dishes would be better and priced more appropriately.",-1,0
"Let me first say, we were wearied, hungry and circled the town several times before stopping here. It was late and most Edinburgh restaurants stop serving dinner at 10 PM. We snuck in because it was close to our fantastic hotel - Missoni. So the food was no great shakes but not as horrible as other reviewers write. I had poached salmon with boiled veggies and man had spicy chicken something. Both good and not overpowering for a late night meal. We had a bottle of the Maxie's house red. Good for the price. The interior was small ans quaint; a little stone-walled, candle-lit room with a medieval charm. Nice terrace, too. What really stood out was the service. Sweet little cherubs served us with smiles and willingly provided tips for fun stuff to do during our stay. We hung quite awhile and relaxed, chatting with the staff and other guests. I would recommend for late-night meals after a long day of travel or sunny terrace pint stops.  We're told it rains more than not in Edinburgh so give it a shot on a sunny day. Staff easily gets 5 stars, ambiance 4 stars, food 3. Last note - one of the sweet cherubs tried to tell us we gave too much money, to which we replied, nope we thoroughly enjoyed it. Cheers!",-1,0
"Initially very impressed by the place, but then turned into an average experience in the end. You come down into a lovely cave like place with nice moody lighting. The food was pretty good but the service not particularly friendly and the place was too cold so I had my jacket on the whole time. Certainly cannot fault the speed of the arrival of food.....probably arriving worryingly fast for what we had. Hoping it wasn't microwaved! All in all, an okay place but absolutely nothing to shout about unfortunately.",-1,0
"I came for the sun, I stayed for some food and both were really rather nice.  Had it not been a super, super sunny and hot day, and had I not been looking for an outdoor place to eat, drink and soak up the rays (I shall defeat rickets yet!) I may not have come to Maxie's. But with it's prime location on Johnstone Terrace, overlooking Victoria Street and the Grassmarket, it got ALL the sunshine and did some quite nice pub grub to boot.  This is old fashioned British pub grub. Not nouveau gasto-pub posh burgers with portobello mushrooms and haloumi. It's the sort of pub grub I ate as wee girl at our local smiddy pub. Which is good in it's own right.  So, of course, I had breaded mushrooms and duck liver pate. And they were fine. Nice even. The chicken enchillada on the left of me looked really quite good, lots of chicken, fresh ingredients and not too cheesy. But pub grub food is as pub grub food does. No bells and whistles, but still good quality for what it is.  The next time the suns out I'd happily bob down here for another drink and bite to eat. Scottish tan (roughly lobster red) comes as standard.",-1,0
"The best thing about this place is probably how it looks... which is never a great thing to write about a restaurant/pub/bistro - I'm not really sure which one this place is supposed to be.  It was too pricey to be classed as a gastro-pub sort of place, but the food wasn't really restaurant standard, nor was the service. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, but the what you pay and what you get don't quite tally up somehow, especially when you've got such amazing places earby like the Grain Store or Maison Bleue.  It's just above Victoria Street, in the side of the hill stretching up to the castle, so if you get a table on it's little outdoor terrace in the sun then you may as well just write off any constructive plans you may have had for the rest of the day, because I can safely say you'll be sipping something cold for the rest of the afternoon.",-1,0
Came here with my family during my wedding weekend. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating seeing as every other restaurant nearby was extremely busy and had no room for our large party. I ordered a chicken entree which was extremely tasty. The rest of my family all ordered various items off the menu and everyone agreed that our food was good. Good food and great service is all I need when I visit a restaurant and this place delivered.,-1,0
"I used to love this place a few years back so when Ms Susie suggested it for a quick bite to eat last night, I was excited to go back.   It was really quiet compared to its neighbours but we didn't let that put us off. Maybe it should've been a warning.  Susie had the chicken enchilada & I opted for the tower of haggis, neeps & tatties, a real winter warmer.  The plates arrived & the portions were generous. Well the haggis & tatties were, the neeps were almost non-existent. The tatties looked as though they had been toasted under the grill but in fact the dish must've been keep warm in the oven as both the tatties & haggis were dried out. I tried to eat some from the middle but it just wasn't doing it for me.   I cannot fault the service. As soon as I told the waitress she offered me something else from the menu. By then I'd lost my appetite so they took it off the bill.  Shortly after the chap at the next table also complained. He though his breaded mushrooms were going to break his teeth!!  Susie's enchilada was definitely the better choice.   Overall I would've given 2 stars but for the decent service which gets it three stars. I may go back but when there's a wealth of competition it's better be good next time.",-1,0
"We stopped in for a snack and to warm up on a rainy November day in early afternoon and had a very pleasant experience sitting in the small lounge bar area. Only a few other people were there, the hot, mulled wine hit the spot and the other snacks were tasty.",-1,0
I like In and out burger.  The prices are reasonable.  the menu is simple. The burger is good. But I do have a problem with the massive lines and the seating. I assume that this is the way In and out burger is but I do not like to wait for a burger then have to scan the room for a dirty table that I have to wipe down myself.,-1,0
"It had been a while since I had been to an In N Out, and I figured I would give it another chance.  I've lived in California twice, and everyone there is obsessed with the place.  I can remember my first time visiting and thinking, meh, it's just ok.  So, I walked in to the Dysart location and stood in line for fifteen minutes and then waited ten more minutes for my food.  My opinion: meh.  Their fries are good, but their burger is nothing special.  Five Guys and Whataburger beat it hands down, every day of the week.  So next time I was hungry, that's exactly what I did....go across I10 and get something that I enjoy.",-1,0
"First off I love in-n-out for life lol, I've been going ever since I was a kid, however it was the California location, which for some reason always has that authentic taste but ever since moving out here, I've gone to this one every time because it tastes just as good!! But every time I go they always seem to forget something on my order..",-1,0
"While this wasn't my first In-n-Out experience, it was my first in a over a decade and I have to say, I remember it a lot better than it actually is.  OK, don't get worked up. It just didn't thrill me.  It was fresh, well made and just fine.  I just don't want to build a temple in the building and worship it like others seem to!    I got a double double with onion (and when they mean with onion, they mean it!), fries and a chocolate shake.  I liked the burger (could have done without the special sauce, which to me is just thousand island), liked the fries, although they needed more salt and loved the shake (perfect consistency and chocolatey taste).   The place was packed, the service was fine and the price was right!  I would go go back, but I like Five Guys better - sorry I do!!",-1,0
"I'd say this place is just a normal In-N-Out Business. You get the same treatment, the long lines, similar food quality and burgers, and the overall satisfaction of getting something in your belly after a long drive.  My friends and I stopped by this place on our way from Tucson, AZ to Los Angeles, CA and she was craving ""animal style"" fries so we had to stop by here.  If you do decide to make a pit stop at this place, I'll warn you now about the parking. The flow of traffic in and out from this restaurant business is awful. Lines build up and just finding parking in their small lot is a nightmare. We came around peak hours, unfortunately, and luckily found a spot in the corner to walk inside and order. I believe we got there around 12:30pm or 1:00pm and I never wanted to get out of an In-N-Out so badly until then. Haha.  But I digress. If you want a standard burger and fries that'll curb your appetite, this place is always the place to go to. It's conveniently located next to other shops and stores (like Taco Bell and Walmart), and is just off the freeway. How convenient!",-1,0
The food is very good but they never have enough help at this location. The lines are always too long and the staff is often not aware of the need to speak up and clean up. Typical In and Out food.,-1,0
"It's a good burger and milkshake-great for the price.  I am not a big fan of their fries, but I know a lot of people who are.  The hidden menu is fun to try out as well!  This place is always busy, but they have a good staff that speeds up the line quickly.",-1,0
I love In-N-Out you always know what you are going to get. But at this location they have one gal taking the orders that does not know what animal style is. She gave me just a cheese burger last time and today we went here and she almost messed it up again.,-1,0
"I have been to In-N-Outs in Cali and in AZ.  My niece from OH was craving it, so we all jump into the car and went.  I ordered the #2 (cheeseburger, fries, and a drink).  They still do not impress me, the cheeseburger was ok.  I love the fries but they have to be eaten fresh.  They taste soggy if you wait too long.   Smash Burger is still my love, sorry In-N-Out.",-1,0
"Ok food and great service. The owners, family and staff really make the difference. Duncan is a great host and a pleasure to talk to. Small but comfortable atmosphere.  Gate 403 brings in wonderful jazz talent and they promote young talent.  Keep up the great job!",-1,0
"We came here on a Sunday night for a live jazz performance and casual drinks.  It wasn't too busy so there was plenty of seating.  The jazz band was situated right in the middle of the restaurant so you could sit infront or behind the band.  No cover to see the band but they pass around a tip jar.  Service was friendly and quick.  They have a good selection of beers on tap with pints ranging between $5-8, fancy coctails priced at $8.50 and house wine for $5/glass.  Food menu has the basic pub food with a few entrees.  I don't know if I would come specifically to have a meal but it's an option if we're looking for snacks like nachos, fries or wings.",-1,0
"While waiting for a table at Barque we came across Gate 403.  Is the 403 in reference to Calgary?  Perhaps the owners are from out West?    There is live jazz nightly, though on this particular night (Friday night) they would only be on until 9PM.  There is no cover to see the band, but there is a tip jar.  The bar itself has a good selection of beers (both on tap and bottled) and a list of cocktails and wines.    The music was pretty good.  The crowd was mixed.  You had couples, you had solo-ers, and music lovers alike.  Can't comment on the food as I didn't have any.",-1,0
"Love this place in theory... but the music is SO loud that it makes it tough to enjoy a great conversation along with your martini and jazz...  (BTW: I'm not even an old fart yet... I like my music loud and this place gets on my nerves).  BUT, if you don't want to talk, it's great for live jazz....  The food is OK - nothing to brag about but not a problem.",-1,0
"Definitely wouldn't recommend the food here.   Drinks are a fair price.  Music isn't bad on weekends.   Service started out amazing but by the end of the night we had to pay with another waitress as our original disappeared into the night.   Overall - not terrible, but not amazing either.",-1,0
Came here for dinner and jazz with my friends who live in the neighborhood. It was not one of their best nights but the company was great and the staff were very friendly. The food was decent though nothing to write home about. The live band did play a few lovely songs and I can see how if I were a local I would enjoy coming here on certain nights when I expect the music to be good and would enjoy just sitting back with my glass of wine.,-1,0
"I had been craving for mexican/asian fusion for the past weeks and finally convinced by boyfriend to take me there last week. We had the duck tacos to start! (Awesome!) and a plate of guacamole with salsa and chips (not the most impressive but satiated by craving nonetheless). We then decided to order the tower of different appetizers which was quite filling. I would recommend this for a big group of people, not really the best for a couple.",-1,0
"Well, this is my first time writing for a food court vendor but honestly once I tasted their food , I felt like I was in a restaurant but this kind of food comes from a food court vendor. Vince BBQ & Chinese Food is a food court vendor that is operating in conjunction with their main restaurant , Vince Seafood and BBQ , which is located just steps away from the food court. Vince BBQ & Chinese Food is a great place for customers to have a quick , hot, fresh , and tasty meal that can be eaten at the food court or be available for take-out. Rather than having a sit down meal at the nearby restaurant, customers can expect to have quick and efficient meals in a matter of minutes. Vince does the classic stir fry dishes to perfection. They stick to the classics and customers will be able to enjoy these dishes for a good price. They have great combinations in terms of dinner where you can make a selection of how many dishes you would want. For example, you can select 3 items, which includes rice and soup,  from their special combo menu for $19.50 plus taxes. This is a great deal if you are feeling a bit off take out for an evening dinner. In terms of the fried noodles and rice, the prices are very reasonable , ranging from $5-$7, and you will not be disappointed, they are absolutely amazing.  The BBQ selection is astonishing, I have not had good Chinese BBQ for a long time, and if you want a taste of authentic Chinese BBQ, this is the place to go. If you can't decide what to order, I would recommend trying the Cantonese Chow Mein, Yeung Chow Fried Rice, Stir Fired Beef with Seasonal Vegetables, Salt and Pepper Pork Chop,  or their BBQ items with Noodles in Soup. I will defintely be coming to this food court vendor for a long time. Before I forget, try their Soya Sauce Chicken Leg Special ! $0.99 for a chicken leg, what a deal !",-1,0
Good dim sum and reasonable prices.  The food came very quickly and tasted good and fresh.  The specials are cheap and the staff are quite friendly.  The washrooms are really gross.....i wouldn't recommend going before eating as you'd probably loose your appetite.,-1,0
"After a quick trip around the Pacific Mall, my family decided to get a quick Chinese dinner meal at Vince's BBQ. It was a Wednesday evening and the place was pretty packed with local Cantonese speaking people. It looks like your typical Chinese seafood place and can be used as a wedding banquet reception hall during the weekends.   We ordered the $48 family meal which included chicken soup, bean curd and bok choy, red snapper fish, pan fried beef and mushrooms, and a plate of BBQ duck and pork. There are decent portions and we were pretty full by the end of the meal. My favorite dish had to be the beef and mushrooms and the bean curd with bok choy. The red snapper fish was flavorless and there wasn't much BBQ meat to go around for four people.   As far as the food goes, I would have given this place four stars. However, I had to take away one star due to the service. The hostess was nice but the food came out really slow. There was seriously 15 minutes between each plate. Other tables were also complaining that the service was too slow and that they weren't receiving their food. We didn't know if it  was because there weren't enough people working in the back kitchen or if they didn't have enough food to feed everyone. In any case, we could have saved quite a bit of time if the service had been quicker.  FYI: The waiters speak English but the waitresses don't.",-1,0
"We had dinner combo the first time been there. Roasted Duck was amazing. Duck skin was really crispy. Lobster with Noddles was quite tasty too. The second time we decided to try the dim sum, which is the lowest price I've seen. But the quality really let me down. The shanghai bun was cold. Veggie tofu roll tasted awful, the mushroom filling had gone bad I think. I would recommend dinner for sure, but certainly not a good dim sum place.",-1,0
"I came here a few times while I was visiting Toronto because they have like, everything you'd ever want for dinner. Seriously. When I was a kid, you could only get these dishes for like, a special occassion. But imagine going on a random Thursday and ordering peking duck, and crispy skinned pork and jelly fish, delicious steamed lobster. Just because it's a Thursday.  Soooo in other words, prices here are crazy reasonable enough that you can come here on a random weekday and decide you feel like having all those awesome dishes you could only have once a year when you were a kid for the price of any regular Chinese dinner.  Why only the two-stars then? Service here is definitely hit or miss. One time I went and it was gold. I was ready to throw down 5 stars. The next time I came was for my mom's birthday dinner. That's a big deal. But everything went wrong that night. They messed up dishes, things came cold, some things came tasting off, they sat us in an area that was pretty much a freezer despite the fact the rest of the restaurant was fairly open.  So you'll have to take your chances with this place. if I go back one more time and the place is decent, I'll keep my star rating at 3. Otherwise, I'll send another review to drop it down one. Just a customer beware sorta deal. You've been warned!",-1,0
"We came here for a CNY dinner so it was super pricey, and the service wasn't there. The waitress didn't serve the food, which is what typically happens during holiday dinners. She rather stood around. Don't expect service.. They do have some of the best bbq pork I've had in my entire life though. Everything else was decent but nothing special especially considering it was a CNY dinner.",-1,0
"Came here with unrelated Chinese 'family' for a huge dim sum lunch. We ordered tons and tons of stuff (see picture).   Everything was quite good, some particular standouts include their fried sesame ball with egg yolk dessert ('Jeen Diu') and their Har Gow/Siu Mai. Would avoid the steamed bun with the glutinous rice filling though. Bland and fills you up unnecessarily - save room for the other good stuff instead! Everything is steamed/fried fresh to order, which is refreshing compared to other places.  For dessert, the sweet deep fried Taro 'fry' is their speciality, apparently from the Chiu Chow part of Guangzhou Province in China. It tastes like a glorified french fry coated in coarse sugar - so amazing for some people and meh for some others.   Didn't see what the total price came out to, but if you come on weekdays before 4 I believe, it's 2.28 for everything, which is amazing value compared to all the other Dim Sum joints I've been to.",-1,0
"I've been going back to Vince regularly each week for the past month and I've decided to upgrade it by one star because the service has improved since I last reviewed the restaurant.  I find that going early in the morning when the restaurant opens is the best time to go. It's not so busy at that hour and service tends to be more attentive.  If you go often enough and the waiters recognize you, they will obviously treat you better.  I still think the dim sum here is good.  I recommend the shrimp dumpling in papaya soup and their rice noodle rolls. Sometimes the latter is hit or miss, but generally, I find that Vince makes one of the best rice noodle rolls in town!  The skin is thin and wrapped tightly around the contents, which is how rice noodle rolls are supposed to be made.  So what made me come back to Vince in the first place?  I was looking for a restaurant that's nice and quiet on a weekend morning and this place doesn't really get busy until 10:00 AM, and what brought me back a second and third time is that the service gradually improved with each visit.  Most of all, I can yum cha for hours and they won't rush me.",-1,0
"Vince Seafood Restaurant & BBQ has one of the most value in weekday dim sum offering around on a weekday morning! Before 11 am, it is 10% off $2.28  S/M/L size and free tea.  Not surprisingly that it was packed with seniors that ordering a lot food to take out for lunch and dinner later to enjoy.  Dim Sum menu is quite interesting with a mix of classical and chiu chow style dim sum. And at this price point, my Yelp friend ordered quite a few and more from the menu.   Shrimp Dumpling ""Har Gow"" - A-OK Pork Dumpling with Liver on Top ""Siu Mai"" - Meh, not crazy about overcooked liver Pork Rib with Black Bean and Olive Sauce - good portion  Bean Curd Skin Roll with Mix Chinese Vegetable - lacking filling Dumpling in Lotus Leaf - love this! great contrast of taste and texture!  Beef Tender in Spicy Sauce - Tender enough but really lacking any spice, more on the sweet side Crystal Dumplings in Fish Papaya Soup - huge dumplings!!! shrimp has great bite! Roast Pork Belly Roll - Not fatty enough and a little dry Rice Roll with Whole Shrimp - shrimp quite mushy and rice roll itself a little too thin  Overall the quality and quantity are great! A little mix up here and there but service is friendly and decent.  My Yelp friend wants to try the Steamed Fish Intestine Egg Custard... I guess have to come back another time for that!",-1,0
"I usually go for their dairy products like gallons of milk, eggs, and yogurts.  Friendly staffs and helpful employees.",-1,0
"They have a meatless section! Although there's a sign on the board, there really isn't a lot of selection for vegetarian alternatives in the frozen section. Was a little underwhelmed when I saw the sign -- I thought maybe I had found a little frozen vegetarian paradise. Turns out that's not the case.",-1,0
"We decided to go here for a late lunch/early dinner yesterday.  We split a sausage plate and got 4 different kinds - Kielbasa, Weiss Wurst, Spicy Beef and something else.  They tasted good at the time, but after we got home, my stomach was shot for the rest of the night and this morning.  We also decided to split the apple strudel dessert - it's the only one they have and it sounded good and was recommended to us by our waitress.  I took one bite and didn't have any more - the strudel was burnt.  It was literally black all over.  The  ice cream had freezer burn on it. I'm normally not so particular and will eat most things at a restaurant, but this was so bad.  When I told the waitress, she apologized and took it off the bill right away.    It was an okay experience overall.  It was a big let down from out first time going here.",-1,0
"I met some friends here, and I suppose my rating is a bit low, since I am not a beer drinker.  There wasn't much else offered to drink besides beer, and for a German themed menu, not to offer Riesling or some other light German wine seemed weird to me.  There is no other alcohol here besides beer and wine.  So I settled on soda, which had no ice.  It appeared  there is no ice machine.  The menu was limited, and was hard for me to order, since I'm gluten free.  I gave it three stars, since I've been to many restaurants where not drinking beer and being gluten-free is not a death sentence for my appetite.  If they expanded their menu slightly and offered a small variety of other alcoholic drinks besides beer, I'd go back.",-1,0
"I get the niche they are going for and the theme for their beer. I'm not saying what they produce is bad - it's just not my type of beer. No IPA or other hoppy beers. Definitely go if you're into lagers, ambers, etc. The atmosphere is great though, I will concede that. However, they are moving so we'll see if that changes.",-1,0
"One would be unlikely to stumble upon this location. Camoflauged among several warehouse looking places on an inconspicuous road off of south Tryon, this spot is a brewery first and a place of consumption second. The latter is a small, beerhall style area with high ceilings, long tables and chandeliers. Service is present but could use some work - only after sitting with our beers for a good fifteen minutes did the bartender/server? inform us that she'd forgotten to put in our order until just then. The brats were tasty, served with yummy German inspired sides on a paper plate with plastic cutlery. As a fairly young brewery it is understandable that the beer selection is focused on the two very drinkable standards, copper and mecklenburger, and the rotating seasonal, in winter a dunkel. After noshing we waited for the brewery tour (free on Saturdays!). It started a bit late but we got the beer 101 treatment, and learned all about this young brewery's mantra: fresh beer, pure ingredients, no preservatives, all local. It's promising. Still, none of it's current brews stick out much to me - as a Belgian style/IPA fan, nothing was quite hoppy or spicy enough, although the dunkel has a satisfying roasted flavor. Maybe with some years and experimentation I'll find a beer to love from olde meck. Either way I'd say this spot is worth a visit.",-1,0
"I stopped in whiile traveling thru because I had heard good things about the beer.  I had their lightest beer, which seemed to have a bitter taste, but after my second glass it started to taste better.  I ordered a braut, it wasn't good.  The roll was cold and tasted stale.  The braut looked like it had been heated in a microwave, no grill or stove marks and it had a after taste.  My advise is to stick with the beer.  My partner had the Copper and seemed to really enjoy it.  Again, after the second glass.  I guess this stuff has to grow on you.",-1,0
"Good not great.  I enjoyed the beers I had here but I didn't really care for the place.  It's an unique setup.  High ceilings, big long tables where you sit down with strangers to eat and drink (which ended up being a lot of fun).  The bar is HUGE but there are no stools.  I was told that's the ""european style"" - you stand at the bar.  Weird.  Guess my American-centric brain just can't get wrapped around how that would be fun....  They have a good location and a good variety of beers, too.  The prices aren't incredible - $5-6 for a pint - but that's ok.  If you're up for some good beer and making new friends, this is the place.",-1,0
"Probably one of the best tap house brew joints in town if you like their beer.  There in lies my problem.  Just not a fan of the beer they brew.  I feel like I'm not the norm based on the popularity of this place but they have also been doing a marketing job unlike any of the other micro/craft brew houses.    Bar area is nice and clean, lacking a little on TV's but not lacking in service.  I'm sure given the nice large room they can cater to some pretty large groups.",-1,0
"I enjoyed all the bier at OMB. Great German style heritage brews. The food was good but no there's a no non-sense take on the service with paper plates & plastic cutlery. Little disappointed they didn't have soft pretzels, they were out of stock, on a early Saturday evening...   The one non-beer drinking guest in our party was also disappointed she was never offered the chance to have a glass of wine,which is available. We'll give it a second chance when it's convienient and",-1,0

"Well sadly I have been forced to change my view of Spinato's.  April 3, 2013 I did my weekly visit to the restaurant to enjoy pizza and drinks with some friends.  In walks a young man and a young woman who were set at the table just next to me a few feet.  On his waist band was a 9 MM pistol.  I am fully for gun rights, as I own one as well, however what I am not for is eating dinner in a family establishment with loaded handguns strapped to other patron's waists.  Every one with in distance of the gun (which had a significant clip attached to it) asked why he felt he needed it in the restaurant.  What we all concluded was this establishment must not be safe if he feels it is necessary to arm himself as he did.  Spinato's allowed this man to carry this in to their establishment as under Arizona law they could choose to keep them out.  I loved you Spinato's, but I simply don't feel comfortable sitting three feet from a random stranger who is armed to the hilt and could take every one out in a matter of minutes.    I think it is fair to say we can all enjoy your pizza without a 50 clip strapped to our waists.  Or is your establishment so unsafe I should arm myself next time I come?  Unfortunately, I won't ever take the chance again.  I DEFINITELY will miss you...  (I changed my rating from 5 to 3...the food I give a 5, the environment I now give a 1---makes 3 a good compromise).",-1,0

"I came here because I wanted some pizza and I was hungry. Settled on a salad and a margarita pizza.   The salad was intimidating because it came in a bowl. The next thing that came was the margarita pizza. It arrived a little different that I was expecting. Most pizzas come on the tray it was cooked on sort of. Well at least the size of tray it was made on. You know the standard metal pizza pan. Instead the pizza came on a round rack on top of the pizza tray.  Then while trying to grab a piece of pizza I thought it wasn't cut all the way though. It look a while to figure out the pizza wasn't cut traditionally. it was cut every which way. The pizza was good, but it doesn't compare to my favorite pizza place. Some of the pizza didn't have topping on it. it was odd too because there wasn't a lot of cheese on it. There also wasn't a lot of sauce.  I liked the crust of the pizza because it was crunchy and not soggy. I think I'd try some other pizza if I did go back. It was good, but I'd try something else.   There was gelato there. I ordered two scoops vanilla and then one scoop dark chocolate. The dark chocolate was good. The vanilla was a bit sweet for me.",-1,0
"So i went here after church with some friends. I can honestly say, yes Spinato's is good, BUT this one is not as good as the one on Bell.   I really enjoy the pizza here. My one complaint is, the thick crust pizza is so generic tasting, it is a pizza hut reminiscent thick crust. which in my mind. Not a good thing. The thin crust is the way to go if you come to spinatos",-1,0
"We came here for summerlicious. The apps were the best part of our meal- crab cake and calamari. Both delicious. My dining companion had the lobster ravioli and I had the salmon. The salmon was a little over done. The ravioli was good. The trio of desserts were meh.  At some point I ended up with a bug in my wine glass. As soon as the waiter saw it, he got me a new glass, poured me a fresh glass of wine from the bottle and apologized for the incident.  If you are not in a rush and want to go to a place where you can hear your date talk, this is a good place to go. The restaurant was at half capacity, and we found the pacing and service just right.",-1,0
"A quaint little restaurant. Very quiet which was expected for a weekday evening. Food was great with the waiter referring to the ""Ossobuco"" as magic meat. Well I don't know if it was magical since I didn't see any sparks or flying pigs (flying veal?) but it was quite a tender piece of meat. My friend's whole wheat spaghetti was quite disappointing, such that she could not finish the dish. Overall not bad for an Italian restaurant, but would like to visit again to try out other menu items.",-1,0
"We came in here on a Thursday evening mainly because there wasn't a large number of people here. We were hungry and figured we would be able to get our food fast.  We started with the soup of the day (a sweet potatoe soup) and ordered the grilled salmon with pasta and eggplant parmesan (a special of the day) to have for entree. We asked for a recommendation for what to have with our meal and were recommended a red wine. The soup tasted good flavour wise but could have been a little creamier and less watery. Both main were good, but it was a little surprsing that the eggplant parmesan wasn't served with anything else (no pasta? no rice?). It tasted great (I love eggplant), but wish I was told that so I could order something to go with it. We didn't think the wine went well with the meal, and it was a little sour as well (the perils of ordering per glass I guess). For dessert we ordered the house made tiramisu. I liked that it was not overly sweet.  The service was friendly. We split the soup and dessert and they were nice enough to split the soup into two bowls rather than just give us another spoon. It wasn't as fast as we had hoped, but it wasn't necessarily slow.  Other thought: It is a little dark in the restaurant. I guess that's the ambience they want there, but a part of me thought it was a little too dark.",-1,0
"First let's mention that this place offers halal meat and does not serve pork. They do use wine to cook but if you mention that you eat halal, they can make substations for you.  Now, I came here with old colleagues for summerlicious and to catch up. We made reservations for 6pm. When we arrived, one of party was running late. But the server kept coming around to refill glasses and check up on us. When everyone was here, however, they tried to rush us into ordering a little. Eventually they stopped, to the point that we had to then call them over when we were all ready to order.  The excellent part is a lot of us were torn on what we wanted. They were really nice and offered us to somewhat combine dishes. They usually offer a substitution for the steak, instead of mashed potatoes and veggies you can get pasta. But the pasta is usually like penne. Thy graciously allowed us to have lobster ravioli as out pasta side. Two pieces of ravioli (the actually dish has 6 pieces) with our steak. We even got complimentary veggies to share amongst the four of us.  The downside to this great offer was that I ordered a medium steak and got something closer to medium-well. And the lobster ravioli wasn't that great. Although the sauce was amazing. For our apps we had gotten calamari, meatballs and crab cake. The crab cake was a bit lonely, just one cake. The meatballs were good. But tiny and only four. The calamari was delicious! The most pathetic part of our meal was the dessert. When put together it was pretty yummy, esp the ricotta gelato. The brownie was okay and the poached pear looked like tuna sashimi on the plate. It was yummy but two pieces of it was too much for the tiny dollop of gelato. I wish they hadn't presented it deconstructed on such a large plate.  So the food was hit and miss. My negative comments relate to the service. We were very pleased with the service until we finished dinner and dessert and no one came around for ages. Then they went to get four bills and did come back for another 15 mins. In the meantime I had to use the washroom. When I saw there was no toilet paper, I went back to notify one of the employees there. She said okay, but did not go to replace the roll. I had to borrow wet wipes from a friend to use their washroom ...... That is not good service. ESP in a restaurant. That isn't bustling with diners. Lastly, I paid in cash and it took another 15 mins before my change came around and we could finally leave.  This seems like a nice place, but it also seems like they won't be open for long. The food was okay, the service averages to okay. They weren't busy. I won't be going back. It's harsh to say it, but it definitely doesn't look like a business that will last.",-1,0
"We had a quick dinner recently. We originally called and they told me they can only seat us at 930. But we were in the neighborhood and thought to try our luck at 8. Got the bar seats. But there were so many empty tables around us !!  The food was okay. I want to highlight the octopus dishes and the charcoal veggie pizza. The octopus was soooo fishy and chewy, way more than expected. It took a few bites to get used to. But if thats your kinda thing, I'd imagine youd love it. The main reason to come here to try the pizza. It was not as I expected. It was a little dry and the black olives were extremely salty.  Not a big deal, we just picked it off.  Overall, the staff were friendly, the atmosphere was nice and the food was okay. I'd go back.",-1,0
"This used to be the go to restaurant for dinners after work or on the weekends with both family and friends.  Everything in the menu was great, especially the Specials and the Pizza. Service was great too although the place was always very busy.   For the past couple of months this restaurant is starting to lose its vibe - all the previous staff are not there anymore and the service is not great although the place is half empty.  The food is also not consistent and it often looks messy on the plate.  The Specials' board only has a few specials.. Drove by to have dinner last night around 8:00PM and there was only 1 table in the restaurant - I have never seen Motorino empty like that before.   I understand there are new owners - if they don't maintain the restaurant as it was before, including the food and service, they will lose all the clientele and it's a shame because Motorino is a great restaurant. Don't try to change the restaurant; it was successful before for a reason!!",-1,0
I went in January for dinner and enjoyed the menu and service.  Went back with my husband to find the menu had been  changed and I found the wine very over priced.   Disappointing. Not worth the money,-1,0
"We had been eyeing the new Hibachi Grill which opened up this fall at the Thompson Toronto, as we literally live a block away. So on my husband's birthday I decided to make reservations.  We ended up going with the prix fixe menu, with some upgrades. This  includes soup, salad, fried rice, sushi rolls, ice cream on top of the grilled meats and veggies. The fare was pretty standard for a hibachi grill, steak, chicken, scallops and shrimp. They did add lobster to the mix, which was nice touch. The scoops of ice cream were nice-sized, which is good cause my hubs loves ice cream.  The most entertaining part of course were the antics of the chef juggling his tools and setting food on fire. (See the two videos I posted.) I had previously asked to add on a birthday package, but as the evening drew to a close I saw no sign of it. Even my mother-in-law commented that a candle and cake would have been nice. A couple of gentle reminders later, the wait staff did serenade my husband with drums, a chef hat and really nice green tea cheesecake (yes, with a candle ) They even gave us a framed photo, which was a nice memento of the evening.  The only down side was that although mostly courteous, there is a little bit of a language barrier with some of the wait staff. This was a bit unexpected given the venue. None-the-less, it was a really fun evening.  My Rating: 3.5/10. 1.5 points deducted because food although good, was pretty standard, no delectable surprises. 1 point deducted for wait staff forgetting the birthday package and potentially embarrassing me in front of my in laws.  Pro Tip: When you make the reservations, ask to purchase coupons at the door. You get a 2 for 1 deal on the prix fixe menu, which works really well with the wallet.",-1,0
"I have to say that what really got my attention was the service. Our server was exceptionally friendly, and good with customers overall. I had just wished the chef would have been more enthusiastic. There may have only been 4 people at our table, but the show just seemed a little lacklustre. The egg toss and fire volcano were nice, but the performance just felt very ""let's get this over with"".  Aside from the service, I have to say the food was a bit of a letdown. We used a Groupon that listed a $140 face value for 2 people, which is a HUGE inflation.The food was just average.  Sad to say that I've had better miso soup and Japanese salad at AYCE restaurants.  The chef's choice roll was pretty decent. I'm not sure if it was chicken or shrimp tempura, but the roll tasted okay.  The teppanyaki I must say provided a substantial amount of food with LOTS of variety. Lobster, shrimp, scallops, chicken and steak cooked the way you want it. They give you dark and light sauces to dip in. The dark tastes like typical steak sauce, and the light tastes like a thousand island mayonnaise variation. Without the sauce the food is rather bland. While it has a nice charred flavour to it, a little salt or seasoning would have been nice.  The green tea ice cream was much creamier than I expected. To be honest, if I closed my eyes, I probably would have thought it was vanilla.  Overall a 3.5 star experience. Food was okay, show was okay, service was exceptional! After tax and tip, it wasn't too far from the face value. I don't know where $140 came from, but I really wouldn't have been able to justify that price.",-1,0
"If you want authentic Italian pizza, the pizza here gives you a product that closely resembles the real thing. Sometimes the pizza is very watery and other times it's right on. I used to live in Italy and I do not remember the basil on the pizza ever being burnt to a crisp, which creates a bad taste. I believe in Italy, they put the basil on after the pizza comes out of the oven.  Wish this place would focus on creating a better basic Italian napoletano  style pizza which is a high art form when executed correctly.",-1,0
"We came here because someone said this is the best pizza joint ever. First, the parking lot is just crazy. It's in the middle of a shopping center and movie theatre in summerlin. We got lucky tonight and found parking right away. It took a few minutes before someone realized we were standing there. Once she greeted us it took at the most about 5 minutes before we were seated. Not long at all. We ordered a mixed green salad and margeretta pizza with no basil. I didn't read the part on the menu that said the salad would only be drizzled with oil. My bad. Had I seen it I would of asked for vinegar. The salad was good. The pizza was on a super thin crust which is what I like. A little crunchy. Fresh tomato sauce. Portion wise wasn't too bad either. We were able to split the pizza and salad between two people and walk out full.",-1,0

"You may enjoy the atmosphere however on a cold wintry day even in Las Vegas the food does arrive cold. Very similar to the way that the wait staff is. Very unimpressed with their staff. Never asked how the meal was because then we could have told them that it was quite cold where we were sitting. The table although nice for atmosphere, is very unsanitary since it's unfinished wood. My friend when she was dishing up ur own salad dropped several pieces of salad as well as pine nuts etc and they just settle into the nooks and crannies of this table. I will say that they do give you a lot of whatever toppings are listed for that pizza, are on that pizza. We had the settebello pizza and it did have plenty of sausage and mushrooms and pine nuts on it however not too much cheese. But all in all it did come with the variety of toppings that was stated on the menu. I'm glad I was warned about the pie being wet, that is not my preferred style however this was the style and it was something that I was aware of. All in all a so-so experience",-1,0
"Came in to try out their happy hour. They have two times 3-6 and 830-close.   The table ordered Moscow mules ($5), arancini ($5), Diavola pizzette ($5), Vico pizzette ($5), and a Emilia pizzette ($5). This was a great way to try out the different pizzas they had to offer.   There were two arancini that came with the order. The crust was delightfully crunchy and crisp which complimented the fluffy filling and tangy marinara sauce. (4/5)  The diavola pizzette was topped with crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell pepper, crush red pepper, garlic, mozz, and some evoo. Unfortunately with the amount of toppings, the dough of the pizza soaked it all in and became a mush when I bit into the slice. It was more of a salad with a charred crust. (2/5)  My favorite from the pizzette as was the Vico. Toppings on the Vico included sausage, red onion, mascarpone, basil, mozz, evoo, and roasted fennel. The pizza managed to stay in one piece when picked up unlike the diavola. The texture was awesome with the creaminess of the mascarpone mixed with the succulent sausage and the crunch of the roasted fennel. I would come back for this pizza! (4.5/5)  Lastly, the Emilia pizzette had prosciutto cotto, Italian cream, mozz, evoo, parmigiana reggiona, and corn. This was a very savory and creamy pizza. It lacked acids to balance the flavor and had me taking sips of the Moscow mule to cut the richness. (3/5)   Although I can't say this place is my definite go to for pizza in the neighborhood, their Vico pizza will have me coming back...for happy hour!",-1,0
"I came here in my attempts to carpe diem on their HH deals. Hence, all orders were limited to their HH menu out of our choice.  Pizza Diavola (crushed tomatoes, red bell peppers, spicy salami, garlic, mozzarella, basil and olives) - 3 stars.   Pizza Vico (sausage, roasted fennel, mozzarella, basil, olives, red onions) - 3 stars.   Crostini con crudo (Prosciutto crudo and shaved parmesan) - 2 stars.   Crostata ricotta with nutella- 2 stars.   I'm generally a fan of a crisp crust, including the bottom having a slight crisp. The pizza was soggy, a bit too soft for my taste, and basically falling apart as soon as it was picked up. I think this could be a matter of preference, but I thought everything we had was OK.",-1,0
We ordered two pizzas and neither were spectacular. I had the Settebello and everything kept running off of the pizza because the crust was so soft. Usually I prefer a sturdy crust. I will go back to try it again but my first impression wasn't great.,-1,0
"Decor is pretty nice, all of the flavors are there. Although, I got about 2 cloves of sliced garlic on one piece of pizza (about 13 slices) most of the garlic was all in one place. Overall they need to work on quality and quantity control of the food that they produce. They must also work on the art that is pizza.",-1,0
"After hearing good things about the place, my friend and I went on a Monday night to try out their handcrafted pizzas. The interior is very beautiful for a pizza place, I like that you can see the pizza oven in the back of the restaurant. When we walked in, there was no one to greet/seat us, even though the restaurant was barely half full. We stood there for a few minutes before a server acknowledged us and yelled to a girl standing by the pizza oven chatting to the cook. That's when I realized she was suppose to be the hostess, but she obviously thought talking to the cook was more important. Moments before, a large group had entered the restaurant and stood behind us, and the hostess ignored me and my friend and immediately spoke to the guy behind me and asked if they had a reservation. Perhaps she thought we were all one party, but I thought that was pretty rude of her not to ask.   When we were finally seated, we were unable to get menus right away because they had run out. How do you run out of menus on a Monday night when it's not busy? I'm sure the Office Depot down the street can make color copies at $0.25 each...  Aside from that, our pizzas were pretty good. I'm not a big fan of pizzas, but I love the crispiness of the crust and how you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I had the Vico, which was basically a white pizza with no tomatoes, and it was surprisingly very filling despite it being a very thin-crust pizza.  Long story short - good food, subpar service.",-1,0
"The food here is good but not great. The pizza is always soggy in the middle, no matter the topping. The outer crust is perfect, chewy and a little dense. I'm flummoxed as to why they use arugula as the only green in their salads.   I have been to Settebello in UT, CA and this location twice. I keep trying to give them another shot but they always fall short.  The problem is the service. I have never been asked if I would like dessert or coffee, and I do want both. I am a middle aged average looking Caucasian woman. Usually dining out with the hubby or friends. I like to enjoy my meals out. It is not up to the server to decide that I shouldn't have dessert, and that is what I'm feeling here. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but dinner last night was the last straw. Eric, our waiter, seemed like he couldn't get us out the door fast enough. We had to ask for refills on our drinks and when we did he brought our check. No dessert and no more Settebello. Someone at corporate needs to make sure the wait staff is trained properly.",-1,0
"Our family has a pizza place that we usually go to but one evening we decided to try something new. I heard great things about Settebello so that was where we headed. The restaurant has a dim romantic vibe to it, which didn't really suit us that evening since we had our 4 year old.   I ordered a caprese salad that was delicious but nothing I couldn't make at home.   My bf got us an appetizer to share. It was delicious, but I had recently got my braces put on, so hard crusty bread was not my friend. I had a SMALL bite of it and from what I remember, it was delicious. I believe it had artichoke, prosciutto, and ricotta (?)  I forget all the toppings that his pizza included, but I DO remember that the center of each pizza (our son got a regular, kid-sized, cheese pizza) was soggy :( The sauce was delicious but a little too thin.   The service was quaint and I remember our waitress mixing the two juices that our son couldn't decide on together, which he thought was pretty neat.   I don't know if we'll be back only because we've already got a favorite pizza place, but the experience was nice.",-1,0
"Where do I begin? Well how bout I start with I got what I expected. Meaning after reading numerous Yelp reviews about how the pizza is either a hit or a miss because of the wet or uncooked pizza dough. I could see why some people wouldn't care for it. For me I knew it was going to be like that so I guess I wasn't as disappoint as oppose to someone who wasn't expecting soggy center.   I came right when they open first customer of the day. The restaurant itself is super cool, very rustic and stylish. Classy with lots and lots of space. The bar to the left is a great size with flat screen TVs. The kitchen is sort of open with an awesome oven for pizza prepping. I also notice a nice size private dinning room which can be closed off to the rest of the Resturant.   We were greeted nicely and seated promptly. I started off with the Insalata Grande which was dresses lightly but perfectly with a balsamic vinaigrette. The fresh mixed greens with baby arugula was simply topped with their amazing roasted or more like sautÃ©ed mushrooms, delicious salty olives, tomatoes, shaved parmigiana and the best chunks of juicy tender artichoke hearts. But the best part of it was the pine nuts. It gave the salad the crunch it needed.   Wife and I shared the Signature Settebello pizza. Waitress kindly described their pizza as being thin crust with chard crust and ""chewy"" dough meaning it's completely wet in the middle where you can't even pick it up even if you had skills. The pizza came out pretty quick and had lots of flavor the sausage was amazing the chard crust was something I really dig but yes the center was  soggy. There has to be a way for them to make their yummy pizza with a more cooked and not so wet center. You almost have to use a fork to eat it properly without a fork just forget about trying to pick it up.   Other then that I really did like what I had, priced fairly but I wasn't blown away to where I will come running back. Very nice Resturant and will return just not any time soon.",-1,0
Pizza is wonderful... Coffee is terrible Service is Terrible Great Place and Location... They need to improve on their product and get a whole new crew.  Coffee in Italy is wonderful...

"We brought our geriatric dog here when our regular vet wasn't able to see her due to a temporary staff shortage. Our old girl had a large abscess that had started to drain, and needed to be looked after. The staff seemed very compassionate and knowledgeable, even though we were squeezed in last minute and ended up staying past closing hours. They took very good care of our 15 year old pup, and, although not pretty to look at, her abscess has been drained, shaved, and she's been put on antibiotics for 2 weeks. The vet was caring, *definitely* knowledgeable, and very patient with us and with Dixie... even with our 4 year old, who wouldn't sit still for love nor money! If we ever need a ""back-up"" vet (they're a bit far for us to travel to on a regular basis), they're the ones we'll be calling on!",-1,0
"Really wanted this place to be good...very cute and clean with a great polish selection and very nice staff, but my nails are not great.

So bummed I paid $60 for these results.",-1,0
"Came here with my mother and sister in-laws to get our Christmas mani + pedi done. We have tried most of the nail salons around this area. We are trying to find one that we can come back regularly to that we like by so far we skip around. This place has a cute and modern setup. They do a really good job taking their time doing the massages and hot stones on your legs. Most nail salons offer the same service but they rush through and sometimes don't even do the hot stone. I'm impressed so far. Now my gel nails didn't turn out so well, but could be the lady that did mine wasn't familiar with the colors I was asking for ( red with silver tips ) because it took her awhile to find the silver I wanted. She used a dark matte gray then a clear glittery gray, which didn't look right against the red she did. Finally she went and got another nail tech to help her. That tech found the silver I wanted and finished up right away. The red turned out to look more like Dorothy's shoes from wizard of oz, which wasn't what I was looking for but honestly I may give them another try because they did a great job with the pedi.",-1,0
"This place is ok. The person who was designing my nails completely botched them, stating that he hadn't done them in a long time. Don't provide the service if you don't know what you're doing. Other than that, the service was very friendly and helpful. I will get waxed here but probably never come back, seeing as I am picky with my nails. They came out bumpy and the designs look like they were done by a 2 year old.",-1,0
"Went for lunch on Sunday. I'd almost give it 3.5 but it is not quite there yet to give it 4. The food is good but not so good I'd recommend it to others when there are better places around the square (Graze, Merchant, etc).   The cider on draft was very good and they have a nice selection of beers. The bartender was not overly interested or friendly so that was a partial disappointment.  Our table was right by the door so every time someone walked in I was blasted with cold air. Not sure if anything can be done about it, but it made my dining experience less pleasant.   We got the beer cheese pretzels. They were very good but the portions were kind of small. I saved the leftover cheese to dip my fries in.  Two of us shared the burger and they did a nice job splitting it. The homemade chips were quite tasty as well.  Overall, it is a good place and a decent choice. I went once a year ago and had their fish and chips (Old Fashiioned had an 1.5 hr wait so we went to Coopers instead). I don't feel you'll get a bad meal there. I just have not have such a stellar experience that I would make it top of my list.",-1,0
"i've been here a few times now. the beer list is pretty solid, but the bloody marys are just ok. the turkey sandwich is awesome (with gouda and apple-pear slaw, yum!), and they definitely get points for having poutine on the menu. i would come more often if it wasn't always packed to the gills.",-1,0
"This is a great place for groups, everyone else not so much. If you have a noisy, boisterous group of people that want very good food & a wide selection of excellent micro/import beers on tap, this is your place. The wait service is a little indifferent, but if your busy talking with your party, you won't notice. I would be interested to see if it would be different in the summer when they have outdoor seating.",-1,0
"The atmosphere was cramped and the service seemed kinda rushed but the food and the drink selection were decent. While I enjoyed the pork belly mac and cheese, I think the pork belly would probably be way too rich for most people. I think it's more of a bar than it is a restaurant and that might be OK for some but it was difficult for me to hold a conversation and have a relaxed dining experience here. I would maybe come back here for drinks or a quick bite, but maybe not for dinner again.",-1,0
"The place filled up fast. It has a unique interior look. We ordered soup and sliders and asked for it all to come together. We got the sliders but then soup was about 10 mins behind. The sliders were awesome.  I can't say the same about the soup though. The service was ok. I thought the prices were on the high side. It wasn't Ooo ah and it wasn't yuck, so I rated them right in the middle.",-1,0
"Coopers used to be my #1 recommendation for anyone visiting Madison.

"I've been to the Cooper's Tavern 3-4 times, and my best experiences have been at brunch or lunch on weekends.   First of all, yes, the poutine is amazing. How could it not be? On my most recent brunch trip, my friend was feeling torn between getting eggs benedict or poutine, until I pointed out that not ONLY is there something magical called a Poutine Benedict (think poutine with poached eggs and hollandaise), it's only $6! What a steal. And it's as great as you want it to be. My friend wisely asked for a side of gravy with hers, which I did not think to. We shared it the gravy with our respective poutine benedicts -- highly recommend the side of gravy, as there wasn't enough hollandaise to dip fries in. Also the gravy is just delicious.  The tap list is always impressive, but the bloody mary I got failed to meet my expectations. It might have been strong, but it was watery and nearly flavorless. I don't know how that is even possible in a bloody mary?! Also, our service was pretty terrible. Among other things, I asked for hot sauce and didn't get it until 3/4 through the meal, after asking yet again. Our water glasses were also empty a lot.   My dinner experiences are what drag my rating down from 4 to 3 stars. Most recently I ordered the pretzel crusted chicken, which came with butternut squash hash and a mustard cream sauce. The hash was delicious, but the chicken was super dry and hard. What made that worse, was that there was nowhere near enough mustard sauce to salvage the chicken, make it softer or more flavorful. In general, I just wish their menu was a little more extensive.  My advice: go to Coopers for drinks and poutine, or for brunch -- but don't order the bloody mary. Come to think of it, my friend ordered and Irish coffee and wasn't too impressed with that either. I'd stick to beer.",-1,0
"Hm. First I hit three stars, then four...and back to three. I've been here twice, once was intentionally for brunch, and another for lunch. I'd go again if someone suggested it, but it's not at the top of my list.  Everyone seemed happy with their food choices, and the menu is interesting. My last dish was the sweet potato chili. Flavorful and spicy, but thick for my taste. Cornbread was less than memorable.   Service was nice, and the food came out lickety-split. Also, the server didn't roll his eyes(can't say the same for myself) when my boyfriend's mom had to be explained what a ""shot of soup"" is. Um, it's a shot. Nope, not a small cup. It's a shot glass--and then she asked for a spoon for her shot. Oy. That alone almost deserves a star.",-1,0
"I went while I was traveling for work with a bunch of co-workers. We ended up buying 6 different meals so we could do family style and get a little bit of each. The place is really loud and busy, which can be expected for a pub type restaurant. I had some hard cider that was really good. The food was ok; I really liked the pretzel chicken and the cooper's burger. The chicken sandwich with chipotle sauce was pretty dry and flavorless. I tried a bite of my friends macaroni with lobster and was not a huge fan...neither was he :(  The burger sliders were pretty good along with the steak frites and the pork chop. The server was courteous and she even spilt our bill for us which I know is a huge pain in the a$$. With the number of great restaurants in the area, I think I would try something different if I were to visit there again.",-1,0
"Spending two hours rallying really works up a girl's appetite, so I decided to come and try this place out, as I've been meaning to for awhile and been too lazy to leave my hermit cave of an apartment.  I ordered the Cooper's Burger and it was pretty good: grass-fed beef, pork belly, some fresh lettuce and a nice aioli to taste. The food was easily four stars and was pretty good.  The bathrooms are kept very clean (although, there's only one). The service is also pretty decent; I've seen some inconsistencies here about it and I was a little weary before I walked in, but I must've been lucky and came on a good day because my waiter and the manager were both quite friendly.  This place is pretty small and some of the seating is kind of awkward; I was placed inbetween two groups by myself when there was plenty of other seats elsewhere. I'm sure it might've been easier on the waiters, but it was just kind of weird to be seated next to a family and two guys talking about finances.  Also, the alcohol list is pretty nice; at least 3 pages on beer alone. Kind of hot, actually, even if I'm not huge on beer.  That said, it's a pretty affordable place, the service is relatively friendly if you come in on a good day, and it's got a nice view of the capitol. But I'd avoid bringing large groups of people and kids--don't think this is a good place for either.",-1,0
"Oh, the dulcet tones of RE CALL WALK ER while we attempted to enjoy our al fresco dinner.  Which isn't to say that I disagree with the sentiment - just that it interfered with the otherwise very pleasant ambiance of Coopers Tavern.  We stopped in for dinner a few weeks ago on the recommendation of our Airbnb host - when he learned we liked beer, he insisted that we try Coopers.  We were grateful for the recommendation!.  I really enjoyed the Irish Cobb salad - house-cured corned beef, oven-dried tomatoes, asparagus, hard-boiled egg, Dubliner, and scallion-mustard dressing - but we were disappointed in the beer cheese pretzels, as the ""dip"" was more like soup.  I'm not sure where to rate the service, exactly.  I think our server was new, but she was definitely enthusiastic, peppering us for our drink order before we'd had a chance to open the menu.  When my husband asked about a beer listed on the menu, she informed him that they were out but it was SO GOOD.  Very helpful!  He really wanted the beer, and now would obviously have to take his drinking dollars elsewhere if he wanted to try something that was obviously recommended.  Despite that overly grumpy digression, we'd definitely give this place another shot.",-1,0
"I'm so fancayyy, you already know.....  My husband heard good things about this place through co-workers and friends, so we decided to have lunch here one day before catching a movie next door. It was pretty quiet during a weekday, but there were a few people coming in to pick up their phone orders. Our server was very nice. We mentioned that it was our first time there and he explained the menu to us in detail, as well as what pizzas from Napoli were all about. We decided to share one pizza, but couldn't decide what to order. In my opinion, I feel like it's a bad sign when the menu is complicated and when I don't see anything appealing. Thankfully, our server tried his best to help us out. He asked us what kind of pizza we were looking for, and we replied, ""something with meat."" I can't remember the name of the pizza (nor do I see it on their online menu), but he did suggest a cheese pizza made with meat sauce. He said that they don't have traditional pizzas like pepperoni or sausage. So we just went with his suggestion. We also ordered a salad and I believe it was called the Insalata. It was the simplest sounding one on the menu.  I must admit I am picky about my salads. The leafy greens that are used need to be dark green and fresh! Not light green with brown on the sides. That being said, they did use good quality greens! However, I didn't really like the vinaigrette on the salad, it tasted quite bland. I prefer my dressing to have at least some taste. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the pizza either. Yes, the ingredients were fresh and hot, but the pizza was hard to eat. The main problem was that the crust was very thin and with every bite, the ingredients would just fall off. Kind of felt like I was just eating crust most of the time and it was pretty messy. Thankfully, ordering dessert was a great idea. The Tiramisu was delicious and not too sweet. The coffee flavor wasn't overpowering (or lacking) like how it was at other restaurants. I thought it was funny how they put ""contains raw egg"" in the description on the dessert menu. When we asked our server about that, he said ""Well, it starts off with raw egg, then it gets mixed with...."" Umm ok, so that means a lot of dishes start off with raw egg, right??  Anyway, now I can say I finally tried it, but was not impressed. Fancy pizzas are definitely not for me. I will happily stick to my boring Pepperoni Pizzas, thank you very much!",-1,0
"Very mediocre pizza. I've tried this place two different times, with similar results. They don't know how to regulate their ovens, so their pizza comes out soggy. We had to send ours back two times and we gave up. They have excellent salads,  they are friendly and give good service. I understand Monday's are a good time to go...I'm not sure I have pizza forgiveness",-1,0
"I like thin crust pizza, but more crispy would be better.  I had the marghrita and it was too oily and soggy for my taste.  Salame plate was excellent.  Service was mediocrity at best.  Felt rushed out door.  No offer for dessert or coffee.  Oh well.  Won't be back.",-1,0
"This is a beautiful place, the service was friendly, attentive, and as far as I'm concerned can't be improved on.  We stopped in for some pizzas and I just wasn't impressed.  We got a carbonarra which had 4 slices if pancetta and maybe 3 small leaves if basil on it, not enough for me.  The eggs are scrambled which really killed it for me.  The cheese was just a little light but not a problem.  We also had the mageritta DOC and 5 slivers of cheese is not enough for me on that either.  I like these pizzas a little thicker and more sauce so you can scoop it all up with the crust.  The dough was tasty and cooked very well.  Prices are right about par for a place like this.  I've had better wood fired pizza here locally and I do not go to pizza house for the decor.",-1,0
Pizza is better than some. The crust is soggy and pizza is difficult to eat. Decor is cool and service is good.,-1,0
"I am the type of individual who loves pictures to be able to see what the food looks like but unless you look on yelp that's gonna be your best resource.  The descriptions of all the pizzas sounded good so it was a little difficult to choose.  However we asked the waitress what was the popular and she mentioned the Diavola and Settebello. The boyfriend and I shared the Diavola, and we ordered it extra crispy and asked for it to be a white pizza instead of red.  My recommendation is if you're hungry ... don't share. One pizza is not enough for two (order your own ... plus you can try more options when you order two!)  Diavlo has a spicy kick to it which I loved, I wish it was a little spicier.   Extra crispy is the way to go.  If you get it original the crust is crispy but when you get towards the middle you will have to use a knife and fork to eat it, or fold it in half and bite into it because it's soft in the middle.  Our friends got both the Settebello, one got the original and the other got it as a white pizza.  I definitely liked it as a white pizza.  However I am a fan of white pizzas so it might be a little biased.  With that being said, the waitress said any pizza can be a white pizza and you can add or take off anything to your liking.   Saving the best for last ... the Bella Melo pizza for dessert was delicious.  Super sweet with caramel and apples.    Overall this place was a nice place for a group of friends to get together to share pizza and have good conversations.",-1,0
Had dinner there tonight.  The other yelp reviews are accurate.  The flavor of the pizza is delicious the sauce and toppings. I enjoyed it but the crust is thin which I like. But it is soggy and doughy when u pick it up everything slides write off. My favorite thing was the insulate salad fresh green pine nuts parm cheese olives it's very tasty. They have this amazing non alcohol ginger beer and it is so yummy. I had a coast land blond on tap beer also great. I don't think I would go back very often for this pizza :( sadly the crust is too soggy. Great customer service!!!!!!! But about 8:30 they start to rush u out and gave us our check before we finished our pizza and my beer,-1,0
"Nice servers and nice atmosphere, but pizza was not bad, but not that great.  Salads were good, but they use arugula lettuce so it was bitter.  It would not be my first choice to get pizza and drinks, but if someone else wanted to go or suggested it, I would go then.  Just kinda so - so.  I have only been once so far so maybe another pizza would be better.  Not bad at all, just kinda average.",-1,0
"Had to try settobello after hearing it had come to summerlin. Pizza is very European .. Which I usually love. I felt like this pizza was almost undercooked in the middle. No real pastas on the menu either ..,sorry but If you want real pizza and pasta try dom demarcos down the street- it's amazing !",-1,0
"I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but I'm getting tired of them changing things time and time again. We have been going there since it opened and first they stopped serving sangria Italiano. Sangria is a definite must have! Then they keep changing the Misto! It use to have a great roasted zucchini and Kalamata type olive's along with the selection of meats, then a changed to an awful green olives,  now they have a awful fried eggplant and fried zucchini. Who wants more grease with the fats from the meat? The fresh selections were a much better choice! Service has been slipping a bit also..",-1,0
I walked in expecting a big place. Turns out to be a small spot for fast food . The menu is small and prices are what you expect for a restaurant in a Hotel. The kitchen is busy and have the aroma of Chinese spices cooking. And overall not a bad place to eat . However I find the same quality outside of the Silverton at less expensive price. So I give a 3 .,-1,0
"this place is inside the Silverton Casino, try the wonton noodle soup, beef chow fun, and veg. egg roll..all are good stuff, you can see the chef cooking stuff right there, it is like a fast food place, you order and pay first, then they will bring the stuff to you",-1,0
The Peking Duck stem buns were yummy but beware of bones.  The shrimp chow mein was yummy with a little char from the wok  but a little oily.  My 7 yr. old loved the won ton soup.,-1,0
I'm gonna have to go with 3 stars.    I asked for Kung Pao chicken extra spicy (I like to sweat when I eat) and chicken fried rice.    The fried rice was soggy with grease and ok flavor.   The King Pao was more like teriyaki than spicy and  once again just ok.  I am going back to try the Pho as the peeps next to us ha fit and it looked good.,-1,0
"The food was ok not great. It was just a pre-opening that the casino. The food had light tastes to them and the noodle was very oily.   I like the Shu-Mai only. The rest that they served were Pad Thai which was lacking the peanuts, the fried rice was not very tasty, stirred beef with veggies was ok but too sweet, and the pork dumplings were pretty good. Overall the service was very good but needs to work on the food.   The price was decent. It was under $15 per dish. I mean it would not be a restaurant I would like go back to. You can get better Asian food outside the casino.   The place was a little small and it was kind of odd having the tables like a bar and hard to get around, my mom said it was like a fast food restaurant. Not good for kids because they can get hurt walking under the tables. Not enough room for parties.",-1,0
"Can you say fast food restaurant style? Geez, tables open but they don't have wait service other than after you stand in an always long line to order.  Now for the food....if you are in search of ramen as I was...only 1 style to choose from. Tonkatsu ramen how can you go wrong. Very large slices of pork, lots of ramen. It's worth $ 10.00. Warms the tummy. WuHu fried rice, pork good too. Big chunks of pork, peas, carrots,onions. A $12.00 plats two could easily share. Oily though. Both dishes have that fast food oil taste to it. Shameful. Not a fan of fast food, I want to enjoy my warm soup but alas. Sitting next to a coughing, nose blowing woman is not pleasant either!",-1,0
Solid food each time I've been. Not quite the selection and flavour of say Noodle Exchange at Gold Coast but good for lunch.  Not many seats so many folks get theirs to go.,-1,0
"Orders are taken at the counter in this small restaurant, but all the food is freshly prepared. We had coupons from the American Casino Guide for free appetizers so we started with salt and pepper shrimp and crab rangoon. The shrimp should have been crispier and the rangoons should have had more crab flavor, but who can argue with the price? For entrees my wife and I shared Singapore noodles and eggplant with ground pork which were measurably better. This was way too much food so we departed with doggy bags in hand.",-1,0
"I have a hard time finding the most perfect Tom Yum in the states, so I stopped ordering it after all the failed attempts... UNTIL.... I saw it offered here on the menu. I hesitated but i went all in. I ordered the Tom Yum and it wasn't too bad. The lemongrass flavoring was perfect! I could have used a few more shrimps-- I guess shrimp is expensive and so they cut corners on cost here--- ALSO-- instead of egg noodle, be sure to ask for RICE noodle. I got a bowl of thick egg noodles, which made my soup broth disappear. I prefer rice noodles with my Tom Yum. I gave this place a 3 star only because I enjoyed the broth more so than I have ever, since coming back from Bangkok. I'm so picky about my Tom Yum... The service at Wuhu Noodle is always so friendly and efficient!!! I would recommend their pad Thai -- highest level of spicy possible. I love spicy. If it isn't spicy then it's not worth eating.",-1,0
"Great beer selection, above average cocktails, good atmosphere, but the food could use some work. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately the moules frites they served were among the worst I've ever had and this is not a dish you can mess up easily. But in this case it was decent mussels and OK fries drowned in an awful lemon soup that had enough wine in it to impart an odd alcoholic flavor. What's worse is the fries and bread arrived in this soup rendering them a bit soggy.   But there's hope! The beer and drinks are above average for Madison so as long as your primary motivation is to drink your dinner you're in luck.   Bartenders and staff are also excellent.",-1,0
"I love Cooper's - the food, the staff, the owner - but i have two peoblems with it.  1. The menu is very good but never changes.  I work practically next door to the place but i would visit now often if they would change the menu occasionally.  I doubt there had been more than a couple of changes in the last 4 years.   2.  The noise. Hard walks and floors and a crowded room make it impossible to be heard on a Friday or Saturday night.   P.S.  Really great fries!",-1,0
The steak frites looked beautiful but was so tough I didn't even bother finishing it. Me leaving asteak unfinished? That's unheard of.,-1,0

"Went to Cooper's Tavern on a Saturday night around 9 PM with friends. I guess it could have been the time of night but a couple of the items we wanted to order were out for the evening. Boo. We ended up ordering the poutine and the pretzel with cheese to start. The pretzel was good but the poutine was disappointing. Not nearly enough of the ""good stuff""  to coat the fries properly. I ordered the sweet corn Caesar as my entree thinking it sounded delicious but when the dish came I was totally disappointed. There was hardly any taste or flavor to it. I love caesar salads but this was just bland. The hard boiled egg that came on top of the salad was pink so I got a little excited thinking it would be pickled. It was not. The question still remains why was the egg pink if it wasn't pickled? My boyfriend and I also shared the french onion soup. We get french onion soup anywhere that has it on the menu, but again the broth lacked flavor. While I definitely wouldn't come here again for the food, they do have a lovely location on the capital with very nice decor! I especially liked the long booth across the entire length of the restaurant.",-1,0
"One of the more inventive menus I've seen at a tavern. The mustard sauce on the pretzel crusted chicken was delicious, but the Brussel sprouts were slightly disappointing.",-1,0
"The food at this places was very good... Alcohol prices were pretty cheap and they have a large selection of pretty much everything. The chicken sandwich was pretty good, as for the chips they were burnt. Food took forever and did not come out at the same time. Service was very slow despite being one of the 4 tables in the place. I'd go back next time I am in town, but will seat at the bar.",-1,0
"I swear to god...one of these days, Yelp will give us the option for half-stars. Until then, it's going to be three for me (whereas it would've been 3.5).   I like Cooper's. Really, I do. The food is pretty solid, and so is the beer selection. The problem? Well, it's overpriced. A lot of their beers run $5+, and while that's a bargain price in DC or NY, this is Madison, and I don't expect to pay that much. Even their specialty selection, which usually has a sour or two, is way too much. The selection is good overall, but if I want to really go all out, I'll head over to Maduro or out east to The Malthouse.   Now, the food? Well, as with most Food Fight places, it's hit or miss. Stealthily delicious hummus platter (I think it's beet hummus, but not sure), so-so sliders and so-so poutine (pronounced ""Putin"", believe it or not).   Cooper's has a really cool atmosphere, but the meh quality of the food and pricey beer list is keeping me from giving it more than 3 stars. Would I hang out there? Absolutely, as long as I didn't plan on drinking a lot.",-1,0
"Not sure about this place.  Not the best service.  I understand not wanting people, who aren't eating, to use up your tables when busy.  But when 3/4 of the place is empty - don't make it a point, when we come in, to tell us to sit at the bar.     Though the drinks were great, it took a bit too long for the bartenders to notice us.  You would think that sitting behind the beer pulls would show that we are REALLY into beer...",-1,0
"Went here after 9pm on a Saturday night. We wanted to sit outside- the place was packed inside and out, so had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Glad we sat outside though, as inside was really loud.  Awesome beer and wine selection, just about anything you could want. My friend was unhappy with his bloody mary, didn't have enough spice. We were told the kitchen closed at 10, so we had to hurry up and get our orders in. I had the brisket sandwich, which I thought lacked flavor and was pretty unimaginative. Wish I would have ordered the beef stew- it was really tasty and comfort food at its best.  The service was pretty good despite how busy the place looked. The whole experience was decent, but probably won't go out of my way to come back.",-1,0
"This place has a great atmosphere and an extensive beer list. They also have a bunch of whiskeys and bourbons. I really love the views from there seating areas. That being said, their food is often mediocre and is entirely over-priced. The best foods are the Sconnie eggs and the truffle fries. Go here to drink, not to eat.",-1,0
I went here a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed the view of the capitol building from the outdoor seating. Definitely a great place if you have people visiting for the view.   It looked like they had a pretty good selection of beverages however I did not try any this time.  I did have the Pretzel Encrusted Chicken which was just okay. By all means not horrible but it did not make me want to get it a second time if I were to return. The service was good so I don't hesitate to make another visit.,-1,0
"I'll start by saying this restaurant should have a higher rating, but for one serious mistake, which I'll get to.  Service - Excellent.  Our server was charming, knew the food & beer, fast and efficient.  Food - Fairly good.  The presentation was great, but the Poutine was just cheese fires with gravy.  Now having spent much time in Montreal, i'm a bit of a poutine purist, so perhaps I'm being a bit harsh.  Fish and chips were good, thought the fries weren't quite up to ""chip"" standards.  Drink - EXCELLENT!  What a killer beer list, and the staff knew their stuff.  Ambiance - Very good.  Maybe turn down the lights a bit.  THE BAD:   We were really enjoying the food when my friend found a BIG PIECE OF PLASTIC IN HIS BURGER.  It was the kind that patties often come wrapped in.  This was not a small piece either, it was a ball of thick, clear plastic the size of 2 peas.  My friend was very gracious and knew the cook.  He told the server to tease him about it but didn't raise a stink - didn't mention it to the owner either.  I wouldn't have been so gracious - hence the 3 star review for a 4 star place.",-1,0
"First, the space is really cool looking. It's definitely got the well-worn gastropub feel, even though it's brand new. I was really impressed with the decor, even though it isn't quite as charming as some of the other nearby establishments (though if it sticks around for a while, that will come with age). On a Friday night at around 8pm, our little twosome got right in even though I was worried that there would be a wait. We were seated near the kitchen, which meant waitresses flying around too close to my chair for comfort, but at least we got to eat soon after we arrived. We had to try the poutine, skin-on french fries with some cheese curds covered in a brown gravy (have I mentioned how my boy loves gravy?). What a tasty treat, although I think it had sat somewhere for a little bit too long because the gravy had taken on an unappealing sheen. That being said, it tasted great and the fries weren't soggy at all. This is a great alternative to cheesy bacon fries, if you're into that sort of thing. This is not health food. For our dinners I went with the reuben (with house-cured lean corn beef sliced thin, cured red cabbage, swiss cheese, and dressing on pumpernickel) and he had the burger, which was very juicy. For my side I chose the greens with house vinaigrette and he had homemade potato chips. Both of these were great, and I appreciate the lighter choice of greens (they definitely don't scrimp on portions either.. I got half a plate of romaine!). We were very satisfied with the food we'd chosen. I also got a Murphy's Irish Ale, served in a true pint glass. Our server was attentive, no complaints there. The only thing I was a bit bothered by was the beer options. While the bottle selection was just fine, I'm a draft girl and there weren't that many appealing options. Hopefully the cooper's tavern will have a rotating schedule and maybe offer this poor grad student some specials (maybe pitcher specials) so that I can continue to eat my way through the menu one weekend at a time!",-1,0
"I've been here twice: once a packed Saturday night and once a lazy Sunday afternoon. On both occasions I thought the food and service were fine. I have no complaints, but also nothing incredible to report. To be honest, the only reason I came back the second time was because I couldn't get in to Cento. It wasn't my first choice, but there were no terrible memories holding me back either.  The one thing that bugs me is that they tout having locally made bread and locally made beer, but then serve you butter from Ireland. Hello?",-1,0
"I went to Cooper's with my parents for my birthday dinner.  Walking in you are immediately impressed with the decor and the crowd packed into the narrow space. We started off with some great drinks at the bar due to the 30 minute wait at 9pm on a Saturday night.  Bartenders were friendly and prompt.  The Snoqualmie naked organic wine was particularly awesome. Beer selection adveturous and tasty.     Once we finally got seated is where the night soured a bit and the reason for the 3 stars.  Our waitress was as efficient as a broken broom. She did not deliver our food.  Not a big deal except for the fact she never once checked in on us to ask how the food was and such.  The next time we saw her after taking our order was to drop off the check after we flagged her down.  I had to verbally call her over to the table to get a new glass of wine as she was never around to cue with a simple hand gesture. Collecting her check quickly was the only skill she possessed.    However, the food was delicious. I had the pork belly mac and cheese. The way the pork flavors mixed with the mac and cheese seasonings was superb. My parents got a pair of sandwiches which were solid.    I would definitely go back simply for the beer and wouldn't mind eating there again provided I wouldn't be served by that waitress again.",-1,0
"Visited on Saturday night, so the place was hopping. The wait wasn't bad at all for that time of night, and they had a bar upstairs where we could order drinks and an appetizer while we waited. The Poutine was yummy! Unfortunately, the Pork Belly Mac was a bit bland. They do have a very extensive wine and beer list. Our service that night was friendly, but somewhat slow. After waiting for half an hour for a table, it was another 10 before we even got a menu. Overall, it was good enough that I would go again, but not amazing.",-1,0
"Went here a couple of weeks ago with my husband--we'd been meaning to try it for awhile.  We sat inside, I forget why, but in the future I think I would try to avoid it--they have this set-up with a long bench along the wall, tables, and chairs on the facing side, which gives it more of a fast food feel than I really like, plus the tables are TINY.  I felt like I was being squashed into people on both sides of me, and it was noisy.  We split an order of chips (fries) before the meal, and they were AMAZING.  Really well done, just the right texture for me (relatively thin for home-made chips, but still just a little soft like I like them, not too many burnt ones), and they came with a DELICIOUS vinegar-infused aoli for dipping.  Husband had some beer that he really liked, and obviously that's their main deal.  I had some wine and it was okay, but I remember thinking that the selection was pretty thin.  I realize it's not their primary thing, but it could have had a little more variety.  For the entree, I had the grilled cheese with a ""shot"" of their Harvest Tomato soup.  I didn't realize when I ordered that they LITERALLY meant a ""shot""--like, it was served in a shot glass, which was INCREDIBLY inconvenient since it was nearly impossible to dip the sandwich in it, even shredded into small pieces.  What do they think people DO with grilled cheese and tomato soup?!  The container really needed a broader mouth, even if it had held the same volume.  The soup was really good--very flavorful, just a hint of spice, very nice.  The server also said she THOUGHT that it was vegan, although she couldn't confirm--she said the chef likes to do vegan stuff when he can.  The grilled cheese, though, was really disappointing.  The menu listed three kinds of cheese, including cheddar, but it just had no flavor at ALL.  Totally bland.  I'd have been happier with a full bowl of the soup.  If you don't like to be crowded, I'd recommend trying to sit outside in the next few months rather than inside.  And avoid the grilled cheese.",-1,0
"I had a pleasant experience at Cooper's Tavern. I was with three other people and was seated right away.  The food was delicious. We got two appetizers (beer cheese pretzels and croquettes) and it was a good choice since both appetizers didn't have a lot of food with them.  I had the sliders for my main course and it was the perfect size. I was stuffed by the end of the meal.  The overall experience was ok. It is very dark and REALLY loud, but they had a nice selection of food and drinks and everyone seemed to be content.",-1,0
"Okay Cooper's, I want to be friends with you. There is so much potential here ready to be unleashed, and I want to be there when you do. Unfortunately, there are a few glaring issues that prevent me from truly being your friend or your BFF. Let's keep talking to see how it goes, and we can consider a relationship later.  We visited Cooper's on a weeknight for a bite to eat and to meet with a friend. We opted to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. First off, your view of the Capitol building is amazing. Second off, why do you have customers share tables? I mentioned in my Pig in a Fur Coat review that normally this is an awkward experience. Cooper's, it was awkward. I want my own table and to not share the paper pushing discussion of the two coworkers getting a bite after work.  Cooper's has a very solid beer list. If there isn't something on tap they have listed because you're ""that person,"" (no worries, I'm sometimes ""that person too"" so don't feel bad), there will be at least 5 beers available in bottle that you will craze. Cooper's has you covered.  There were no cheese curds on the menu... I don't know how that is possible, but it was. I guess Cooper's isn't trying to be Old Fashioned too hard!  Since cheese curds were out of the option we ordered pretzels with a Guinness sauce as an appetizer. Major props on the sauce guys. Anyone can make a soft-pretzel well, but most people will serve it with garlic sauce or cheese product. While I may enjoy those at a sporting event, I want something more for dinner. Your sauce works, it's awesome. I want it bottled.  Now here is where it gets awkward. I ordered the lobster mac n' cheese for dinner. It was $19, and I was expecting something solid because we're in Wisconsin so ordering a dinner based around cheese is a no brainer. It wasn't good, guys. I was greatly let down by this dish, and I do not think it should sit on the menu for $19 or exist at all.   The lobster was overcooked and chewy. I could barely taste the cheese. It's mac n CHEESE, Cooper's! I know you probably got distracted in the grocery store by that bottle of truffle oil and forgot to buy enough cheese but come on! It's unfortunate that the primary ingredients didn't deliver. Well, at least the pasta was cooked properly.   Back to the truffle oil, why? I know you think you're Alinea, but you're not. Truffle oil is gimmicky and it makes everything else taste like truffle oil. It absolutely overpowered every single other ingredient in the food, which is a HUGE problem when you are serving lobster. Lobster is ridiculously easy to out flavor with other ingredients. Let the lobster shine, guys. It's the feature of the dish!  The entree did come with a salad. The ingredients were crispy and the dressing was delicious. I think I enjoyed the salad more than the main feature.  Service was about what I expect. Drinks were topped off, we were asked how everything was. It was nothing exceptional or disappointing. Kudos!  Cooper's, I want to like you, and I appreciate many things about you, but that one dish was executed so poorly that I cannot look past it. Let's continue to hang out with other people, but we can keep our options open. If we do hang out, please don't bring Dave, the lobster mac n cheese with you. No one likes Dave.",-1,0
"I probably built this place up in my mind too much before I ended up here. It's been awhile since I've been to Canada and I've been having a craving for poutin. After consulting Yelp I found this place as somewhere in the US I might go for my fix. Since I had a business trip planned to Milwaukee it wasn't much more of a drive to get to Madison. I figured if there was a place outside of Ontario or Quebec to get good poutin it had to be Wisconsin, home of the cheese curd. So on a rainy afternoon I headed to Madison. The first bringdown about this place is its location so close to the capital. Trying to park anywhere near Cooper's is a pain. And when it's raining it's even worse. Having finally found parking I then ran in the rain to get to the restaurant. I get in, am immediately seated and get a menu. A big positive  for the place is its beer selection. I was able to get a draft of a California beer I like cheaper there than when I am in California. I ordered poutin and sliders from the menu. The poutin came out first and my heart sank after seeing it. It was made with YELLOW cheese curds and the gravy was like a light brown sausage gravy. Most horrible. EVERYBODY knows poutin is made with WHITE cheese, mozzarela, montery jack or even cheddar, and a thick BROWN gravy. Broke my heart when it came out. The taste wasn't much better. The gravy and fries were barely warm so the cheese couldn't melt which made the whole thing an unappetizing mess. The sliders weren't bad but I hadn't come for the sliders. After eating I trudged back to my car in the rain. Pricewise not bad for beer but a bit pricey for the quality (or lack thereof) of the food. 3 stars for the good beer price.",-1,0
"If Coopers wasn't on the Capitol square, no one would go to it. This is the most overrated place in town. I've been several times and every time it's packed and the food is mediocre. Don't expect to be able to have a conversation with just your dining companion(s) because the tables are so close to each other you're all practically eating together. I think we're supposed to think that's charming. I just find it irritating. We went last week before a show at the Overture. My brisket sandwich was dry and over-cooked and The Boyfriend's pork chop was similarly dry and overdone. What a bummer. Good beer selection and the Belgian frites were ok (though under-salted and putting aoli in a shot glass is not really attractive...), but we won't be back anytime soon.",-1,0
"Went to this restaurant on the day after thanksgiving when all of our first choices were closed. We got in, and while seated right away, took 15 minutes and us asking the waitress 3 times before we even got water. The couple that came in 30 min after us got food and drinks before us. The service was poor, and slow. The food was just okay.   Edited on 3/11/12 - gave it a second chance - raised it to 3 stars instead of two. This time is was much, much better service, but still 'good/okay' food. I do have to say, I was more impressed with the beer list this time. I'd consider going again for drinks.",-1,0
"Meh...it was okay. Nothing bad on their part...their style of pizza is just not my cup of tea. I prefer a thicker crust. Not bad. Just not the best pizza I've had in my life...I likely will not be going out of my way for a follow-up visit but if a group of friends wanted to visit again, I wouldn't be opposed.",-1,0
Pros: Server was amazing Super clean  Fast and hot  Smells amazing  Crushed Ice!!!!    Cons: Awful Pizza $19 for a small pizza with one topping  Greasy and Soggy They don't have pepperoni ...just salami  No lunch specials,-1,0
This place was very unique.  I had the Margarita Pizza.  It was pretty good. The ambience and location next to the movie theater was great.  I would recommend this place for a nice dinner.,-1,0
It was a family night and I've been dying to try Settebello for the longest time and it just so happened I saw that there was one close to us. Away we went and we walked in and they had said they couldn't take credit card at that moment but luckily we had enough cash money to pay for the tab.  We started off with the buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto. It came with a pizza size bread type thing as well which was a little burnt. The mozzarella was delish and it went well with everything. I ordered the Bianca. I wasn't too impressed with it and since it was such a thin crust it got soggy pretty quickly. My husband ordered the Capricciosa. We weren't blown away by that either.   Overall service wasn't the quickest and most attentive (waited for more napkins for a good 10 minutes or so) but the credit card machine was back in working order. I wasn't too impressed and I'm not sure I'll be back when there's a lot of pizza places that I do love around! Sorry Settebello!,-1,0
"With the recommendation of my sister, I tried this place for lunch today. I ordered the Emilia pizza while my beau ordered the Vico. Service was fairly on point and ambience was very casual. It was not busy at all since it was a weekday and so service was quick. The pizzas were good, fresh ingredients and a good size. However, overall it was good, not great. The crust was a little bit softer than I would like and it seemed like it lacked seasoning. Would I come back? probably would but I would try to go to other pizzerias I've had around the area.",-1,0
"You get a 3 because you're service is inconsistent. When Al's there, great, otherwise, Eh. Pizza is great when the Neapolitans are working. Hemingway on the rocks is a delicious cocktail. I've stolen it off you. Thanks.",-1,0
Absolutely terrible service. They had 2 waiters for the entire restaurant and even had the buss boy serving. The food was good but the service definitely takes away from it....very understaffed.,-1,0
"Cool decor, the service wasn't really good for start we order just water and soda but my friend ordered a beer in a wine glass (she is very picky) our server said there was a problem with the beer and he will get as soon as possible. About 10 minutes later we forgot who our server was. Finally the beer came but not in a bear glass not a wine glass. The food made up for that though it was really fresh and tasty.",-1,0
"With all the fantastic pizza places here, I can't help but base my rating off ratings I've given to other pizza spots. This was our first visit to this location and my rating is probably closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I didn't think our experience was worth 4 stars.   We were seated quickly and ordered the meatballs and capricciosa pizza. The meatballs were just ok, a little bland without the sauce, but the bread that accompanied it was good. In theory I liked all of the ingredients in the pizza - artichoke, prosciutto, olives, mushrooms, mozzarella, basil. What's not to like? But together, it didn't really work. I think if they used black olives instead of kalamata and chopped the artichoke hearts a bit smaller (instead of huge chunks), and added more mushrooms and prosciutto, it would've been 10 times better. I do like the thin crust and cooking it in a wood fired oven gives it a rustic flavor.  Service was decent, not great, not terrible. We probably won't be going back anytime soon though :/",-1,0
"visited Settebello yesterday for a to-go lunch order.  I went with the ""settebello"" pizza ($13.50) - sausage, pancetta, mushrooms and pine nuts.  After ordering, walked down to Rocket Fizz to pick-up a few ""artisan"" sodas.  Returned just in time to pick up pizza and go my way.  I felt the pizza was undercooked - very slight charring on the top of the pizza crust,  The mozzarella was not melted, a boatload of pine nuts, yet very light on mushroom..  Still, the flavors were there - especially liked the sausage and the pancetta.  I'm hoping this is simply a "" working out the kinks"" situation yet I wonder since at the time I entered the restaurant, I only saw 3 customers - what happens when there are 30 customers ???  I'll return",-1,0
"Definitely loved the atmosphere and interior of this restaurant! If I walked into this restaurant, I wouldn't think it would be a place where pizza was served. I would recommend this place for couples and or family dinners.   Unfortunately, I did not really enjoy the food. We ordered the settebello and carbonara pizzas and it was just alright. You can definitely taste the difference between their pizza and a regular pizza from papa john's, I'll give them that, but I wasn't in love with it. We also ordered the cannoli and it was meh.",-1,0
"This place used to be one of my favorites, but the last time I was there, it was pretty disappointing. The menu was much smaller than it used to be, and an old favorite (Cobb Caesar) was subpar: salty, rubbery chicken, not as many vegetables, smaller portion overall and no presentation. I hope they improve soon!",-1,0
"Had breakfast here this morning. I had the eggs Benedict. Yummy, but had to send it back once because my eggs had runny whites. Yuck! The second time around they were perfect. Yummy! Ham too thick, but still tasty. Super yummy homemade english muffin. Rustic to say the least.",-1,0
"I will start by saying there is much to like about this restaurant from a location and aesthetics standpoint.  It really drew us in.  The night we ate there, it was really busy and we sat outside with a view of the capitol.  We were kind of forgotton about and had to wait a really long time for all of our food.  I am gluten free and this is the main reason I am writing this review.  I find reviews of how restaurants handle those who eat this way, for whatever reason, so helpful.  This restaurant has a GF menu (I have celiac) which was a huge bonus.  However my soup which I ordered off the GF menu came out with a huge slice of sourdough laying on the soup spoon.  Not a huge deal to get another spoon but made me nervous as to how aware they really were.  Then the wait for our entrees took so long I had to leave with my 2 year old daughter because she had run out of patience.  I am sure it is great on less busy nights, but we weren't able to enjoy the experience that night.",-1,0
"I usually love this restaurant. Tonight though, the kids' meals left much to be desired. The skewered chicken, while abundant, was very dry. My daughter tried to eat it.   I guess I thought my Brussels sprouts salad would be a warm addition of pan seared sprouts. It was only okay.   At least we started with my fav, the frites with the vinegar mayo. Love. Love. Love.   I think the kids meals need work. My kids won't want it again.   Service was excellent as always.",-1,0
I am never super impressed with the taste of the food.  The last time I went I got a grilled chicken sandwich and it was the texture of a chicken patty.,-1,0
"I was very excited to try coops, many of my work friends had tried it and had nothing but good things to say. With that in mind I went in with rather high expectations.  I ordered the Salmon Lox brunch, which consists of chive eggs (A+), and salmon with some bread. The salmon is where my experience kinda fell through, I'm no fish conissour or expert but everywhere I've ordered salmon smoked or grilled it's been served warm, this salmon came to me cold as I'm sure was the chefs intention but nowhere or the menu nor did the waiter state it would be cold, this was a big letdown. The portion size was also small given little slivers of salmon but that wasn't a surprise consider it was only $10  The waiters were attentive and friendly. Despite this mediocre experience I'm optimistic that the place has more to offer and can redeem itself.",-1,0
"The meals are a-ok but some wines that I'd see in wine shops on the drink menu are a bit over price or just a half full glass. So one day while here in Madison, My Brazilian friend Jessica and I went there for dinner and the one thing that did help the place was the service for the host at the door making some room for the two of us. I can't recall his name by he was a very nice guy and hope he is get an better position there soon. But when he ask us after we sat down what he can get us, we explain to him what we wanted and he told the waiter our drinks orders and that is where it took a turn for slow and confuse waiter service. The waiter after 10 minutes came to our table and ask what can I start you with? By the way it was a male not female waiter, and I reply back and told him we already order when the Host told you our drinks. Then he realize our drinks have been sitting at the bar for a while now. The beer was so so flat and the red was good doe Jessica. Now when it come to food, not a fan of the mussels I've eaten, some of the mussels under-cook and some felt like there were over cooked. Not sure they mix one order with another because they do that kind of thing in a kitchen to make up time. But speaking of time, food times were about 20 minute wait for there was a couple sitting next to us that were there before us just waiting on their food and we got our food first. This is the reason why I said someone mix overcooked mussels with undercooked mussels. But back to the story, as  I was saying before, we got our food first then they didn't receive their food until 10 minutes after we received our dinner which means the same waiter can't handle pressure in a fast moving restaurant. Jessica and I felted so bad and was concern about food because she wasn't really happy with the quality of food and I wasn't either but trial and error right. But I'd tip over 25% to the service but that doesn't mean I did that for the waiter. he was slow and only return to our table just twice, one to order food and once we had our meal finish to ask us how was the food and I spoke the truth. So So this can use more of this and that. So I went the next time with a friend to see the difference in food and time to see if there was another cook in the kitchen to try something out and it was difference after eating the salmon and it was delicious and much less wait time and it was still busy. I just didn't want that say waiter again.  So is it a good place to bring your other half or your family? Well Family I am not so sure but friend, wife, girlfriend or partner? I would say yes and no because it just depend on your mood and taste. It's up to you",-1,0
"I tried the pork belly mac.  It was just ok.  I had a very small piece of pork belly and it was very fatty, I couldn't really eat it.  The mac and cheese sauce is more like alfredo sauce... not what I expected.  A good beer selection though.",-1,0
"Pros: Great big beer selection, really nice servers, attempt at a true Irish Pub feeling.  Great location on the square, with nice outdoor dining. The menu is a big hit for many, but not me.  Cons: It is hard to get a table, it is extremely loud, and the eclectic meal combinations do not always work.    I've been to Coopers a half dozen times, and always want to like it more.  I find the food is not what I thought I was ordering, and I am jammed into a small space at I table I've waited for too long to be seated at.  I will give it another try.",-1,0
"I was here a few weeks ago, and had an overall good experience.  I had a Reuben sandwich which was done pretty well.  Perhaps on the smaller side of things, but good.  I had greens on the side, which were alright.  I also had a bloody mary, which was very good.  Served with a side of beer, Wisconsin style.  The rest of my companions had good experiences as well.  We were seated in a little private room next to the bar which made the experience pretty unique.",-1,0
"I was really excited when the Coopers Tavern opened, but after a few visits, I'm a touch underwhelmed. However, they still have fairly good food and beers at a convenient location (with a beautiful view of the Capitol, I might add), so while I don't crave it, I'll probably return for beers and a bit every now and then.  The interior is really small, crowded, and loud. I purposely avoid the place when they have live Irish music because it's completely deafening and makes it impossible to talk to anyone. There's often a line on busy nights, and there isn't much room inside for it to grow, so I avoid it more during the winter. In the spring and summer, there's a large, pleasant outdoor patio, which is a significantly more enjoyable area to have a meal and drinks. The bathrooms are clean and well-stocked. If you're going with a group of friends, see if you can use the snug; it's like a tiny bar-within-a-bar that's walled-in and much quieter with seating for up to about 8 people. There's a tiny window that opens onto the bar, making it really easy to place drink orders with a bartender. It's a much more pleasant experience. I notice that their website says they've opened up the second floor Thursday-Saturday 4:30-midnight when there isn't a private event, so maybe this will help with the crowding and noise issues.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu. They're prompt and attentive, and make sure to check that you're enjoying your food and drinks. Nothing but kudos all around for those guys.  The tap beer list is seasonally rotated and extensive; it's full of great beers from local microbreweries as well as some other not-so-local yet delicious beers. The bottle beer list is as long as my arm and full of some fantastic choices. I haven't had wine or mixed drinks here, though; the beer selection is always too tempting to pass up. The food is really hit-or-miss. The Belgian frites with malt vinegar aioli are crispy and hot with a good hit of salt, and the aioli is a perfect compliment of acidity with a smooth edge. The poutine, although very salty, is a great winter dish, but far too heavy for a summer evening. The roasted bone marrow is extremely rich. The overriding taste is just pure fattiness. I like fat as much as the next person, but I had to ask for more bread because it's difficult to eat in large quantities at once. It works better as a shared dish. The mussels du jour are a crap shoot, since they are prepared differently every day. I steer clear of the days when they're steamed in beer (especially Guinness), because they taste extremely sour to me. They used to also have a chips and chicken curry plate, which I loved, but it seems to have been taken off the menu.  Overall, if I'm in the area and it isn't too busy, it's worth the occasional stop, but with so many other good restaurants in the vicinity, it's definitely not an overriding favorite.",-1,0
"Came here for lunch, it was very crowded. The tables are small and very close together so you can hear all the conversations around you. The lunch menu was pretty small just maybe 7 appetizers, 10 entrees (all sandwiches and burgers), and some soup/salads.  The price was pretty fair for lunch (~10 + tip) I got the wagyu sliders because I've been wanting to try wagyu beef but honestly.. its alright.. I like the bun which is pretzel and it came with a salad with vingrette dressing.  My friend got the chicken with chips and the portion was huge with that.  overall, food was okay (a bit greasey) and the environment was alrite but too crowded. I didn't try the beer or drinks because it was lunch. but overall it was alrite.",-1,0
"Service was quick and after a moment, friendly. Great beer selection. I got Amy's salad to go. Though it said it came with balsamic vinegraitte, when I got back to my hotel, it was a mustard, garlic, truffle creamy dressing. For me, that worked out even better.",-1,0
"Had heard a lot about this place, but was not that good. Outdoor seating seemed exciting because of capital view but seats were uncomfortable with no back support and kept bouncing when someone got up. It was a busy day so service was not good! They undercooked our burger and had to overdo (never asked us how we like it in the first place). You can probably guess how much extra we had to wait!  Quality of burger was low!  The only good part was the dessert! We loved the creme brÃ»lÃ©e!",-1,0
"Food and beer is excellent, staff leaves something to be desired. Coopers is always crowded and noisy, but it's easy to ignore when the food is amazing. Beer menu is unparalleled in Madison. However something I cannot look past is the inconsiderate staff. If the owner is around, the service is great. If he's not, the hostess forgets about you for 40 minutes. The last time we went, we were told there were no tables available and we had to sit at the table or bar. But there were two tables in front and two smaller tables in back completely open. Our waiter was incompetent and wandered around while simultaneously forgetting some of my food.  What gives, Coopers? Get it together.",-1,0
"We probably won't come back here for dinner, but definitely for drinks. Great selection and very cheap! (well, to us from the Bay Area ...) I really loved the Fox Barrel Pear Blackberry cider and Derek loved the New Glarus Raspberry.  We started off with the pretzels + beer cheddar dip ... How was that so bland? But indeed, it was, and completely unforgettable.  Derek got a burger and I got a grilled veggie sandwich. Pretty yummy but not special. We left still hungry, but at least a little tipsy!",-1,0
"I like this place for its brunch menu more than its pub scene. It's one of the better ones I've seen.   I'm a fan of Cooper's Tavern's eggs benedict, salmon crepe, quiche, and banana bread french toast. I'm positive the other items on their brunch menu are great as well, but I haven't tried them all. Their poutine is pretty legit and the bloody mary definitely helps jump start the day.  Don't hesitate; drop by for brunch instead of the usual.",-1,0
"So - I've been yelping for quite a while and have never written a review. Not cool - I know. Never too late to start! My husband and I biked to Cooper's Tavern as we've passed it several times while at the Farmer's Market on the Square (which you have to definitely check out if you haven't yet)! We were... disappointed.   Ambience - really really cute, very nice on the eyes.   But the food- mediocre. Do not get the beer cheese pretzels - they're like breadsticks, more than anything else. I got the goat cheese polenta - the veggies were doused in grilling oil and the polenta was... nothing special. My husband got the special- lamb tartine which was good, not great.   If anything - Cooper's Tavern is a good place to go for a drink and their fries - which were fantastic! I don't think we'd bother trying anything else on the menu. :(",-1,0
"My normal hair dresser couldn't get me in for a while, so I tried some place different. My colorist did a great job and the cut was done well. My only complient is the bill. I can't believe how expensive they are for cut and color. My mouth almost dropped when they told me the total. Also it took them over 3 hours to highlight and cut my hair which seemed a little long.   I would go back, but won't be a regular on the prices they charge for hair.",-1,0
"I got the Specialty Pedicure and she did a great job, and I highly recommend the pedicures there.   However, I've realized that next time I make an appointment for a pedicure someplace, I need to ask about the atmosphere.  Because part of the reason I get them, along with the leg massage, is to relax.  She had relaxing aromatherapy oils that were fantastic for me to try.  But the music was so loud, I just couldn't really enjoy the pedicure.  He did turn it down a bit after a while... but there are people walking around, and it's just loud because it's a salon, after all... noise can't be avoided.",-1,0
This place has a great first time customer deal to try out the services I went with a haircut and I was very pleased. I returned afterwards a couple of times but I felt that overall it was too expense for a haircut and moved on. It is a very nicely decorated salon and great location on mill.,-1,0
"Free haircut! Yeah!   I love my haircut! I donated my hair to Locks of Love, so I got the cut for free.   I colored my hair dark brown for $90, but it still looks black to me. I can see the brown color in the sun, but it looks the same indoors. I wish I had done a more dramatic red instead. I have buyers remorse, I guess.   I'm uploading my pictures so you can see the difference before and after.",-1,0
"This is a very nice, clean, friendly salon. The ambiance is cozy and I thought the Aveda tea was a nice touch....even if it was in a dixie cup. My stylist, on the other hand, did not have such a nice touch. She was sweet and seemed talented enough since she had put herself together nicely. My hair appointment was for a color melt meaning I wanted to get my hair the ombre look. When I began to explain to her how I wanted my ends lighter and the pieces framing my face to be brighter she seemed to understand what I meant. I said the slightest detail about how I didnt want to be to contrasting (like drew barrymore's ombre) and she immediately told me that I needed some color on top, to mix in but at the same time not look like I got highlights. This sounded good to me but I wanted to be remind her I didnt want to die my grow out on top (that had taken FOREVER to get to my natural color). She assured me she knew what I meant but thatd she brighten me up....  and she definitely did. I left there looking like I left my ends dipped in bleach and my roots highlighted like a frosty mini-wheat. I hate causing a fuss but I am so tired of salons talking me out of what I came there for. I also ended up paying an extra $30 compared to the amount they quoted me when I made my appointment. Overall, I don't HATE my hair, it's just not what I wanted. Now I'll have to wait for my roots to grow to achieve my desired look even though I paid a hefty price for that. I won't be returning to this salon.",-1,0
Used my Livingsocial coupon with no problems. Cupcakes were good but don't think they are worth the regular price. Disappointed that they only had a few selections of cupcakes in store in the afternoon. Maybe about 4-5 plain looking varieties. They also did not have any macaroons on display or mini cupcakes or cookies. Don't know if these has to be special ordered. I totally forget that they're suppose to offer other goodies than cupcakes. Apparently they didn't since I did not see anything else on display!!  Got 9 cupcakes for $24 - you do the math. Probably not return....,-1,0
"$2.50 for a regular cupcake which is mini size in other places,  I can just eat it in a bite?  I have to say that Crumbs and Co definitely on the pricey side...  Chocolate Strawberry Filling cupcake was so delicious!! Moist and flavoured and regrettable small.... Great if you are on a diet.. you really need to savoy every single bite!  Staffs are nice and friendly.... and I guess I have to go back and try out other flavour!",-1,0
"We stopped by here specifically for the poutine.  The place itself felt like the kind of neighborhood joint with a bunch of regulars and fun, wisecracking staff.  Judging from the interactions between the customers and the waiters/cooks, that's exactly what it was.    The poutine was good, very rich, and no doubt ranks highly as far as poutine goes in the city.  However, for the four or five bucks that it ran us, I was kind of hoping for something more.  Also, it came with an olive for some reason.  PECULIAR",-1,0
"I had heard a lot about this place's poutines from friends and finally tried them last night. I found the food unimpressive. Their poutine with peppers, mushrooms and onions had all the vegetables raw (you'd think they might sautee or fry the mushrooms a little, or at least the green peppers?). If you're on the Main and looking for a quick bite, it'll do, but I wouldn't go out of my way for their food.",-1,0
"I heard that the fries were awesome, and reading from previous reviews that the poutine was a MUST!  You have to have great fries to have great poutine, I think! So during my visit to Montreal, I kept bugging my husband that we had to stop by Patati Patata so I could try their ""classique"" poutine.    I agree with other reviewers - this place is really cramped and not for the claustrophobic.  The place seats only 13 people max and it is not a place where you want to bring your kids.  It is definitely more for take out.  You need to know exactly what you want, otherwise you'll have the cashier and cook saying unpleasant things in french under their breath. It happened to my friend, when she wanted to know what another customer was having.  They just want you to give a straight order. The wait is incredibly long with the line out the door so be prepared to wait at least 20 mins.  Overall, i really enjoyed the poutine! The thin cut fries, meaty gravy, and cheese were just the right amount to complement one another.  I don't like it when there's too much gravy that is makes the fries soggy within the first minutes and it becomes a think bowl of muck. However, the portion seemed rather small for the price that I paid and in comparison to other places that serve poutine.  If the portion had been bigger I would have definitely given it 4 stars.",-1,0
"Classic greasy spoon in the mile-end. I tried their poutine, and it was just okay. Powder type gravy, fresh cheese and fries, topped with a completely useless olive. Poutine tasted fine, it looked fine, but it's not all that different in quality or composition than any other greasy spoon you'll find around. At least it was just $5.   This place is a lot more about the location (on St-Laurent, near the parcs) and the vibe (tiny old school Quebec diner) than the food. That's okay, just not worth repeat visits unless you're going to become a regular.  Tip: if you can get one of the two person tables by the north facing windows - it totally changes the experience. A very nice spot to people watch on St-Laurent & Rachel.",-1,0
"A TINY local place, the servings seem to be proportionate to the size of the restaurant.  The burgers may be small, but they are great!  Just order a few of them if you're hungry.  Fries are solid and the beer is much cheaper than many other places I've seen in Montreal.  Not a great place for a date, but a good bet if you're in the mood for some burgers and fries with plenty of local beer!",-1,0
"Have not tried the poutine.  The fries are good but on the thin and dark side and does not seem like it'd stand up well against gravy.  Willing to go try the poutine if the schedule frees up a little next time  ""In terms of higher end stuff, Patati Patata is my favourite.""",-1,0
"Finally, I went to Patati Patata and tried their Poutine.   Since I am a loyal Poutine lover and big fan, I gotta say that It wasn't THAT good.. I mean yes it was good gravy and good cheese ....but I expected BETTER! when you look at the fires, you can tell they're not really good and in a good shape!  I didn't find the Poutine better than any regular resto I usually try...  The staff were really nice and friendly, and as always the place was packed! I ended up eating my poutine on the bench on Rachel Street in front of  PP. (wasn't a very smart thing to do, you know""cough"" homeless will keep sticking around ""cough"" )  After all, Patati Patata was good but not great!",-1,0
"After a gruesome walk, my boyfriend and I needed food in our stomach. We came across this retro and bright colored corner shop and decided to give it a shop. A diner that usually serves locals gave us a totally different feel. The atmosphere was homey and the waiter which also act as the chef was nice and talked to us like he knew us for decades.  I saw the menu and was thinking how can a burger at a diner cost as little as $2-3. So, not knowing how the burger will come out we chose to get poutine. The fries were just alright but the gravy was heavily salted. I had trouble finishing my dish. Maybe the burger would be friendlier next time.",-1,0
"I had their regular poutine and I didn't like it too much. The gravy was sour (not that it went bad or anything) because of the olives. I loved the atmosphere of the store though, it's really small but they're really quick to serve you since the seats are limited. Many people get a takeout here because of that. But the rotation is so quick that we found seats quite immediately. Overall, it didn't make a lasting impression on me, especially in terms of the food quality.",-1,0
"Tiny little hole-in-the-wall joint with maybe 6 bar stools + 4 small tables.  Poutine is the specialty, but lots of other stuff on the menu.  Only 2 guys working, and with a line usually out the door, you have to be patient.  I mean these guys are working their cojones off, and still maintain a pleasant demeanor even though they don't have time to catch their breath.  Food prices are cheap, and a 10 ounce draft beer is a very reasonable $2.50.",-1,0
"Just a warning, you will never be able to sit down. ever. Comfort aside, this place is great, vegan and vegetarian friendly, good ethics, cute spot. Really nice in the summer to stop in and get a snack, then eat in the park across the street. There is a lot of pushing, complaining and long lines at PatatiPatata, but that's only because it's good. Everyone gets served...eventually.",-1,0
"Not bad. Good value for money, but wouldn't be running back. We tried a burger, a fish burger and a tofu burger.  Tofu burger was an interesting concept but didnt thrill me. The best was the fish burger.",-1,0
"The restaurant is small but good. All the staff were very friendly and price was reasonable. I just ordered one classic poutine to go. The food was made freshly and gravy was hot enough to melt the cheese curd. However, it seemed to be a little salty for me. Maybe it was not my dish. I preferred some kind of creative-style poutine~ I found that many customers chosen their burger. It looks good too.",-1,0
Had a Great time ! The place was small lots of ppl quick service Staff is friendly Nice spot to eat with friends and kill time,-1,0
"The congested space makes it difficult to devour a hearty poutine, otherwise take-outs don't sound bad.",-1,0
"After trying to eat here for a few times, I finally got into the restaurant without having to lineup outside.  I got a bacon cheese burger and poutine for 11 something dollars, which is ok pricing.  The burger had the size of a slider. You know the little round bread you get in big packages at costco? Yeh, I fear that is the bread they use. The meat patty fit well into the bun, which means it's probably the size of a 1.59$ mcdonald's hamburger patty.   Except, it was well cooked and tasty. So...it's kind of worth the 2.75$ basic burger + 0.65$ cheese + 0.65$ bacon? You tell me.  When I inquired about the poutine, two ladies at the counter vouched for it. The portion was ok, just enough to keep me interested throughout (I get bored real quick). The gravy was very salty, but had a particular taste (that I can't seem to place, probably because of the beer I had priorly), perhaps mushroom based, which differentiates it from a generic gravy. There was a bit too much cheese however, in terms of proportion. My last bites mainly consisted of unmelted cheese. But it does go 'squeak squeak' when I chew hahaha.  I'm not a particular fan of their fries, which is sad to say, because I'd assume a restaurant calling itself 'Patati Patata' would have a great potato recipe. They were crispy but brown (gives off a bitter taste) on the outside and thinly cut so the resulting fries are rather dry (not enough of interior fluffy content).  Purely in terms of taste, I'd give 4/5 for the burger, 3/5 for the poutine.   Can someone, who's not a tourist eating poutine for the first time, explain to me what I am missing out?",-1,0

"OK smallish casino with good service and decent enough machines.  We thought it was just OK the 15 minutes we spent there, nothing special, not unlike Ellis Island or some Fremont Street Casinos.",-1,0
"I bought the Casino Guide 2013 and they have a BOGO entree at their grille restaurant. We came on a Saturday evening and ordered  1. Chicken fettuccine, 14.99 2. Chicken Marsala, 14.99 for $19.20   - Easy parking. For a Saturday night, they still have plenty of parking around the back of the casino.  - Rey was a really nice server. Very happy.  - The entree comes with soup or salad. We both chose the soup, which was the all potato with bacon and cheese. Honestly, the bacon made the soup really salty, but it wasn't too bad. It came with a side of saltine chips! Haha.  - I enjoyed the Chicken fettuccine. The noodles tasted delicious, but the chicken was a bit tough. They did provide a generous portion. Enough to probably feed 2!  - The chicken marsala was also not too tender. The sauce was liquidy, basically drowned the dish. It also needed to be a bit more savory. I did like the sauteed mushrooms. I wouldn't recommend it.  - Overall, they give good portions, but without a coupon for dinner, I don't think I'd come back.   Casino - So many penny slots!  - They had a raffle going this night, and it was a chance to win up to $10k.  - They were also giving out free vanilla ice cream over chocolate and whip cream near the rewards desk. Excellent way to finish the course meal.  - If you can tolerate the smoke, then you can really make your gambling urge last.  - If you're under 30, then you are the outlier.",-1,0

"One of the only casinos I know of that offers free food for holidays! We loved the New  Years Eve spread which also included desserts! They also have free food throughout the week and a number of rotating gaming promos. Be warned, this is one of the smokiest casinos I've been in.",-1,0
"I saw a sign publicizing a breakfast special of 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon and 2 pancakes for $2.22 at the entrance to the creatively named Emerald Island Grille that we ordered knowing neither of us would be able to clean our plates.    Considering the locale and clientele, our meals turned out to be better than expected and, at that price, a definite steal, but when I received our check it was priced at $3.99 each. I brought the mistake to the cashier's attention and after much back and forth followed by my re-checking the sign, I realized the name of the special was 2-2-2, not the price.  Oh my, sometimes it ain't easy being a senior.    A rating of 2.5 would be more appropriate.",-1,0
"On one of my ""vagabond days"", I tasted, compulsively, the cafeteria food at J-Town. The Nori was crunchy, fresh, light and tasty despite the strong and almost pungent vinegar. The food court had a factory-like ambiance and seemed like it was in the middle of a warehouse. In other words, not so posh. The sushi, a refrigerated takeout tray, was tasty and definitely more ""authentique"" than any other cafeteria-inspired quicky sushi.",-1,0
"Much smaller than I thought. But this place has a really warm welcoming vibe.  Those dishes and treats on the counter didn't really attract me, so I Went to the cafe and ordered mushroom pasta.  Well, not bad but nothing special. The pasta is kind of hard, I prefer it boiling longer. The sauce is creamy , but salty. What disappoint me is that the flavor just stop at ""salty"". Nothing impressive. Their salad is good though. Really fresh.",-1,0
"Whenever I feel as though I need to transport myself back to Japan, I go to J-Town.  And invariably I end up disappointed.  When this place first opened, it was awesome.  I don't know if businesses have moved away, but its not the same.  Even the grocery store (Heisei) does not carry the same variety they used to.  The fishmonger (Sakana) is incredible and on the same level as Taro freshness-wise.  No worries in that department.  J-Town has so much potential - but the vibe is tired and jaded ...",-1,0
"Homemade Japanese meals but charges a bit too much. Good bakery items but costly as well. You can most Japanese groceries not available in Chinese supermarkets, but with a cost. Sushi place is too stinky to get closer but take-out party trays with good quality of fishes. In general, it is an expensive place but you are guaranteed it is real Japanese food.",-1,0
"I was all excited to visit J-Town until I got there and realized that there must be something lost in translation there since ""town"" in Japanese must mean 4 stores?   And I use the word ""store"" lightly since really there were only two stores: one was a little cubby selling some authentic Japanese imports including tabi socks which I grabbed and onigiri molds, the other is a cosmetic store that has some fashions, and books (all in Japanese of course). Note that there are no cool Japanese cosmetic dothingies like smile molds, eyebrow stensils or eyelid tape - BOO.   The other small spaces are occupied by a grocery/bakery store (with NO Japanese KitKats so why even exist?), a meat shop where you can get Kobe beef, and a fish shop that is also a sushi stop.   Now you may be reading my review and think: hmm...hey that sounds like a lot. Now imagine all of that crammed into a space about the size of a large 7-11. That's J-Town.   So really there not much for me to go back for although I didn't get to try the tea house that is on site or the sushi place which I heard has some of the best sushi in the Greater Toronto Area.",-1,0
"Have been coming here for ages. It's changed quite a bit over the years, but is now a pretty good place that has a variety of shops. If you're in need of authentic Japanese stuff (mainly good), Japan Town is where to go.  Heisei - The prices seem a little higher than necessary. I recently came back from a long term stay in Japan where I went to the grocery store often and noticed the very significant differences in price.   FaMu - Shop here for some great meats. They also have their items packaged, which come in handy on those nights that you don't feel like cooking. FaMu also serves daily lunch specials.  Â¥100 Shop - A lot of good finds here. I often buy their clear plastic folders for work. Their Tupperware comes in handy as well.  I could go on, but these three shops are where I go to the most.   Good for: Japanese goods",-1,0
"This J-Town is so small, it should be called J-Village or J-Burg--maybe even J-Hamlet--but certainly not J-Town.  Where are the usual J-Town fixtures like the Japanese dollar store, roasted chestnut vendor, and teahouse evoking Memoirs of a Geisha?  I guess this Japanese mall is a reflection of the Japanese population in the Toronto area; practically non-existent. But if I were the perfect Japanese housewife, I suppose I'd make the rounds at:  Famu ""Natural Meats, Japanese Cuts"" for Wagyu beef and organic pork Sakana-ya for live uni, toro, and some kind of small red fish that goes for $80/lb Heisei Mart for 20 kinds of miso, Japanese curry cubes, and a gazillion bottles of Japanese condiments  Or I could just be lazy and feed my family prepared foods like the potato croquettes, Hamburg steak, and sushi combos.  Then pick up some eclairs and strawberry shortcakes from Bakery Nakamura. Indulge myself in a haircut at Studio T, and browse the book and video selection at the Japan Book Centre.  And because all that shopping would make me hungry, I'd refuel with an offering from the oden lady out front who sells skewers of fish cakes from a big steaming kettle.   That would be the perfect day in J-Town.",-1,0
"Somewhat difficult to explain, but J-Town is a cluster of small businesses on the ground floor of 2-3 commercial buildings.  The main portion of J-Town would be the grocery store flanked with a couple of food stalls, with seating, on either side.  In between the buildings, there is a small 'courtyard' area.  There's no directory, but then again, it's not really needed 'cause there aren't that many businesses here.  J-Town By The Sea, which is also a food stall, sells sashimi grade fish.  Other than that, I can imagine that most things at the grocery store can be found in other larger Asian grocery stores.",-1,0
"The previous name was Fabulous Bakery and Cafe...  and when you look at the signage it now says Fabulous Bar and Cafe.  And that is what it is. I believe it operates as a bar cafe during the day, and I have only really experienced it at night.  Nice and central being right next to Bay and Dundas, it also gets a very interesting mixed crowd being opposite the Bus Depot.  You can always expect Rex the owner there in his leather vest, the nice but crass workers, and reasonable drinks, and no one will look at you like you dont belong. It's usually as place of don't belongs.  Plus they are super flexible, allowing people to bring their own 'desktop computer speakers' + ipod to have a real throw down party with the music you like.. of course you should probably pre arrange that...  Low key, no dress code, never without a drink, it's all you need. Relaxing and gets the job done.",-1,0
"We went here due to the location, just arrived off of the Megabus and needed nourishment.  Not knowing the city we went in to get some lunch.   The menu was creative, the service a bit slow, but the young man working was pleasant.   The portions were average sized.  The Chicken tenders were pretty good.  The Mediterranean salad was a nice combination of grilled vegetables with a cold salad side.   We found it a little pricey, but overall a good meal.  4 entrees were $60.",-1,0
"Nice view of the planes taking off, and very nice people. I had the cheese and margarita selection and cannoli.  The pizza wasn't bad, but nothing I would crave. The cannoli shell was not super fresh tasting, not rancid or anything and just was a bit dense and lacked the crunch I normally like.  The filling was nice though.  The one extra special thing this place offers is a vegan pizza.",-1,0
Just another Pizza of place in Vegas looks really old even is known that really old part of town plenty of parking in the front two empty business side by side it's kind of cool how you can go to the driveway to the apartment complex on the west side that way you can exit West on Sunset other than that yeah that's it,-1,0
"Had the groupon and had heard good things so I decided to give it a try.  Garlic knots are acceptable. Marinara is unremarkable. Pizza is disappointing.  The method used is blatantly the same as costco's, ball of dough squashed in a press.  Toppings are sparse and really there is just no flavour.  Service was friendly enough but yeah, skip it and go somewhere else.",-1,0
"Not bad. We went there while waiting to renew passport for our daughter. Food was pretty good, though not very fast (guess you can't be with fresh-made-from-scratch). Wings were tasty and the calamari was okay, but it was on greens which quickly got soggy and hence not very edible. (Don't recommend calamari to go...)  Their specialty seems to be delivery, but they do have places to sit (almost as if an after thought...""Hm. Guess we should put up a some tables and chairs to sit on..."")  Guys were nice, but it seems that only one person takes orders and if he's on the phone, then you don't get helped. Kind of weird set up. Needs work on system for taking orders. They seem new at the restaurant business...  Food quality was good, but the ""delivery"" wasn't great (see comment about calamari above). Haven't tried pastas and such, but probably a good place to get food for football watching parties. Not a lot of sitting room for parties there.",-1,0
"Not bad at all. This is our first time here but we will be back. Glad to have a descent, local pizza place nearby. We had their spinach calzone, turkey club and buffalo chicken roll. I am anxious to try other stuff, especially their Vegan pizza. Atmosphere is a little make-shift but You should stop in and try it out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",-1,0
"Decided to go for brunch one Saturday morning and boy, this place is packed. Arrived at around 10am and after queueing for (what seemed like an eternity) an hour, we were finally seated. Ordered normal breakfasts with eggs, bacon, sausages. My family had waffles and omelette too. The food was okay but the experience was marred because of the initial long wait to get seated. It's not really the restaurant's fault that they are so popular. Having said that, I suppose if I were to go back, I'd have to schedule it in the summer when I can wake up earlier and have proper breakfast.",-1,0
"Came here as a party of two at 1pm on a Sunday. First thoughts were this place is busier than expected (no line, but no free tables either) and has a cool contemporary layout.  We ordered Oreo pancakes, Greek omelette, side of French toast, and OJ.  Oreo pancakes: great with maple syrup - fluffy and good amount of Oreo chunks. Satisfied my sweet tooth :) Greek omelette: omelette contained black olives, feta cheese and onions - tasty combination, and the accompanying homefries were well seasoned French toast: maybe it's made differently as a main but these were really underwhelming... pretty bland  OJ: served a bottle of Minute Maid. The menu didn't say freshly squeezed so guess that's fine  Service was slow - seemed to be understaffed. We had to wait at first to be acknowledged, and then again for the bill.  Overall - decent, would be fine with returning here and trying other menu items, but in no rush to do so.",-1,0
"The food good was as usual , but the service was meh today!  Please note: they recenlty hired a lot of new servers, and from my personal expericene, it seems like it has started to vary  I was not greeted with a smile, and my server never did a table check on me( they all do at this place )  but did a table just across from me.. Why? I wonder....also they charge $2.50 bottomless but did not offer once to a refill?   Server's name Vanlentina!!!!",-1,0
"I came here during the weekday and they appear to have specials for $5.99 which includes eggs, fruit, bacon/sausage and toast.  I asked if I didn't get meat and if it would be the same price. They said it would be so value wise, I didn't think it was worth ordering without meat.  I decided instaed on the Eggs Florentine because who can resist poached eggs? Definitely not me.   Well, the dish was okay,the eggs were poached well, but the Hollandaise sauce was quite bland.  It also came with hash browns, which tasted amazing. Loved the seasoning on them.  Verdict: It's your typical breakfast diner joint. It doesn't have a lot of specialized dishes, but it will do the job for a diner-type breakfast.",-1,0
"I've been here twice not, and it's not bad, but the food is quite... average. It's not super cheap but you do get large portions, especially for the ""Big Breakfast"" sets.

Their menu is decent and attractive.  We ordered their 3 egg breakfast which comes with toast and potatoes. I went with make your own omelettes which also comes with toast and potatoes. I got them to put in mozzarella, onions and green peppers. The breakfast was quite nice.  The service is good and the server comes back to see if everything is good. The price point for the quantity and quality is decent as you come out satisfied.   The restaurant is not to big and has plenty of seating but does get busy on weekends. There is plenty of parking.",-1,0
"I wish it didn't take so long for us to get service. Honestly other than that I really dig the environment and food (the food was fantastic). I ordered the bacon waffle and black coffee, both fantastic (and finished it!) but the waitress took another tables order that sat after us before ours. I'll perhaps try it again.",-1,0
"Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing because my experience does not jibe with the other glowing reviews.  I ordered the California chicken clubhouse (no mozzarella) with onion rings. The onion rings were your standard frozen onion rings. Nothing to get excited about. Even the clubhouse wasn't as great as the description sounded. I mean, guacamole, yay! But there was hardly any guac on my sandwich and it was pretty flavourless.   My dining companion ordered the eggs benny and he suspected the Hollandaise was from a mix and he was therefore not impressed.",-1,0

"Early bird special is a steal!  A good all-day breakfast place, which I hope will last for years! (Also super selfish with this wish as it is only minutes from home.)  ATMOSPHERE: Nice and casual. Suitable for family, young kids, or come with friends. Good sized dining room, with a mix of 4-person booths, and tables which can accommodate larger parties.   SERVICE: Very friendly staff, although during busy breakfast hours they seem short-staffed sometimes.    PRICE: Very good portions for appropriate prices.   FOOD: They've got all the basics. And some nice twists. Not a ""WOW"" place - but pretty consistent, and hits the spot when craving breakfast foods. Again, good portions.   Love the breakfast poutine - but often served beginning from lunch time on only.  My family regularly comes here, and will continue to do so!",-1,0
"Go here about once a month, set us is great and efficient. I've never seen the line be unmanageable,  even at their peak times.   Food is along the lines of other greasy spoons but with more lunch and waffle options. But I wish they had more healthy options than turkey bacon or salad.   Love that you can do poached, fried or any style eggs with no issues.   Family friendly with nice children liking servers!   Inside def looks better than other breakfast joints with more than enough tvs set on channel 24!  Portions are good and prices are even better!",-1,0

Had the California Club.  Chicken was bland N needed seasoning. Had to add mustard to the sandwich which helped a little. The potatoes also needed something more to it. Coffee was weak.  My friend had the pancakes which were heavy and under cooked.  They promote their love for bacon and all things pork. But their Ham meh and the Bacon just ok. Nothing special.  The service was great and price was decent.  3* Bc it was it's just middle of the line ... nothing to rave about.,-1,0
i had heard that this was an excellent place for a fabulous meal. great meal? check. excellent venue? ummm ... i think i was initially just weirded out by their large fish aquarium up front. it cast a weird 1980s miami vice blue glow out into what could be transformed into a really upscale room.   the lighting needs work. but the waitstaff is helpful. it's pretty expensive - they've got prices i'd justify if they could get the atmosphere right.,-1,0
"We went to Nadia's for some kind of special occasion about 5 years ago.  I dont remember anything being particularly dirty, like a previous reviewer said.  I do remember the huge fish tank., but not the TVs.  The fish tank wasn't dirty when we were there, though we do agree it did give a Miami Vice kinda vibe, haha.   The service was very good.  The food was bland, other than salt , sugar, and butter.  By this chriteria, I agree it was way overpriced.  Exotic varieties of fish etc, but if you want monkfish, baked in butter, etc it's abailable fresh at seafood center, and very easy to cook at home. The walk up the stairway to enter was kinda weird, but overlookable.  I enoyed the character of the old brick building.",-1,0

Just really old school vegas. Vegas actually needs more places like this. Hate to say it but I will be back lol,-1,0
This place is a real dump but I love it!  You can't have every Vegas experience be 1st class; sometimes you have to get down and dirty with the locals and some low rollers.  The drinks are cheap I think u get 2 pitchers of beer for $10 (beer pong),-1,0
"Yes this place is small, with the stench of stale beer and the sights of old people and crackheads, its a wonder this place has been here for so long. What attracts me to this place is their .99 cent jumbo hot dog. Uhm yea it's pretty huge. Great place to also people watch. The gaming is fairly inexpensive. But it's not like getting points for the Wynn for your player's club card.  I can't give it a bunch of stars. Because based on how I'm rating things. It's the nostalgia which is great - yet downfall. In reality I'd give it 3.5 stars - There's nothing but you can really do here other than gaming - people watching, and eating big hot dogs...",-1,0

Do you know what I am talking about?  The game where you try to get the coins to drop off of the end and into your bucket.  Anyway, it was the most entertaining loss of $12 I have ever enjoyed.

"Upgrades ruined this place. About 10 years ago I got my first taste of slots a fun. I loved it. One night, myself and my best friend were playing these two nickel machines in the back. We played for 12 hours then got our sorry butts on the bus and went back to the hotel at 5am. We loved those machines. It was one of the few places you actually put your nickel in. .50 roulette, you played for the love not to get rich. We ate at the subway in the middle of the night. Although overpriced it was good and surprisingly we didn't get sick!!! Now slots a fun has been killed by modern gambling. It's electronic now, no putting in your nickel and pulling the reel. The table games are closed. I did play some video roulette because we walked a good ways to get there and I wasn't going to make it a wasted trip. They should have just left it be. If I'm in the area I'll stop in. But back in the day we would go out of our way and travel down the strip to get there and play. It was our favorite spot. Now it's just a dumpy version of what modern casinos are. Boo.",-1,0

"The slots are ok.  I used to frequent (from 2003-2009) because of the 50 cent chips on the roulette table.  So I learned roulette at this casino.  They have replaced the physical roulette table with a slot machine that only seats 4.  BAD CHOICE!!!! I would suggest they had at least 4 more seats to this machine because that was about the amount of people the old physical tables could hold.  It makes it hard to get on the machine because of the limited amount of space.  All the table games have gone mechanical and exist as some slot or another.  I think it's sad that its come to that.  But they're trying to remain competitive.  I think the servers/waittresses should be on the floor more, but maybe there are less of them too.  Getting a drink took forever.    Overall, I enjoyed gambling here.  It was nostalgic but I idoubt I'd make the trek down the strip (going out of my  way) again.",-1,0
This place has changed a lot since the last time I was here (about 8 years ago). It is a shell of what it use to be. I remember they use to have dollar foot long hot dogs and yard drinks for cheep but that is gone. Instead they have a subway there. I will say this place is really good for penny slots and has a wide variety of themes and types of machines.,-1,0
"Visited again Feb 2014.  They've actually put some effort in here.  Looked cleaner, drink service was good, hot dogs were good (and cheap), some nice machines.  They have pool tables (which I find odd in a casino...not a big money maker).  An ok mix of gambling machines (smallest casino I've seen, some gas stations have more variety), I saw zero live tables, but to be fair to them, they seem to be making an effort compared to the disaster I saw a couple of years ago.  Not at all crowded mid day Wednesday.  Nice little store with good prices.  Decent dining options, I like the roomy feel with the machines not jammed together.  Amazingly I went from hating this place to considering it as an occasional diversion.  2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3.",-1,0
Cheap gaming and cheap drinks make this an easy place to spend a few hours at the north end of the strip. It feels more like gambling for fun than gambling to win - though the slots here did pay out pretty regularly. The crowds around the tables were also big on enjoying themselves.,-1,0
"Love the name, but the actual place...well, not as much.  I don't know a whole lot about Vegas as I have only visited twice so far in my life. I do know this place dates back to the 70's and was kind of a big deal. They used to have cheap table games, $1 hotdogs, and was always busy. Now, there are no gaming tables, they still have hotdogs but they are no longer $1, and busy...if what I saw on the visit I made was any indication of the norm, then I would say not at all.  Yes, they offer cheap beer and snacks comparatively as well as some cheap souvenirs in their shop, but this place looks dark, dingy, and very tired. I think I read ""seedy"" in another review and that fits as well. I will say the drink service here was good, but I can't say the same for the actual drink. The majority of the slots looked very old, but they were cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. Remember, if you have a players card from neighboring Circus Circus it will work in the machines here as well since CC owns this place.  Slots A Fun does indeed have slots, but whether or not they are A fun is really relative. If I find my way to Circus Circus again I would stop by here for a few minutes, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",-1,0
"Cheap gambling, cheap table games...this is place you go to learn without busting a nut, i mean, busting your wallet while learning how to play... Not only that, but besides driving further down to downtown, this is place has the cheapest coronas and heinekens at $2 a pop, and cheap, and pretty decent food, for when your broke.   They also have a Subway...   Oh, and now they have this lounge act in the back, and oh my god... Think of its a section of the back part of the building, were they have a little stage, and they have this one man band guy singing... guy was pretty cool, and was all into his act... You need to check this out!!!",-1,0
"It's not bad for your standard Italian fare. The food is decent, priced reasonably well, service is ok but don't expect too much.  It's an older restaurant in an old strip plaza.  The place needs a bit of a makeover and IMO, so does the menu.  But hey, chef Ramsay can't be at all places.",-1,0
"This restaurant is just average and not really an authentic Italian eatery. My colleague and I went there for dinner, and were disappointed based upon our experiences vs. what I saw on yelp.

Overall I'd not recommend this restaurant to someone who is looking to get some real Italian food.",-1,0

"We attended Brothers as a party of 6 for a small celebration.   We made a reservation and our table was ready and waiting when we arrived.   The corkage fee was quite reasonable, so we were happy about that, however the restaurant did not have a wine decanter. No big deal there, but a little odd.   We ordered bruschetta and escargot for appetizers and both were very good.   For the mains one person ordered pasta, 4 had steak and one the veal.   The pasta was the most tasty dish out of the three (penne con pollo). Our own mistake for ordering steak at a pasta and pizza joint. One was severely undercooked. When we pointed it out to the server she transferred it to another plate and had it cooked some more. The steak also had a fair bit of grit to it.   We poured our own wine and were not offered coffee or tea after our meal.   Our server was friendly enough but we would likely not return.",-1,0

"1 star by default for being a mostly reliable chain cafe 1 star for great wifi and chill atmosphere 1 star for being open 24 hrs  Minus 2 stars for rude baristas who don't understand the first thing about customer service. Customer service tips for the baristas: Acknowledge your patrons, especially when there is a long line forming instead of having a prolonged conversation with your friend/coworker. Make eye contact with customers (etiquette 101). Don't act like customers are impinging on your time and everything they ask for is a nuisance. You are there to serve not be served on.

"BIG plus for me is they're opened 24-hours 7-days a week!   BIG minus is that on my first visit they refused to give me the code to open the bathroom door. I get the reasons why, but I'm not a street person. I've been a frequent customer of SBUX for many years. I go to a SBUX at least 2-3 times a week and usually order a Trenta Black Iced Tea using the mobile app. I was from out of town and had been there about an hour to get some last minute work over the Internet completed when nature called. I've never before been hassled to use the restroom at Starbucks. I ended up ordering (even though I didn't want it) my usual to get the code. Just seemed a bit tacky to me.  I downgraded this store to a three star rating for their lack of customer service.",-1,0

Free WiFi but more of the concern is finding a seat where you can use your laptop.  Would have given this a 2 star but I kinda have a crush on one of the barista in this joint. She's cute, cool funny personality...oh i better shut up, i'm going off the subject.   So yea, this place is very active and crowded so I recommend another place if you go during the early hours because this place gets crowded.",-1,0

"Okay, let's be clear here. We're talking about a 24 hour breakfast restaurant that happens to sell other items cleverly disguised to be viable options at lunch and dinner.  If you're on your cell phone and you're looking for a plateful of food and just need to get your grub on then you've found your mecca. Any of the breakfast menu items found on one side of the paper placemat menu will do. All you have to decide is how much cholesterol you're in the mood for.  Servers are pretty quick here and when it's busy there's a reason for that - they want to get you in an out as quickly as possible.  The decor has all the charm of the lower deck on the Titanic. I always laugh at the barrier between booths that are side by side. This piece of wood that is elbow height can be removed to make the booths feel more like one unit. Someone put time and effort into this but it really doesn't improve any scenario when removed.  TO SUM IT UP: Come here and get breakfast any time of the day but don't be dissuaded of the book by its cover.",-1,0
The super breakfast is always good. But last time I wanted something different and tried the quiche. Big mistake. Small portion and overcooked to the point that the crust was rock hard. Would go back but only for the breakfast specials.,-1,0
"Came here on a Sunday morning - wasn't that busy. Was a little skeptical about the place when I first approached it and saw the exterior - but it was evident that they did upgrades on the interior.   Fiance and I ordered the Super Breakfast (3 eggs, 3 pancakes, 3 strips of bacon, 3 sausages, home fries) and the Breakfast Special (3 eggs, 3 sausages, home fries and toast).   We usually go to Sunset Grill for breakfast on weekends - but we changed it up and came here. It wasn't that bad.. food came out really fast, the eggs were cooked perfectly. However, the pancakes were a little too dense, I like my pancakes fluffy. As for the sausages, it was a little too salty and too overcooked. Bacon was cooked well - not too crispy.  Would most likely come back again in the future.",-1,0
I love breakfast and I do value good breakfast for a reasonable price. I like how big this place is and lots of room to sit down. But I didn't like the long wait time and also how late the staff were to serve me. The food quality was better than average but I have still had better ones. Overall an ok place to eat. Worth trying it,-1,0
"They are open 24 hours in Scarborough. What more do you want? lol You can't come here with super high expectations.   Their all day breakfast is great however it is pretty greasy compared to other breakfast joints. They also serve different foods like souvlaki dinners, salads, sandwiches, ribs, roasted chicken and etc.  I've only ever had their breakfast foods and chicken souvlaki dinner. Their portions are pretty big, you will not leave feeling hungry if you actually eat your food.   Service here is pretty quick and they always have CP24 on. So catch up on your daily news and weather while munching away at some food that quick!",-1,0
"If you get here before 11am, breakfast here is super cheap and delicious (you really cannot go wrong with breakfast food anyway). Generally, I drop by here when Cora's is too crowded, because there's so much more seating here. However, the reason I only gave this restaurant a 3 out of 5 is because, in my experience, service here is really hit or miss. One day I'll get an amazing server that's kind and friendly, and the next day I'll be waiting for 10 minutes to be seated (when the restaurant is practically empty). Otherwise, they have a solid all day breakfast menu and after renovations, a nice and bright interior. Will probably come again for an early breakfast.",-1,0

"So, if you're from Scarborough, you know about Markham Station. The location has done a number of upgrades with their decor and their food.   The decor makes the place look much more modern. It was apparently done in August 2016 (this year) so it looks all clean and nice. The staff is usually as friendly unless you get them during the club rush at 3am.  The food looks like it was upgraded in certain areas as well. My friend got the Steak and Eggs, and it looked good. The Fish and Chips I had looked like a step up as well. HOWEVER, it tasted similar to how it has been for years. Its decent, and can hit the spot when you're hungry (its 24 hours). But not a place to go out of your way for.   I give it an A-OK since I have been going here for many many years. It is infamous in Scarboruogh for the years of fights that used to occur there. We can all tell stories about this place. Cops would always be there eating/coffee as a deterrent. Upgrades may be good, but it is to soon to determine it it should rank higher. But it is a staple of the east end, especially if you grew up on these streets.",-1,0
Me and my bf came here on a Sunday evening. Ordered souvlaki and baby back ribs. My souvlaki was tasty with a lot of rice and salad on the side. However bf said his ribs were kinda dry.  Service was good. Our server was friendly. I did notice it took a long time for her to take the order for the couple sitting next to us. She was apologetic though.    Decent diner food. I may come back when I am around but probably won't go out of my way to eat here.,-1,0
Food is okay but man it felt like I took off 5 years off my life after eating the onion rings. The batter was thick and soaked in oil. I rather they have less batter and be sliced then so they are more crispy. These were like super huge onion rings. The burger is on par with Harvey's but I think Harvey's burgers are a bit more juicy and thick. I got the banquet burger and it came with cheese and bacon. For about $5 its not bad but found the bacon to be a bit tough and hard like its been sitting for a while. The decor is really old school. It looks like the original signs for the menu were the original ones used from when they first opened and it looks like something from the 80's. Will I be back? Probably not since Harvey's is right across the street but may consider to try their breakfast if I'm really desperate.,-1,0
"It's been a few years since I've eaten here, but first time since they've renovated. There's lots of choice here so there shouldn't be any problem finding something to eat.  Came here at 12:30pm on a Saturday and was able to get a seat right away. Ordered the eggs (sunny side up) with sausages and home fries. Toast is deliciously buttered, but today the home fries weren't as crispy as I'd like them to be.   If you want all day breakfast, you can't go wrong with this place. To get the best value, make sure you get there before 11am.   The service is lacking though as we had empty glasses for quite a while. When I asked for more water, they only gave us one glass. And left the other glasses empty.   4/5 for food and value 2/5 for service",-1,0

Today we went again to get rates and as I told the guy that we have been given different rates he said that this is not true and their rates have not changed for months, but then as we said we would like more time to think about it, he said, as you know our rates change weekly....

"Typical fitness facility. Missing some stuff, but has a lot of repeats of the main equipment.   Decent Customer service. For the most part, everyone behind the counter is pretty inviting.   I took off one star because it just isn't ""perfect"". It's still missing some types of equipment it could easily have.   The second star I took off because this is such a busy gym. It is insane.  From probably 4 pm all the way to 11 pm sometimes it can be packed in here.  I've come in real late sometimes and still have to wait around to get to equipment.   Plus during the busiest hours you have some groups of people doing circuit training taking up 4 or 5 pieces of equipment. To each their own on training, I'm not putting down circuit training, but doing it at the busiest time of day is .... not nice... I'll just say it's not nice so my review doesn't get taken down.   It's just a very frustrating experience. There's nothing the gym can do about the people. Maybe ask the groups not to circuit train when the parking lot is so full you can hardly find a parking space, but aside from that... There isn't a whole lot the gym can do about the people there.   The good customer service shows they are trying. This just isn't a good gym to go to if you are serious about training because you NEVER know when you are gonna walk in and have to change up your whole plan because every piece of equipment you need is gone.  That said. The golds off of Lake Mead and the one in Henderson are great locations. Never seem to have any real trouble getting around in those.",-1,0

"More like 2.5 stars.  Not the best Applebees I've been to but not the worst either.  They seem to have some strange policies in place.  If you order car side to go after 8:00 they make you go into the restaurant.  They also won't seat until your entire party is there even if your entire party is two people and the restaurant is fairly empty.    The servers were fairly unprofessional.  At one point our server shouted over our table to the bar tender about something.  I suppose that sort of thing happens when the oldest employee that evening appered to be under 30 years old.  Not that people who are young can't be professional, but this crew certainly was not.  Service was also fairly slow.  Often I had to ask more then once for either more water or a side of sauce.    Food is typical of any Applebees.  As long as you go expecting chain restaurant food, you won't be disappointed.  The best deals are to go after 9 and get half off of a nice selection of appetizers.",-1,0
I stopped by here just to get a Caesar salad and meet my sister for some drinks. It wasn't busy tonight so I was happy that I wouldn't have to wait or squeeze through the large crowds.   By the time I got to the restaurant my sister had already ordered her meal. She got the shrimp and rice dish which I thought was very bland. The rice was cooked pretty well and the shrimp too but it just tasted like tomatoes nothing special.   I ordered a Cesar side salad and my hubby got the Blondie dessert dish. Both were pretty good I finished all my salad and I had a small bite of his Blondie which taste like a vanilla brownie. It wasn't 9 o'clock yet so I didn't get a chance to take advantage of the discount appetizers and drinks specials but I still managed to order me a long island. It wasn't that strong which is what I prefer but it tasted a lot like lemonade as opposed to ice tea.  I do like how they updated the place and I don't really have any bad things to say about it but it is just a typical run-of-the-mill chain restaurant. most of the food sometimes does taste like it came from a microwave package. I guess it's what you can expect from a chain place although there are some better Applebee's but this one just happened to be the closest to my house.,-1,0

"Joined The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery for their 4th Anniversary party and to try out their brews and enjoyed it thoroughly, mostly because my husband got their bourbon brew and underestimated the alcohol content.  Hilarious.  Enjoyed a nice soft pretzel and their potato salad and grilled cheese.  The food wasn't amazing, but wasn't bad and went great with their cold beers.  I went for their amber ale, and for someone like me who isn't a beer expert by any means, it was good.  Nice big open space, live music, good affordable food and a nice young crowd makes for a good night and good times.  Hopefully, they'll do some more marketing and have more live music and I can definitely see myself coming back again.",-1,0
Really dug this place. I liked the feel of it -just a huge hall with tables in it -and the tour was very informative. It was nice to see where all they distribute their beer and have it on tap---seeing local businesses succeed always makes me happy. This would be a great place to take an out of towner who appreciates beer or to catch a game.   I tried the Mecklenberger and Cooper and both were tasty with full flavor. They had a cart dude outside selling brats and dogs but think they could really capitalize on a menu inside (at least apps instead of just pretzels). Last time I checked drinking copious amounts of beer leads to food consumption. And who doesn't love bar food?,-1,0
"My husband is into craft beer so we went there with some friends while we were in town. They tried 8 beers, a friend said they didn't vary too much in taste in her opinion, but they were good.

"We decided to do a tour of the breweries in Charlotte and OMB was our first stop. First off, let me say that the atmosphere is absolutely incredible! I For those that have expressed a distaste for it, they need to recognize that OMB modeled their tasting room after a German beer hall. I  love the large spacious inside and the picnic tables outside are a real treat for the beautiful North Carolina days. It's also great that they have a food selection,  as opposed to many other breweries. However, I imagine that this might make them less likely to have food trucks as I've seen so often at other breweries.   My major complaint with OMB was their beer selection and quality. I admire breweries with the balls to brew under the Reinheitsgebot, which is the German purity law allowing only water, barley, and hops. Provisional laws later allowed added yeast (at the time its role wasn't recognized in the brewing process despite its presence), wheat malt, and cane sugar. However, I truly feel that brewing under these requirements can stifle creativity and the flavor creations that can come from the use of other adjuncts. Despite trying their flight and sipping on a few, I was disappointed in their beer selection.",-1,0

"If you are reading this review because you are planning to eat sushi alone, look elsewhere. I am not reviewing the sushi!  I will give the restaurant 3.5 stars and my food 2.5 stars. I was optimistic for my ramen dish, hoping to be reminded of the ramen, from many of the ramen shops in Japan. I was bummed with the serving size (for $11 with tax), but that is OK, I was most disappointed with was the taste. Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe something I did not agree with, it was oily and a bit too salty. The desert was a savior. Even though I can buy mochi balls for half the price and in more quantity elsewhere, I was glad they served it at their location. Convenience anyone? In addition, I like the black tea they serve, in a can. But the price was a little steep. If I'd go again, I'd just get water (I'll buy the tea on my own thanks). This place is tolerable if you want ramen. However, I cannot say anything of the sushi. I am not a big fan of sushi since I can only eat the non-shellfish variety. The atmosphere is lovely, the waiters are polite, and the service is bearable.",-1,0

Not the best I have ever had, but solid.  And who knows, maybe I didn't order well?  One can never tell.  I also must disclose that I went with my ex-boyfriend.  I'm sure this influenced my perception in some way.  He has issues with ""personal space"", so being at the end of a crowded sushi bar with a server  reaching over us, which I must admit was in poor form (the serve could have easily taken two more steps to the edge of the bar instead of reaching over our heads) was not ideal.  Plus, I was out to dinner with my ex-boyfriend. Need I say more?  This is never advisable.  I may need to go back another night to sample the fare under more favorable conditions.  We shall see.",-1,0

"I've had both great and sub-par experiences here so I gave it the middle of the road rating.  The first time I was here, I was blown away by how different the sushi was and how they had things no other sushi bars seemed to have in Arizona.  The next 3 times I went back, Sunday, Sunday, and Friday back to back, I've been noticing things that I did not notice the first time.  First, I would like to say that I believe that a waiter/waitress should not wear cologne/perfume.  I did not notice it the first time I went, but every other time, I noticed the guy bringing the sushi literally bathes in the stuff.  I'm about to eat a bite out of my 10$ per serving of Monkfish liver and catching a big wiff of [insert popular brand of men's cologne here] is not appetizing.  Especially since smell is so heavily associated with taste.  A very big faux pas in my book.  After the great experience the first time, a few months later, I went 3 times in a row... back to back Sundays and Friday, I was able to notice that their specials didn't change in that time frame.  The chef's-here's-a-little-something-extra-you-didn't-order was the exact same also.  Maybe it's just me but I know a lot of places change their specials at least once a week.  How is the special still fresh if I see it every time I go?  I know the special is still there because they have not sold it out yet.  You know?  Also, their tempura is really sub-par in my book.  I know it's pretty hard to not have good shrimp tempura, but it's really blah. I've been able to taste it every single time I went there (it comes out as a side to a lot of noodle dishes such as udon and soba) but it tastes really floury and oily, and it's pretty heavy, batter-wise.  Shrimp tempura should be very light, almost an airy crisp, but not here.  My fellow diners were all in surprised agreement their tempura really was pretty blah.  Also, if you really like the tempura sauce other places have; the warm savory dipping broth other places have with grated daikon radish, don't expect it here.  You gotta use your soy sauce.  :(  Their cold soba noodles are very salty.  I've had to ask for a glass of ice and literally had to use the entire cup to dilute it enough to tolerate the saltiness.    The praises of this place come from the type of sushi you cannot find elsewhere.  I love the saba here, which is Mackerel.  Other places usually take the easy route and marinate it in the pickled ginger juice or their own vinegar marinade, but this place really serves the raw stuff.  Very good.  A must try in my book.    Sometimes Hana has monkfish liver, which is hard to find elsewhere.  It's better than uni (Sea urchin gonads) and literally the foie gras of the sea.  Very similar in texture and taste.  Mmmm... So good!!!  Better than the average sushi bar, but a couple of things really rubbed me the wrong way and therefore brought my rating down to 3 stars.",-1,0
"Nice looking little place. We were promptly seated, but the service was a bit slow as the evening progressed. The diners who had brought their own beer/wine seemed to receive better service. All three of us ordered ice green tea and were surprised to receive cans instead of brewed. I honestly thought the waitress was surprised at us ordering it.  We ordered a variety of items, including the salmon-covered california roll and the unagi nigiri. The sushi we had was very fresh, and I think the unagi was the most flavorful I've had. The rolls in general were a bit losely made, and the shrimp tempura roll was simply out of proportion: there was no way to eat a single piece without taking multiple bites, so it kind of ruined the concept of a ""roll"".  While nothing was bad per se, there wasn't really anything special that inspired me to want to return, and the prices were really high. I'd have rated it 4/5 if the prices had been more in line with other sushi restaurants.  We didn't bother with deserts with Mary Coyle's Ice Cream Parlor being directly across the street.",-1,0

Sorry only 3 stars... I mean the sushi is not bad at all. Fancy creative rolls but for what I paid I don't think the food should cost that much ($60 for 2).. the tuna tar tar is tasteless and not fresh to me.. the rolls are so so.. good serive,-1,0
"Yesterday I was seeking out a sushi bar in our quest to locate the best sushi in Phoenix, and this place looked promising.  They had chefs who will make something interesting for you, and that is what I really like in a good sushi restaurant.  When we walked in and looked at the menu, it looked decent.  They had ankimo, so of course we got that.  We also ordered some scallops, red snapper, spanish mackerel with deep-fried body, a baked salmon roll, some uni shooters, the carpaccio, and we also told them to just make us something interesting.  We started out with miso soup.  It was pretty typical.  The carpaccio set the tone for the rest of the meal - on paper, stips of red snapper, tuna, yellowtail, and salmon with a cucumber garnish and fresh wasabi should be awesome.  But it was missing something.  It was kind of bland.  The carpaccio we had last week was one of the highlights; this time it was boring.  If you have read any of my other recent sushi reviews, you'd know that one of my new favorite dishes is ankimo (or steamed monkfish liver).  The ankimo they served us happens to be the first ankimo I didn't like.  For some reason it tasted bland, and it was even a different color and texture than other ankimo I had.  I suspect this was overcooked.  They also brought us the ankimo sliders for good measure (hopefully they didn't charge us for this, because we didn't ask for it), and they were decent, but not mind-blowing.  The waitress told us people usually bite the lemon it is served on in order to balance it out; my friend tried that and said it totally ruined it.  Makes sense, as the slider has a lot of delicate flavors, and lemon is not delicate at all.  The sushi (red snapper, scallop, Spanish mackerel) was pretty typical.  I did like the deep fried Spanish mackerel body.  The fish itself had very little meat, though.  I've had Spanish mackerel with twice as much meat (see: Yama Sushi in Portland).  The baked salmon roll was a terrible idea.  I knew the idea of a cooked roll would not really appeal to me... But I was open to it.  I like to let other people order things they want, too, you know... But neither of us cared for it.  We think it actually had cheese on it.  Yes, cheese, on a seafood dish.  I would totally back legislation that made combining fish and yellow cheeses illegal.  The uni shooters epitomized this place.  It was an idea that sounded really, really awesome on paper, but was poorly executed.  You see, the uni shooter contains an oyster, a piece of uni, and a raw quail egg.  Sounds awesome, right?  Of course it does.  But it also had a sauce that was so strong that it completely masked the flavor of the things I actually wanted to taste.  The oyster could still be noticed, but the quail egg was barely detectable, and the uni might as well have been left out.  Uni is delicate, and should not be served with strong flavors.  Without the sauce, it would've been perfect.  I actually enjoyed the special item the chef made us.  It was described to us (by who I believe may have been the owner) as a Japanese comfort food.  Basically, it was a small stew/soup thing with eggs, uni, and a couple other things in it.  It really was unique, and I haven't had anything else quite like it.  Finally, the dessert menu contained one item I got really excited about: tempura ice cream.  It has been about nine years since I had the dish in Kingston, NY, so, of course, I had to order it.  Unfortunately, instead of one big scoop of ice cream, it was served in three small scoops, so all but a little ball of ice cream from each scoop was melted.  It was basically tempura soaked in cream.  Again, great idea, poor execution.  This is a place I want to like, because the owner does have some creativity, and probably cares about the cuisine.  It's definitely not generic, and that's definitely worth something.  But compared to the meal we had last week, it paled in comparison.  It was inferior in every single respect, and our bill was actually larger!  In Phoenix, you can't charge $90/person after tip and expect repeat business, unless the entire experience is spectacular.  Because there are places that provide that at that price point.",-1,0
Good food good times. I've tried almost every sushi roll. The rainbow roll is one of my favorites. This visit I had the Alaskan and the Caterpiller and the oldy but goody California roll. Always with a cup of hot green tea.  This place will allow you to bring your own alcoholic drinks but you can not sit in their patio area if you do.,-1,0
"My co-workers and I came to eat here last Friday. One of them really wanted sushi and I've been wanting to try this place, so we thought we give it a try. We all got sushi, I got a little bit ahead of myself and got a Hana Bento Lunchbox. The sushi was great, we were the first ones there when it opened so we got our food fairly quickly. The place did get busy as lunch time rolled around. I didn't give this place 5 stars because when it was time to pay our checks they told us that we were each going to be charged an extra $1.50 for a split charge fee. That kind of pissed me off because how hard is it to really split a check? And why wouldn't you do it for free knowing that you're located by office buildings? I just don't understand the fee and because of this none of us are willing to go back now.",-1,0
"Did i go to the wrong place? all the great reviews & then....meh!!!! The quality was decent, definitely not the best ive ever had...good, but for the price there are better spots in the valley. i appreciate that its a small female owned business & we may stop back by - but i definitely wasnt feeling the love like so many others.",-1,0
"It was an ok / meh kind of place.  If you work nearby it might be worth a try, but don't bother making a long drive.  I came in for the lunch special to see what all the hype was about.  Overall the sushi seemed dry.  There are many sushi places in the valley, and many that offer better sushi at a cheaper price.",-1,0
"3 out of 5 based on Sushi alone. Sushi wasn't prepared very well, it fell apart easily and the taste was just ok.   Willing to go back to try again as the staff was nice and there seemed to be a lot of regulars.   BYOB.",-1,0
Food was on pricey side for their dinners especially for a place that small and no liquor license.   I eat at many Asian restaurants and never pay that much anywhere.  Too noisy.  I was there yesterday with a group and we could not hold a conversation due to the noise.  Even trying to hear the person next to you at times was difficult.  Not well organized. Waiter just plunked all our checks in middle of table and we had to figure out who they belonged to.  Checks were handwritten and confusing.  Made a $2 error in their favor on my check which I called to their attention.  I also did notice that when they include the gratuity they are basing it on the total which includes the tax.  This is not right. It is not the amount it is the principle.e noise.    I opted for an appetizer of sliced pork in order to avoid the fried as well as the high carb foods.  This was just average in taste.  They do not take reservations but this could be due to the size and number of tables.  Would not recommend for groups over 4.,-1,0
"Took my dad here when he was in town.  He is a traditional Japanese eater so no bistros or fancy sushi for him!  We don't live close to this neighborhood at all but we were in the hood and asked around about a Japanese restaurant close by.  Hana was recommended to us as a good but a little on the pricey side place to eat.  They were correct.   It was almost hard to find a spot to park.  The restaurant is very tiny and it was very packed.  They told us 20 minutes for a table, but we only waited about 5.  The hostess was very nice and polite.  The service was quick and to my dad's excitement, our server was Asian.  (he has this weird thing about not eating at an Asian restaurant unless some of the servers/chefs are Asian - says it's a sign of ""Americanization of the food"").  The ambiance was welcoming but yet had that urban feel to it.  All the employees seemed extremely nice and polite and there were some large parties waiting for tables for over 40 minutes.  There's something to be said about the restaurant if these people were willing to wait that long with children.    We ordered the usual stuff, edamame, soup, salad, sushi, etc.  The edamame came out cold - never had cold before.  When my dad asked them if we could get hot ones they nuked the ones we had, making them a little soggy.  All the food was good, not exceptional.  The reason for 3 stars is it's quite pricey for the quality and for what we had.  We have a Japanese restaurant in our hood that serves the same quality food for less.  Of course, there are no Asian people working there so Dad's out...  Overall, if I was in the area again, I might stop by to try some other items on the menu but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop again.  If you are in the area, it's definitely worth a try.",-1,0
"So about 5 months ago I had a normal life, you know a dope little condo, a nice girlfriend, even a little pup, but what my life was really lacking, was a dopalicious sushi joint in my life and as if my eyelash wishes came true Hana appears, I can easily say its the second best sushi joint in Phoenix (right behind Yasu) and honestly if Hana could figure out a way to make there sushi rice a little more enjoyable I would easily pass the crown. There fish must be caught in Garanda Parks lakes thats how fresh it seems (I know horrible reference but they have great fish) and the statement BYOB is bob spelled with a y and who doesn't like bob (which will save you cash money son, plus there is something liberating about drinking 40's in public).   So if you want to have ultra fresh sushi without all the garbage glam that most sushi places throw in your face, while drinking some steel reserve with a date who you are trying to convince that you once lived a normal life, than this place is perfect for you yo.",-1,0
"I have always heard of a bento box, but never seen one before until today for lunch. It was quite tasty. It was kinda fun having one we thought.  Looking over the menu, they are quite expensive for what I am used to with Sushi. I know its Phoenix, and Sushi is probably pretty hard to come by, but to me this sushi was just average. We had a spicy tuna roll while waiting for our bento boxes and we both agreed it was just ok. A rainbow roll here goes for about 15$ which we both thought this was on the high side compared to some other places we visit.  The service was excellent and their staff was very friendly. Its a good place that is semi close to downtown if you need to get your sushi kick for lunch.",-1,0
"We had sushi, and it was very good, but logistics are a problem.  They don't take reservations, so we waited 1/2 an hour for a table (no place to sit, so we stood with about 15 other people).  Then, once we were seated, it took almost 15 minutes more for someone to even take our order, so we didn't eat for more than an hour after we got there.    As I said, the food is very good (not the greatest I've ever had, but still good) ... but I'm not sure it's worth an hourlong wait to eat it.  Next time, we'll go at an off time, or wait for them to expand their space.",-1,0
"I really wanted to give this place a 3.5 but unfortunately that's not possible and I felt the experience leaned more toward 3 stars.    So first off we got there on a busy Saturday and it was packed and extremely loud, to the point where you have to yell at the people across your table and can barely hear your server. Then we learned that it was BYOB, but luckily there's a corner market nearby that you can acquire alcohol at.   We were told a 15 min wait and that it was a ""high guess"" but it still took about 15 minutes which wasn't that bad. Finally after getting our table and beer we looked over the menu which had a good amount of items on it and were all very tasty, albeit a bit pricey (20$ for 6 pieces of mackerel are you serious?!). Our appetizers came and they were very good although they were all fried and that's pretty hard to mess up, but I give them the benefit of the doubt and would recommend them.  By this point it really starts sinking in that it's very hard to talk and have conversation. I don't mind a rowdy atmosphere at a bar where it's expected and part of the experience, but at a delicate sushi restaurant that doesn't even serve alcohol, I was kind of shocked at the volume. You'll think I'm joking until you're in there and realize that there's no padding or insulation whatsoever and that sound is just reverberating off the walls. It was something we dealt with for the time being but when I remember this place I'm going to remember how loud it was and how happy we were to sit in a silent car for 30 min afterwards, it's pretty crazy.   Our sushi arrived with a cute little flaming sugar cube on top of a cucumber slice which was very cool and unique, although we ordered a lot of sushi and they put it on every time so by the third plate, the novelty wears a bit thin. All that aside, I really think the saving grace of this place is the food. If my mouth doesn't mistake me they have fresh wasabi instead of the pre-packaged stuff and the food tasted very fresh. My udon tempura dish took a while to come out of the kitchen but when it did it was very flavorful, rich, and delicious. If I could review different parts of the experience I would say the sushi  and food is a 4/5 rather than a 3/5, but I'm reviewing the restaurant and not just the food.   The service was pretty great I must say, but it's kind of dampened when I have to yell my order at you and when you ask me things I almost have to resort to lip reading (yes it's like being at a concert almost). I'm nitpicking a little bit because it wasn't the services fault and I would actually give them a 4.5/5 because they were that good.   So you may be wondering why after claiming the food is great and the service even better I'm giving it 3 stars. Bear with me when I tell you that I will never go here on a weekend ever again. There are many sushi restaurants in the valley that are just as proficient and delicious without such a horrific ambience. If you're going alone to enjoy a quick meal you will -have- to sit at the sushi bar due to a rule posted on a sign in the front, and when you're sitting at a bar, with no alcohol, and everyone screaming around you, it really kind of ruins the experience.  If you're looking for a place to go during the week I might check it out again because the food and service is good, but all the other small details seem to have been missed when it comes to having a truly fulfilling and extraordinary sushi experience. If you're nearby, give it a go, but steel your nerves because it might test your patience to the limit.",-1,0
"The owner was nice and accomodating.  The prices were a little too high, but within range of most sushi restaurants.  When the food arrived, we were a little dissapointed.  This place and been highly recommended and we drove across town to get there expecting the best sushi in town.  The sashimi was good, but not as fresh as typically offered by our neighborhood sushi restaurant.  In addition, it was not cut by the chef correctly,  leaving it thin with an odd texture.  The rolls were much better, but were on the small side.  However,  the restaurant was charming, the service was great, and the food was otherwise good.  I can see why this place is always busy with regulars.   It's just not worth the drive across town when we have other more convenient options that we prefer.",-1,0
"I had to reflect on our dining experience at Hana before writing a review.  We had great company while dining here and that certainly colors the experience as a whole.  First thing, Hana is BYOB so either don't leave your beer sitting on the counter when you head out like I did or go with cool folks like Kevin H and Marian H who bring a six pack and are happy to share!  After reflection I decided that Hana merits about 2.75 stars.  They are better than average but in some important ways they fall short.  We did not have any sushi so consider this review for the dinners only.  We started with miso soup.  It was very *(salads arrive)* good.  Marian and my wife Audrey were cold every time the ventilation kicked on so the soup was a *(server tries to take Audrey's soup before she is done, is politely rebuffed)* nice warm-up.  We were about to start on our salads and *(Audrey and Kevin's shrimp which comes with the steak arrives)* the chef or manager (I'm not sure which) came over and offered to provide several dressing choices so that we could try different ones.  I went with the *(Kevin's steak arrives)* ginger dressing, although the miso dressing was nice as well.    The shrimp which comes with the steak was served nicely arranged on *(server asks if I am done with my salad)* a small plate with lemons, they tasted very *(Audrey's steak arrives)* fresh and delicious.    Marian and I each ordered a tempura dinner.  They arrived and were nice and hot.  The veggie assortment was *(rice bowls arrive)* very good and the shrimp was tender and flavorful.  I found the pieces of fish to be overdone and one bordered on chewy.  The tempura treatment here was good but heavier than most.  Throughout the meal two things were occurring that detracted from the overall experience.  The blower would kick on and the cool air was focused against the wall and right on Audrey and Marian.  Kevin and I were cool on one side, warm on the other.  We jokingly discussed changing seats from time to time when we were done on one side and needed to warm up the other.  I suggest an 8 foot ladder and some tweaking of the vents would correct this issue.  The food had no pace and toward the end of the meal it become clear that they wanted to turn our table.  Lingering over dessert was not a welcome option.  Water refills stopped toward the end of the meal.  In summary:  the food was pretty good, the pace of the food and service was rushed and random, company was excellent and the atmosphere was warm//\\cold//\\warm//\\cold//\\warm//\\cold.",-1,0
Came here on a recommendation since I was craving good ramen. This place doesn't have the variety that I assumed but the one ramen dish was still pretty decent for Phoenix. Had the takoyaki (fried octopus ball) and that was actually pretty well done. The sushi was pretty good too but nothing amazing.   I'm intrigued that they have okonomiyaki which is not commonly found so I will definitely be back to try other things,-1,0
"Thanks Hana for providing sushi to the central Phoenix crowd.   Dinner last night was consistent with previous experiences. Fried oyster appetizer crunchy and succulent. Accompanying green adequately dressed. Tempura was crisp, not greasy, and a perfect match for the soy broth and soba noodles. Very tasty!  But Hana, this is how I meant for the food to arrive. I did not want my entree of noodles, followed by my appetizer of oysters and then the greens presented as an after thought. Unfortunately, the three other diners that I was with had the same experience. Food arrived randomly. Rush! Rush! It was like Russian roulette. Then as we were settling into our meal, our server arrived with the check. Whoa Hana!  I know you have a small location and Friday is busy, but let me enjoy the good food that you serve instead of trying to turn a table.",-1,0
"I really wanted to love this place, and in my opinion it fell short. Maybe a three star rating is too harsh, because at the end of the day it is one of the better sushi spots I have been to in Phoenix. However, it is still worlds away from my favorite (see my other reviews). Anyways, a couple of things happened at our lunch that dropped my review from 4 to 3 stars. First, despite not serving alcohol, my party of two wracked up a $100 lunch tab...so it isn't cheap. Second, while we were eating they were cleaning the restaurant with a very offensive industrial type cleaner. The smell completely overwhelmed the delicate flavor of some of the fish. Finally, we ordered a toro tataki.,,which was prepared with a kitchen torch. Something must have went wrong because the fish took on an overwhelming flavor of propane gas.",-1,0

"Lobster bisque was outstanding!  It was a little dark inside,  but nice atmosphere.  Our waitress was very nice.  The mussels were cooled to perfection. The craft beer left a lot to be desired!

"We had a party of 6 with a reservation. I was a few minutes early and the first to arrive and was seated at out table in the back room. It was at leat 5 minutes before i was approached and the waiter wanted to know how many people and when I thought they would arrive, which was a strange question. He then started to walk away with out asking if I wanted anything while I was waiting. I stopped him and asked if he could turn up the heat as I was freezing and had to put my coat back on. There was no one else seated at the time in that room. He instead asked if I wanted coffee or tea to help me warm up which I thought was nice until I got my bill and realized he charged me $2.50 for one cup of tea which he never refreshed with warm water for the rest of the evening. He also did not turn up the heat which did not surprise me as he shrugged his shoulders when I asked as if he thought I was nuts. The rest of the evening the service didn't get any better. He was nice enough, but did not come back and check on us. He forgot several things we ordered and we had to hunt him down and then he carged us the regular price for the taco special and we had to hunt him down again to fix our bills.  The food was ok. The lobster bisque was good, but not over the top good. It could have used more sheery and seasoning. The taco's were all pretty good, the homemade tater tots very good. The flat bread pizza's were dry and felt like they were thrown together in a hurry. The pretzels were good and piping hot, but we had to hunt our server down again to get plates to share. When I got home and looked at my left overs of the flatbread pizza, it looked as if he had picked up the plate and dumped it in the box, some slices were upside down, some were sideways and all of the toppings were off the pizza and all over.  I will give this place one more try to see if this was a fluke. We felt the food was overpriced for what we recieved and the service, even though he was nice, was terrible. I hope they fix the problems or they won't last long.",-1,0
"I'm sad to write this because I really did love this place, but since my last review (8 months ago) I have been there another 4 or 5 times and every time it's a little worse. The food is nothing to write home about, as well as the service. I just found out that they have had 3 chefs since it's opened and you can tell. Something is always different... and not in a good way.  For the price they charge I would expect more than mediocre... which is the best word to describe my last few visits. I still think it's a cool place and the red Sangria is awesome, but I think I will stick to drinks and maybe an app if/when I do come again.",-1,0
"Could have been great, but bad service to first time customer is a deal breaker.  Came early evening with very limited customers competing for blonde bartender's attention.  Unfortunately, she was more concerned about talking with friends at another table about her recent hair color change. We received sporadic service and I actually was semi-understanding until after waiting patiently to get her attention she refused to give me the happy special on wine because it was 6:02.  I really was shocked given that I would have had plenty of time to get the order in if she actually was paying proper attention to us.  The food was okay and the wine was not bad, but her total disregard for treating customer's well turned me off and I won't be back.",-1,0
"First, I love places that do small plates. It's so hard to finish portions at a restaurant now.  The beer and wine selection here fits with the name. Don't worry, they have fun drinks here as well! I had the sangria which was pretty good but had a little too much orange juice in it. Still delightful though.  I had the lunch combo with the lobster bisque and the grilled cheese. The bisque was quite good. Very creamy with a hearty helping of seafoody goodness. The grilled cheese on the other hand was pretty boring. Just some bread and kraft singles like I would have made at home for my niece and nephew. I was hoping for a little more pizazz...maybe bacon or fancy cheese? Dipping the sandwich into the soup saved the day though.   Overall I loved the vibe and most of my order. I would definitely try this place out again!",-1,0

"I went here for lunch with a group today after having dinner last week. I have also been to their Hudson location for dinner a few months ago, so I was familiar with the menu and food concept. They have taken a former restaurant space that had been dormant for at least three years and did a very good remodeling job, taking out some of the booths, installing some nice rough wood wall treatments and very pleasing and attractive lighting. The food concept is ""small plates"", and I'll admit that I've never been a fan, as the portion sizes shrink quite a bit and the prices don't. They suffer from the same problem, although the lunch selections are not overly small and they do offer a nice ""combo"" value for soup and salad or sandwich.  The ""Lager"" refers to the good selection of beers that they have on tap, and they are one of the few places that I have found the very tasty ""Crispin"" hard cider. They also have quite a few wines on tap and their selection is good although a bit on the higher priced side.  Now the good: excellent lobster bisque, caesar salad, and stuffed pepper appetizer (only available at dinner). Very good ""small plates"" at dinner: crab cake, Maine clams, and sliced filet.  Not so good: service was slow and they seemed a bit overwhelmed. Understandable if this was really a ""new' operation, but their Hudson menu and management experience could have (should have) made them better prepared. Orders were slow to be taken and water refills were pretty much nonexistent. I had the burger, cooked ""medium"" and it came out well done and also without any of the condiments I had requested.  All in all, I will be back, as Medina needs more options downtown, and there is a lot of promise here. Nice article in the Gazette today, and the owner was quoted as saying he would love to have people have a drink at Thyme2, have dinner at L&V and then have an after dinner beer at Sully's. Hmmm, good idea!!",-1,0
"The food here is very good and fresh. Ambiance is not great but is on par with most Greek restaurants in this price range. I would have given 4 stars, except their website says they are open on Sunday and they definitely are not. I have been by twice to check. Now I see another yelp review that says this was pointed out to the restaurant last fall. This is really inconsiderate to the customers. Seriously, how hard can it be to change the hours on the website?",-1,0
"01/05/13  2.5 stars.  Came here on a Persian coworker's suggestion I try it.  I was informed by the nice young man that Taste of Greek was out of the steak pita that my coworker told me to check out.  (Since I try to avoid chicken and lamb due to food allergies, steak and chick peas are the only proteins I'd be considering, anyway.)  Since steak was not an option tonight, I went for a la carte items of chicken pita ($7.95), regular hummus ($4.50 or $4.95), and a couple of falafel balls ($1 for two pieces).  Surprisingly, it took longer than I expected to prepare the falafel balls and pita wrap, which I took as a good sign that they were cooked-to-order.  The hummus was the only one that was pre-prepared, and it came with ONE olive.  A rather tasty olive at that, and it was a pity that it was all by its lonesome, since the bite that included it was the only time I thought the hummus was worthwhile... Still, I've kept the container in the fridge, as it still is a protein source.  (However, now that I think about it, if it's not organic, then really, I'm not doing my body any favors- SAY NO TO GMO!)  The falafel balls were piping-hot and tasty, albeit a tad too salty.  Again, I'm going to assume the chick peas weren't organic and the soybean oil used to fry it wasn't either, so this may be the last time I ever speak of them...  The first few bites of the pita wrap didn't win me over UNTIL I remembered to add the tzatziki sauce I'd requested to be on the side (cuke allergy).  After I'd slathered on the homemade sauce, it was  very good!  Worthy of a few allergy symptoms, even.    I'll be coming back to give the steak wrap a try, but I doubt I'll be back for the other items, unless ToG  goes organic.  If you know of any organic mediterranean restaurants, please let me know!  :)",-1,0
"Good place to grab lunch. They use fresh ingredients and the serving size/price is reasonable.  - Greek Salad: Pretty good. There were lots of fresh veggie toppings and a ton of feta. I prefer more lettuce on my salads, but that's my only complaint. The tahini sauce it came with tasted a little spoiled, thankfully it was on the side. For only 50 cents more I got a huge soft pita on the side. - Falafal: Really good. Most restaurant's falafal balls are dry and plain tasting, so I was very pleasantly surprised that these were moist, fresh, and quite flavorful. Highly recommend! - French Fries: Mmm their fries are great. Big, crispy, and soft in the middle. - Gyro: I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend really likes the gyros. They look very sizable, and the tzatziki sauce is very good.",-1,0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Should have been 5 stars, but let me explain:  On a girls-only trip, a friend of mine and I visited Scottsdale, AZ over Labor Day weekend and decided to try this place out.  My friend and I split the Fattoush (Mediterranian) Salad and thought we'd died and gone to Heaven!  There was so much of it, we were able to save 1/2 of it for the next day's lunch.    My only complaint is that on Sunday, we wanted to go back and get another couple of salads (YES, IT WAS THAT GOOD!) for dinner.  We knew that it would be closed on Monday, so we Googled the website to find out what the hours were on Sunday (they close at 6pm) and we actually left the swimming pool early so that we could be at the restaurant by 5:15 pm (in case they wanted to close a little early since the next day was a holiday).  Guess what?  They were CLOSED!  The sign on the door said that they were closed on Monday, 9/3 - nothing about closing early on Sunday, and I even checked the hours of operation sign to the right of the door to make sure their closing hour was 6pm on Sunday.    They didn't just miss out on me and my friend, we watched 2 other cars with people walk up to the door and do the same thing we did (pull on door, read sign, look at hours of operation sign to the right of door, look at watch, lean into glass with hands cupped around eyes to see if someone was hiding inside, pull door handle one more time, shake heads and walk back to car.)  SO DISAPPOINTED!  Had they been open at 5:15pm on Sunday,  I would have given them 5 stars.  Hopefully they'll still be there next year when we go back to Scottsdale!  I'm buying a week's worth of food, in case they decide to close early without notice again!",-1,0
Ehhh I'm a hummus snob and I'm still determined to find a hummus spot. They put too much garlic in their hummus and the falafels are just okay.,-1,0
The food was very flavorful but I don't recommend getting it to-go. I live about 5 minutes away and by the time I got home the pita bread was completely soggy and I couldn't enjoy half of the fries for the same reason. The parts I did get to eat were very delicious though. The staff was very friendly as well. It was kind of pricey but that's looking like the norm for all the Greek places I've been to. I probably won't go back only because I've had better at either My Big Fat Greek Restaurant or The Greek Pita in the Tempe Market Place food court. Still if you live close by and are craving some greek it's a good place to go.,-1,0

Our meal was ok. Nothing to write home about. How does an italian restaurant run out of Bolognese?,-1,0
"The Good - The food was very good, which, of course, is most important.  The Bad - My biggest disappointments were, number one, all the glasses on the table for 4, both water and wine, were horribly water spotted. I've never seen such a thing in a restaurant. Number two, my husband had a soft drink and asked for a refill. He was charged for 2 soft drinks. Who charges for refills these days??  Very disappointing and petty.",-1,0
I would give 4 stars because the food was pretty fantastic but...read on. Great place to sit at the bar for late night happy hour!  Bartender was super friendly and service was good. We ordered a ton of food and had quite a bit in front of us. A closed bottle of olive oil fell over the front of the bar.  A greasy rude dude that worked there picked it up and made some comment about how EXPENSIVE it was and how that was the last bottle until the delivery tomo. Really!!! An italian restaurant and I potentially spilled the last bottle of Olive oil in the entire place and may have put them line down for the night....Keep up the customer service buddy!,-1,0
"I had never heard of this place but went here for a rehearsal dinner. I was pleasantly surprised. We sat on the back patio which was great and our waiter was fantastic. The antipasto was delicious, as was the bread and oil for dipping. I wasn't able to order my own food since there was such a large group which was unfortunate, but they served a wide variety of pizza, and it was all pretty tasty. I would definitely eat here again.",-1,0
"Decent Italian. Nothing more nothing less. Good service, and the staff was very friendly. Food was Eh, nothing that wowed or amazed me. I got the lasagna which was recommended to me by the waiter, and it was your average lasagna. A little too much cheese put on the top. Would most likely not return.",-1,0
My gfs and I went for happy hour.  You have to sit at the bar to get the discount pricing.   They pour large bottles of wine and pizza was tasty.. Looking forward to trying their pastas next!,-1,0

"Food is good, but service is lacking. I had called in advance to inform that I would be bringing in my mother for her 80th birthday. The person I spoke with mentioned that they would have a special table ready for her and a cake. When we arrived, we were instructed to pick our own table; no special preparations.  Had to ask multiple times for the parmesan cheese which, when finally brought out, was in a grinder that kept breaking on the waiter. At the completion of the meal that waiter asked, ""done yet""? How about, ""ma'm are you finished yet""?  The olive oil was rancid.   For the price of lunch ($74 for two), will not be back.",-1,0
"Our introduction to Pasta Brioni was lackluster. I had heard great things about the food from friends and finally decided to try it for my birthday. We arrived a little after 8 pm on a weeknight and immediately felt like we were intruding. They weren't closing for another hour yet the reception was cold. We sat alone in the main lounge, which was fine. Our waiter was very matter-of-fact and didn't make any attempt at chitchat; again the cold shoulder. The food was tasty and the portions ample but not worth the price, in my opinion.  There's other Italian restaurants I'll try first before coming back.",-1,0
"I really wanted this place to be good, especially after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp. But sadly, it was just mediocre.  I was expecting good crusty italian bread for starters.  What I got was a hand delivered small roll, neither crusty or warm. My wife commented how it was mealy. It was. My Pasta E Fagioli had a slight vinegar taste and not balsamic vinegar, white vinegar. Yuk. My wife ordered chicken parm with a side of meatballs. The meatballs were just ok. The chicken parm had a good flavor but the presentation looked bad. Sparsely melted cheese that looked like it had just barely melted in a microwave and not the lightly browned cheese evidencing time spent in a hot oven.  I had the four cheese rigitoni which was actually pretty good.  After the bread, the soup, and the yukky looking chicken parm, we chose not to spend any more $$ on desert.  Service and ambiance was above average, but the food wasn't quite what we were hoping for, not for the money anyway.  Our search goes on for good Italian in the Phoenix, Scottsdale area.  Overall, not a bad place, but for the $$, I'll get a bottle of Rao's sauce, some meatballs from Guidos, and save the grief.",-1,0
"I'm not sure I will ever go back. Went to Pasta Brioni with my mom on Friday and after we were seated our server came over and said, ""Well let's get this show on the road."" I guess the restaurant was expecting a large party so they didn't want to work before the party arrived. Our server brought us menus finally after he brought two waters and a basket of bread and we were told they only served pizza in the To Go room of the restaurant. I asked the server if we should take our waters over and he said ""Nahhhhhh"" so I left them there, fully expecting we would be offered water in the separate part of the restaurant. I was wrong. Needless to say I had to ask for plates for our pizza, we were going to dine in but found out they were expecting a large party in that room as well. Right as they were about to bring our pizza and pasta (spaghetti with mushrooms/very little sausage for  $13) we asked if they would just box our food up to go and we left. Bad timing. Mediocre pasta. Decent pizza. But I certainly won't rush back. $30 for poor service, no thank you.",-1,0
"Nice staff, good choices on menu.    We ordered the calamari-- not sure how you screw fried calamari up but Pasta Brioni managed to, in the fryer too long.  The pasta meals we ordered were decent.  Nothing great or special.  They handled a large group well though and the service was good.  Oh and the bread is really good too.",-1,0
"It's been years since I've eaten at Pasta Brioni. The food was as good as I remember and a good bang for the buck. The service however was a little off the mark. We were seated in the back which may have caused delays in our server getting to and checking up on us but that is no excuse, we are in your restaurant and should be treated as well as customers in the front room.",-1,0
"Service was pretty good. Our waiter was really nice, but kept calling my mom sweetheart and we thought that was a little weird. It was super hot in there, to the point I felt sick. Kind of hurried to get out of there, because of this.  They started with water, then brought one roll on a plate to each of us, then our drinks and meal.  I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and iced tea and my mom ordered originally the Chx Marsala, but he recommended the Chx Eggplant meal (forgot name) so she got that. Food was pretty good. Nothing too amazing. Bill was $40 almost for two of us. Just expected more for the price of it. Will I go back? Eh? Maybe....",-1,0
"I only mention this because of all the women reviewers commenting on ""the hot waiters"".  I remember a very friendly and attractive female bartender- This is Scottsdale, home of the beautiful people.  Anyway, I like this place- Not real pricey or pretentious (rare in this town).  Good basic food and drinks- great service, esp at the bar!!  Suggest Linguini and clams or calamari.",-1,0

"I've eaten their food at least a dozen times, but have always gotten it To-Go.    Having tried several dishes, I can honestly say the food is decent.  It's not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst.  The sauce is always bland, no matter which dish I order.  I always need to spice it up, once I bring it home.  Pricing is okay.  Usually spending around $35 for 2 dishes (my wife and I).    I've never utilized their delivery service, but overheard employees telling customers that they commonly run an hour and a half for delivery.",-1,0
"I went here last night despite quite a few yelpers giving it a thumbs  down. But like most things.. you kinda just have to experience it yourself no matter what others say. Well the funny thing is I went to the cafe side which was completely empty and the menu was pretty sparse compared to the website, so right then I was disappointed and wished my date wasnt on his way to meet me there......UNTIL my date found me and brought me to the ""other side"" which was jam packed and full of energy.. not to mention offering an extensive menu. Yay and thank god! it turns out the other side is more of the ""to go"" side. Okay so the rolls came out and they werent awful but they weren't warm and doughy which is what i had expected from other reviews.. but that was okay. If they had been warm and doughy I would have eaten 10 so it was actually a better situation. We started with the caprese salad which they automatically split on 2 separate plates, which I thought was great initiative. I have to say that was probably the BEST Caprese I have ever had. Those tomatoes were unspeakably good! To follow I ordered the Antipasta salad it was perefect I had no complaints whatsoever. My date had a seafood pasta, I cant remember which one and he wasn't moaning over it but he definitely didn't complain. So I guess it all depends on what you order..maybe. But I was pleased enough to return sometime and try something else, no question.",-1,0
"The hotel has rejected my review several times, claiming I mentioned other hotels (not true). Doubtless it's because I mentioned the toilet paper in the toilet when we checked in and other signs that the bathroom was used after it was ""cleaned"" (smeary faucet, hair in sink).  The main indication that it was cleaned was the TP roll folded into the little triangle hotels like to use to say, ""Ok, guest, we're ready for you.""  Ok, everybody makes mistakes (although this one's pretty bad for a hotel), so we reported this immediately to the front desk.  They promised to send someone up to the room.  We left for several hours, only to return to find nothing had changed.  The rest of the room was pretty nice, so it's too bad the hotel chooses to react to criticism by trying to hide it.  That just makes me think this is more than a one-off problem.",-1,0
"Pros: This place is in a great place! It's in an area that is walking distance to Target, CVS and lots of restaurants. This neighborhood is currently being developed so it's not like staying in Shadyside or some of the nicer parts but it's safe. The staff in incredibly friendly & the decor is so awesome & modern. The entire hotel is super clean.   Con: I only have 1--the shower. I think that my room is being remodeled and they are almost done but didn't want to miss out on money so; they allowed the room to be occupied. My shower floor was covered with mildew--it's gross. I have shower shoes; so I braved it & I had already unpacked and It was late so I stayed in the room.   I will stay here again BUT only after I check to see if the shower floor is covered in mildew lol. I'll post pictures so you can decide what's best for yo",-1,0
"After seeing this place pop up on Yelp and being featured in a newsletter/blog that I follow I decided to give these guys a try. They're only a 10 minute walk from my house so I thought this would be a great opportunity to find a new brunch spot close to home. I popped in Saturday morning with my girlfriend only to find out that they're doing brunch on Sundays only at the moment.  No matter, I grabbed a tea to go, of which I had 4 choices of loose leaf varieties to choose from. The woman working was very friendly and explained how they're taking things one step at a time and slowly introducing more and more.   Right now this is a great place to hang out during the day to grab a hot beverage and chit-chat with a friend or come in the evening for a cocktail or two. No open Wifi networks popped up during my visit so this may not be the place at the moment to hang out if you're trying to get work done/being a laptop hobo.",-1,0
"Came here for a friend's birthday. Relaxed atmosphere, good selection of beers, moderately priced and good music. The place is a bit heavy on the moustaches and plaid, but a good time was had by all. It's small, so if you've got a big group, get there early!",-1,0
"Northoods brings a decent bar to an area of Toronto that has somehow been devoid of good bars, although it's an awesome place if you like kimchi and soon tofu.  The DRINKS:  --BEER: They have a pretty extensive bottle list, all at rather high mark-ups, 3-4 times LCBO prices.  They have a decent but not amazing draft list.  Lots of focus on Beau's, which is one of the weaker Ontario breweries.  I was astonished to drink a tasty, but standard-production Beau's for $9.50/pint.  Woah, that's crazy-town pricing.  Thankfully, happy hour made it normal for $2 off, but there's no excuse to price a standard non-barrel aged American pale ale like that.  --COCKTAILS:  They have a good cocktail list and apparently a pretty diverse set of ingredients.  I ordered the Vieux Carre, a cocktail I had been looking for here for a while, but it unfortunately was underwhelming.  The flavors were off, fairly watered down...I think the server/bartender/everything else was harried, so I think it spent some time sitting in ice. I also think the vermouth was low quality...not the nice richness that helps balance this drink of say a carpano antica.  This cocktail is also made with 1.5 oz of liquor...for a drink with no mixer, that's but one shot (and at $11).  Maybe that's why they felt so compelled to water it down to make it look presentable in a glass.  The FOOD:  Very limited menu!  Just a few sandwiches...didn't try.  The SERVICE:  Very good when it was available.  When we were there it was pretty full and it seemed like one guy was doing all the waitering, cocktail making, and beer pouring.  He was super friendly and knowledgeable when you had his attention, but we mostly didn't have attention.  On the whole, this place is too expensive for what's on offer.  Not going to rush back.",-1,0

"Meh. My friends were really excited to go to this place, as they had been previously and had really enjoyed themselves. Given the variety of bars in Toronto, this spot is a total take it or leave it. We were a reasonably large group and the servers didn't seem particularly interested in accommodating us even though there was a lot of space available when we arrived (and a reservation had been made) Overall, service was spotty and we were ignored after being there for awhile. Drinks were of average quality and very overpriced. I had a panini that was a bit soggy, chewy, and cold. Probably fine for one drink if you're alone or on a date.",-1,0
"I've had better was what kept repeating through my head throughout dinner. Everything at Hana was decent, but nothing stood out as spectacular.  Perhaps the Chef saves the best ingredients and extra effort for the daily specials, but he certainly didn't spend much time on the bento box, which is my go to when checking out any Japanese restaurant for the first time as if gives you a 'tasting menu' of what the restaurant has to offer. We also had a side of vegetable gyoza.  The Good:   - the Salmon sashimi was quite good, fresh and flavorful - the tempura was great, light and crisp - the pickled vegetables were a nice addition to the standard bento fare.  - the white ginger was nice and refreshing, a step up from the standard pink ginger at most sushi places. - great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy' - quick, friendly service  The Not so Good - the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen)  - the 'chef's choice' sashimi (A white fish, but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was) was flavorless (although not mushy!) - the California rolls were quite disappointing - imitation crab meat and over mayo-ed (why do California rolls even need mayo?) - the wasabi lacked kick. (I'll be sure to ask for fresh if I visit again) - the gyoza tasted like the came pre-made and frozen.  One comment on the BYOB.  While I usually like the idea of BYOB, (especially with no corkage fees), at a Japanese restaurant, i usually like ordering Sake or Japanese beer that can be hard to come at regular retail outlet in Phoenix).  Overall, the experience wasn't memorable.  I may come back when the sushi urge hits (and order off the daily special menu), but it won't be a priority otherwise, especially with all the great other restaurants popping up in uptown Phoenix.",-1,0

"I used to love this place but now we go more out of habit. We got take-out there the other night for a light meal and managed to spend $30 on a regular spicy tuna roll, a specialty roll and side of steamed rice. $30 seriously? And the specialty roll was only 6 pieces which was disappointing given the cost. Looks like Hana is starting to cut back with prices staying steady or increasing. A sign in the front alerts patrons who want to split checks that there will be a $1.50 charge on each bill ""given the recent economy."" I find that pretty unbelievable. Anyways, the food is generally pretty good. One of my favorites is their Hana salad although I was pretty disappointed when they began layering the bottom of the salad with iceberg lettuce instead of the usual mix. Again with the cut-backs. Don't get me wrong. I like Hana alot but I think they are becoming overpriced for food that is good but in an average way comparable to other Asian spots.",-1,0
"After all the love poured out to Hana I decided to hold back my initial impression and give it another shot.  I made sure to order a wide variety of items to make sure I captured the gist what they were putting down.  First up: Miso Soup Very good flavor lots of seaweed, tofu, and seasonings. 2nd: Tuna Tartare Thinly sliced, a little smokiness, a little acidity but a bit disappointing overall.  It was lacking the pop I look for in this dish. 3rd: Octopus balls These were interesting.  Deep fried octopus with some mayo and a light sauce.  Good flavor but the cold middle just didn't work for my palate at all. 4th: Shrimp and Veggie tempura Perfectly breaded tempura.  Light crisp and tasteful.  Only knock was the dipping sauce was too simple and plain 5th: Phili Roll It's hard to make a really bad or really good Phili roll.  This was just as good as any in my book. 6th: Tuna sashimi Unimpressed with the freshness, mouthfeel, and color.  Expected much better pieces from such a highly regarded sushi joint.  Hana has a good ambiance.  Service started out good but kind of faded midway thru.  The price was average to high for the fare.   I understand lots of people love them and as much as I wanted to be in on that love fest I'm just not one of them and I am okay with that.  As overall both visits were just okay for me.  Wasn't great...wasn't bad...just really okay.  It is hard to see me giving them a third chance unless I am really craving ok sushi...",-1,0

If the people that sat down in the table bext to you are too loud then you might not enoy your meal so much. Its like your part of their conversation now, and of course you might be waiting for a while. They should really think about opening a bigger location.",-1,0
"The first time I went to Hana I really enjoyed  it. The Hana Bento Box was great as was the tempura ice cream. The second time I went was o.k. - the spicy tuna was average, but the volcano roll was awesome!

"despite having really good sushi, they bring out the plates SO FAST and (for us) in the wrong order.  we got salad with the sushi, then entrees, then apps.  i asked them to slow down because we literally did not have enough room on the table.  we were told ""that's just the way it is,"" which was kind of annoying.  an acknowledgment would have at least been nice, you know?  but still, the sushi is good and prices are reasonable.  next time, i would definitely stagger my order according to arrival preference, because they won't do it for you.",-1,0
"The sushi is ok-good, not worthy of a 4 or 5 and if you're OK with crowded, noisy, bustling places then Hana is for you.  The staff is very nice and will be as accommodating as they possibly can. It is BYOB and they will keep your drinks chilled for you.   However, it is not the perfect spot for an intimate dinner or first date. You will find yourself muffling your ears and trying to compete with the noise level from every table in the room. Unfortunately my party was seated next to a large table of inconsiderate, obnoxious, cackling chicks who for some reason felt the need to constantly scream WOO HOOO throughout the entire evening. Don't get me wrong I love seeing people have a great time but this was not cool at all. My ears are still ringing from all the screeching.   So here is the low-down on what we had:  Tempura - 2+  Bland at best Squid Salad -  3+  Shrimp Tempura Roll - 3, Fell apart and gummy Spicy Tuna - 3, so so.. Lacked the burn that I'm used to Volcano Roll - 2, Gobs of mayo.. Gag! Baked Green Muscle - 5+ very good.

"This is a serviceable, but not exciting, Americanized Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, it is about the best you can do for Chinese food in the Avondale/Goodyear area.  My wife and I ordered the orange chicken meal, the Mongolian beef meal, and a small hot and sour soup. The meals seem to be a good deal to add several extras to an entrÃ©e for only a dollar or so. Choosing the meal upgrade trades out your white rice from the standard entrÃ©e for some lo mein noodles and some fried rice. In addition, you get a single vegetable eggroll and a single fried cheese puff. These extras add volume and variety to your meal without being particularly interesting or delicious. From a food-volume-for-price perspective, it is a good deal, but you shouldn't expect any of the extras to be special. The eggroll in particular was extremely subpar, As it reminded me of an eggroll I could have bought frozen and cooked at my own home. The cheese puff was delicious, but then again it's difficult to screw up fried dough with a lump of cream cheese in the middle. The ""fried rice"" really looks to be nothing more then some rice which was made brown by some kind of unremarkable sauce. The lo mein was similarly disappointing, there was very little to it other than noodles and some sauce, although the sauce did add a nice flavor. The hot and sour soup was one of the high points, as the broth was a deep rich brown with a little bit of thickness to it, it had a generous amounts of tofu cabbage mushrooms etc. and the hot and sour flavors were nicely balanced.  My wife's orange chicken was tasty, but literally included nothing other than the chicken and the sauce. It did not even include the standard steamed broccoli to add a little bit of vegetable into the meal. There wasn't even the pretense of adding something healthy here, and the vegetables were sorely missed. The Mongolian beef was quite delicious but similarly unhealthy. It consisted of reasonably tender chunks of beef extremely large amount of sauce, and green onions along with slices of regular onion which had been stirfried with the beef. From my experience this is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Mongolian beef.  My biggest complaint about the restaurant was the lack of variety on the menu. They were probably only about 10 different beef dishes, a handful of vegetable dishes, seven or eight seafood dishes, and the same number of chicken dishes. I couldn't find a single item on the menu with eggplant in it. What kind of a Chinese restaurant doesn't have eggplant and beef on the menu? There were a handful of Chinese/Thai offerings, but as someone who greatly enjoys Thai food, I would never risk ordering even a simple curry from a restaurant like this.  So long as you're expecting cheap Americanized Chinese food, you will get what you pay for. I can see us returning to this restaurant for that purpose at some point, but not often. Make sure what you like to order is on the menu before going, because even certain standard offerings maybe missing.",-1,0
"Been living here now for about 7 months, I was going to review it sooner but I wanted to give it a fair review. I will start with my actual unit. I LOVE my loft. The Wolf appliances and design of the unit is great. We furnished our own washer and dryer as if you get the one management provides it's a cheap connected stackable that washes 2 pairs of jeans if your lucky - not too happy about that especially when paying $1350 a month for an apartment. When moving into the unit be prepared to clean your unit. Whoever they have preparing the units doesn't do the best job i.e. floors will need mopped possibly steamed cleaned, will need to wipe down doors and windows cabinets etc. I consider these little things but when commanding the rental rates they do you would think it would be done right. Maintenance here has been the biggest issue for us and seems to be the common problem when talking to my neighbors. We submitted a work order for our blinds and no one bothered to come even a week later. We eventually fixed it ourselves. The people working in the office are great and are available for questions. Overall it has been a great experience and we will be renewing our lease. Would have given a higher star rating but I think the maintenance issue needs to be addressed.",-1,0

I get the whole loft thing but, I always tell my friend that ""if someone breaks in, you'd be screwed...no where to hide!""  2. Security. LIKES - the area in general is kinda shady so, security at the gate is always a plus! DISLIKES - uhmm... how do I say this? THE SECURITY IS WEIRD!  Like normal/social ppl, I made small talk with the guard while he rang my friend; and I swear to you, the guard showed me pics on his phone, told me (almost) his whole life story, AND let 3 cars in ahead of me.

"The reason I rated it ok was due to the service.  The food was excellent.  It is a small restaurant and we went on a Friday evening (myself and another person) We were told we would have to sit at the bar because the tables for 4 people were being held for people of 3 or more. the bar is right at the front door so I didn't feel comfortable sitting there. I spotted an empty table for two near the window and asked if we could sit there. We would told yes (why she didn't ask us if we wanted that table in the beginning, I don't know). We were given menus and ordered our food with just water for beverage. It does take a while for the food to come but the portions are good and the food was delicious. I had the ESCABECHE DE POLLO (chicken garnished with sautÃ©ed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar), my partner had the ARROZ CON POLLO (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & chicken). The waitress never came back to refill our water or check on us. Customer service is big with me and even though the food was excellent, I'd have to rethink going back.",-1,0
"I've driven by this hidden Peruvian Cafe many times and never noticed it until tonight. Truly a hole-in-the-wall from the outside but a nice cozy restaurant in the inside. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. I had the Yuca Fritas appetizer and Mariscos con Arroz entreÃ©. I enjoy the Yuca and the two sauces. Some of the Yuca pieces were hard and stringy, but the rest was quite nice. The Mariscos were a disappointment. A few pieces of the seafood were very hard and chewy like they were seriously overlooked. These pieces were inedible. Most of the rest of the dish was good, but not great. I was expecting more flavor that would make this uniquely Peruvian. I will come back again and order a completely different entreÃ©. I want to like this place and I think it's definitely worth another shot.",-1,0
"I am a big supporter of family owned business so I decided to stop by and see what all the fuss is about. I have never had peruvian food before so I can't really compare my experience to another peruvian restaurant.   The lot is small and it's kind of hard to park.  The service is good.  The server was really friendly and he tried to give us recommendations.  I ordered the Lomo Saltado and it was flavorful, but I didn't see the difference between that and the nacho fries that you get at Filibertos for half the price. Now, don't get me wrong.  It was a cool experience, but when we got the bill, it was a little much for an appetizer sampler, a drink, one entree, and dessert. I didn't even end up with a doggie bag for the price we paid. I didn't expect to pay as much as what we had paid, but I know they have to pay their bills.  It's a  business.  I get it.   I just don't know if I would justify the price and value of the food to come back.  If you have never had peruvian food, come on over though and try it. At least once.",-1,0
"We decided to live up to our hype of being open-minded and try something unique to Phoenix (i.e., not Mexican; not Vietnamese; not Chinese; etc.).  And that's how we ended up at El Chullo; though, to be fair, we almost DIDN'T end up at El Chullo's.  A previous reviewers comment about parking being limited is like saying Marlon Brando was slightly overweight towards the end.  Let's just say, the parking lot is shared with other businesses; the ""lot"" is about one car wide; and one has to do fancy gyrations to park and withdraw one's car IF one can get a spot.  After driving around three times, we parked in the printing shop's lot across the street (which, I'm sure, will thrill them to no end when/if they read this).  Go during the standard 9 to 5 business hours and you may find yourself outta luck or risking a tow.  Alas, the parking spots are not the only thing small about El Chullo.  In fact, ""small"" pretty much describes it all:  the parking. the restaurant, the portions.  I was rather amused (bemused) by the comment from one of the reviewers that the portions are ""very large"".  Really?  VERY large?  Perhaps for someone who survived  internment at Sherrif Joe's Tent City or who usually dines on those diet programs' pre-packaged food (served in upscale concentration camps).  Granted, this is not to say that the portions were pretentiously small like a la carte francais food; they were perfectly acceptably sized for people, who eat like they're supposed to  (translation:  non-Americans).  We, however, are of the MOO crowd, so for us, all of dinner was something akin to ""snack"".  (Hey, I workout, get off my case!).  We started out with the appetizer platter for $14.95 and chose the Chicken Causa Rell; the Papa Rellena; and the Papa ala Huancaina.  Presented very artistically, I would not say it was an appetizer for two AMERICANS.  Taste was quite good and unique, though the standout taste was potato (hardly a surprise since ""papa"" means 'potato').  I had a very spicy cerviche mixto and my other half, the escabeche de pollo.  Both very good -- the latter served with rice and a small portion of cold, sweet potato -- but we weren't exactly unbuckling our belts at meal's end.  Again, like I said:  not small, but not big by the usual, middle-class American standards, where the men are men, eat like men, and doctors buy brand new cars every month with all the money they get from bypass and pacemaker surgeries.  Nuff said.  The diet Inka Cola, colored like Mountain Dew but tasting like cream soda, is good, but $2.00 a can?  For both of us, the bill came to $46.41 without tip.  Not tragic, but a bit overboard for the quantity.  Maybe reasonable considering the uniqueness of the food.  The 20% tip for Omar, however, was well in line.  Attentive service without being overbearing and very accommodating.  That's one thing I really can't make any complaints about (and as you see, I have no issue complaining).  While I agree with the other, previous 17 reviewers that this is a very nice restaurant, I am not wowed enough to give it 5 Stars.  Those who read my reviews know I'm not generous with my highest rating and you've got to earn it.  For those looking for something different, tasty and served with good attitude, this restaurant is just fine.  If you're a big eater, don't expect to come here and not want something more afterwards.  No one there looked unhappy and we weren't either ... just not full.",-1,0
"Food was decent. Good cerviche. Fried fish was a bit heavy. Place didn't run their a/c. Checked their thermostat next to the bathroom and it was 91 degrees in the place.

"I used to rate this excellent food a 5, but now only a 3.5 only because the price increases.

Unfortunately, I won't be back soon but that's only due to the recent price increases.",-1,0
"I was in PHX for the day and really wanted some Peruvian food since there aren't many options in Tucson for it. This place had great reviews and a friend of mine also suggested it so I had to try it out. We called ahead of time to get a reservation and they said they could ""likely squeeze us in"" which was strange since there were not many people there when we arrived. We didn't get a very friendly vibe from the service in general. Our table got the fish ceviche, chicken tacu tacu and the seafood tacu tacu to share. The food was really great but it was all really salty! I generally like my food to be salty but it was even too much for me. In the future I would make sure to ask for less salt on the meals. Otherwise it was really flavorful.",-1,0
"Peruvian cuisine is Interesting,  flavorful and varied. El Chullo is a very small restaurant so recommend making reservations. Thee stars only as I thought the staff was not the friendliest and the Sangria was mostly fruit juice and very little wine. The parking lot in front of restaurant is very small with very few spots so be ready to park in the neighborhood.   Ordered the Lomo Saltado, which essentially is slivers of beef with French fries. and while I thought was good, could have had more meat considering the price of $ 14.95 . El Chullo is not an inexpensive restaurant. A word of caution, the restaurant closes early on Sundays at 7 P.M so get there early.",-1,0

"First time to Hana...it's in my hood and I've been wanting to try it.  Favorable reviews from others, so my neighbors and I decided to go.  Very good food (not up to par with some other Japanese spots we love in other cities, but still very good).  We were having a wonderful time, enjoying conversation while paying the bill, and no longer than a few minutes after our bill was paid, the owner (we suspect) came over to our table and ASKED US TO LEAVE!  ""I'm sorry, but there are people waiting outside...."" she said.  We were stunned!  First time in the place, had to leave to go buy wine as we didn't know there was no alcohol, but still ended up having a really good meal until the end.  Now, it was 8:45pm on a Wednesday when we were asked to leave so the people waiting could sit (don't know why just we were asked to leave).  We walked out to see three people (one party) waiting outside the door.  The evening mood was totally changed.  I've never been asked to leave...anywhere...even totally hip, very busy spots in Chicago, Denver, LA.  Weird.  Not sure if we'll go back which is too bad since the food was very good.",-1,0

"I have to admit, the stellar Yelp reviews may have caused my expectations to get a little out of control.  A few of the issues:   *Service felt ""hover-y.""  It's hard to have a relaxing dinner when it feels like people are waiting for you to leave.    *Sushi did not taste terribly fresh.  We may have hit an off night but I was a bit disappointed with the quality.    *The sushi menu is fairly limited and unfortunately, I didn't see the four rolls on special written on the blackboard until after we ordered.    The staff *were* very nice and it was a pleasant enough experience but given other options available, I probably wouldn't return.",-1,0
"If I had to choose one word about Hana it would be (drum roll please....) inconsistent. I keep going back, so that's got to say something (however, there aren't many other options in Central Phoenix, so that doesn't hold a TON of weight, per se)  I've been going here off and since they opened, and the food is pretty good. Service can be a bit off, I've even had rude service a time or two. On the flip side, I have also had some pretty good experiences (all though I almost always get takeout, ain't really diggin the BYOB thing. It was cute at the beginning, but after two years? really?).    My wife and I generally get the baked mussels, which are decent. I tried the Yakibuta today (slow roasted pork) which I really liked. The rolls are average, nothing to write home about (by home, I mean Seattle so I guess I could be a bit bias)  Overall this place is pretty good for the area, but it is a bit on the high-price side. If there were more options in the local area, no doubt they'd have to lower their prices a bit. Based on an article I read in New Times, there's going to be a Stingray Sushi opening up in Biltmore some time this year, so that may give Hana a run for it's money. My final verdict, meh.....",-1,0
"Stopped in the other night to grab some sushi after a seeing a movie. The place is small, but has a good friendly vibe.   The food - There were 4 of us and we decided to share. We had 3 rolls - spicy tuna (very good), hana roll (very good), and shrimp tempura roll (very good). We added some nigiri to that as well - tuna, snapper, yellow tail. All pretty standard items. Overall, the food was very good. The fish was fresh and the portion sizes were good as well.  Why, one might ask, do I only give Hana 3 stars? Well, the bill came and after tip it was $160. Four people with no booze.   Just seems like better value can be found at some other places.   One man, two cents.",-1,0

"My boyfriend and I dined at Hana tonight, and despite the numerous four and five star reviews, I was not too impressed.  I found the prices to be pretty steep for smaller portions than most places, and the food to be of only moderate quality.  I did appreciate the authentic atmosphere, it was perfect for our date night.  However, my boyfriend and I found ourselves a little creeped out by our server who paced the small restaurant while we decided what we would order, and lingered near the table just a little bit too long every time he checked on us.   All in all, the food was decent, but overpriced, I will be sticking to Moto on 16th street and Glendale.",-1,0
"I like Hana, and the service here is pretty great. I definitely think the quality of ingredients is up there, but I don't think the consistently higher price points justify the lackluster presentation and small portions.   Located in its own small plaza, Hana sports sparse tables in a dimly lit interior. Perhaps the dimness is for an intimate ambiance, perhaps it's to keep the inside cool, but it bordered on being difficult to see. Service was attentive and considerate, to the point where our initial host asked if there were any food allergies and our waitress seemed psychic in anticipating tea and soda drink refills.  $15 Rainbow Roll: I rarely mention pricing, but it seems that most of the rolls here are $15 or above. That would be fine if the presentation, portion, and quality all justified it, but I think this roll only did one out of the three. The fish was indeed fresh, but the roll seemed almost sloppily made, with one end obviously devoid of fish. The rolling was also not done well, and the roll fell apart quite easily while picking up.   $15 for Spider Roll: I honestly don't think I've ever seen a Spider Roll priced at $15 unless it included other fish or expensive ingredients. I expected this to be larger than the standard six-piece soft shell crab roll, but it wasn't. Again the ingredients were good, and the soft shell crab was freshly fried with a nice light batter. But again the roll fell apart easily, and the pickled carrot inside was clumsily cut and took up too much space within the already-sparse roll.   Uni and ankimo nigiri: I was so excited that there was uni and ankimo nigiri that night, and of course I had to try both. The uni was fresh and ankimo creamy, but the sushi rice had so much rice vinegar that I had a hard time tasting the delicate flavors of uni and ankimo. After the initial bite where I ate the nigiri in one piece, I took the uni and ankimo off to eat sashimi-style so that the rice wouldn't overwhelm them. Perhaps it's the norm in Arizona (I haven't tried enough places here to tell yet), but the ankimo was also twice as expensive as I'm used to.   $3 for hot tea and $2.50 for soda (free refills). Not a big deal, but it also seems that most sushi places here don't offer complimentary hot tea. Just a tidbit if you're used to it like I initially was. I'm conflicted about Hana; I may come back for the fresh ingredients, but part of me thinks that the price point and other factors don't justify the product.",-1,0
"It was Friday night and was out with my son, his fiancÃ© and his mom for Moms and Sons date night, and we picked Hana as the place to go.  We arrived about 10 minutes before opening, honestly we were not even paying attention to time just chatting it up and were like oh it's not opened yet, and so we just waited.  Hana opened and we were given a choice of where we wanted to sit, at this time they were maybe 3 other parties with us, when we sat down we were handed a menu, and after 5 minutes the server came by and asked if we were ready to order, we said no not yet, then after another 2 the server came back and asked are you ready yet, at this time, we quickly ordered some rolls and drinks, and said we need a few more minutes,  drinks were quickly made and then server was back again asking for our order, this time we just quickly figured out what we wanted.  The rolls came out, some California rolls, Spicy Tuna Roll, Vegas Roll, all the rolls were good, the spicy tuna was my favorite!  For my meal I went with the Miso Ramen, it came with ramen noodles, charred pork, green onion & seaweed and I added a dashi soft boiled egg to it.  The broth had great flavor, the pork and veggies were delsih, the soft boiled egg was a little over cooked to be a soft egg, it just didn't have the thick runny yoke that adds creamy texture to the broth, but overall this is a great bowl of ramen for 15 bucks.   Just mere seconds after I put my spoon down our server came to the table to ask if I was done, and I said yes, and my bowl was quickly taken away.  Our entire time at Hana was apx 35 minutes if that, it felt completely rushed, granted it was a Friday night, but there was no line and no one waiting to be seated, and not even  1/2 the restaurant full, but clearly they only wanted us there to eat and leave, no side talking and they did show frustration with us when we did not have our orders ready to be taken. Being rushed ruined the entire dining experience, sometimes you just feel unwanted and this was one of those situations.    I have been to Hana before, and have enjoyed it and have many friends that enjoy it too, but because of the rushed service, when it wasn't even busy has left a bitter memory with me and my return factor is pretty low.",-1,0
"Peruvian food is eclectic. It's accessible. It embraces multiple cultures and influences from ancient Aztecs to contemporary and cosmopolitan Lima. It's both familiar and exotic. And when it's done well, it can be both hearty and elegance. Superb ceviche,followed by an equally great rice with seafood and shared a dish of green linguini with a pesto sauce that was delicious. Can't wait to go back to try more items.",-1,0
"The lomo saltado, signature Peruvian dish, was quite disappointing. The papas a la huancaina was disappointing as well - I guess the sauce was fine but needed more of the expected Peruvian ""kick"" aka yellow chili. Finally, the chupe de camarones soup tasted good but only had 5 regular size shrimp and 1 jumbo shrimp in it - seriously I counted - so it was not worth the price :(  I was so excited to try a Peruvian place in PHX but maybe because I was expecting to much I felt the place wasn't very good and would probably not go back.",-1,0

"Passing through Phoenix for one night and was so excited to find a Peruvian restaurant nearby. They are generally few and far between out here in Arizona! So I was excited to try it out but my experience was just... meh. Maybe I should have stuck to the tried-and-true like ceviche or Lomo saltado or aji de gallina, but I was developing a cough and a sore throat so I wanted chicken soup, and so ordered aguadito, a cilantro-based chicken soup on their menu. It was much too salty and the broth was literally green instead of being clear - though that's probably the way it should be, I don't know because I have never had this particular soup before.  The ambience is that of a little hole in the wall family-run restaurant and the service was fine. If the opportunity presented itself I might go back to try some of the mainstay menu items, but I wouldn't run back.",-1,0

"There's not many restaurant options in this part of town. I heard good reviews from people that live in the area, that is was reasonably priced and decent quality sushi.   From the outside, Guirei doesn't look too exciting. There is patio which was closed given the cold weather. But don't judge a book by its cover, Guirei offered a cozy dining experience inside, with low lighting against dark furniture. As well, the windows are big so you get a nice view of the street/  We started off with warm sake-an excellent beginning on a cold and rainy evening! Service was fast and attentive. We ordered shortly and our food arrived within...5-10 minutes.  They did start the meal with an amuse bouche---fried sushi? lol tasted good. This was followed by a bowl of soup with thin noodles, not sure what exactly it was called, but tasted yummy.  I had the dragon roll-on the sushi quality scale, I would say it was above sushi on bloor, but not at the level of a high end sushi place. The fish selection was fresh tasting. I really enjoyed it. My friend had the dinner special with teriakyi salmon. It was a large serving size, he could barely finish it! He enjoyed his meal and agreed the quality level was above average.  All in all, a good dining experience. The food was affordably priced. The ambience itself was relaxed. I would say the tables were half filled, and this was on a weekday evening.  I would return to Guirei again for lunch or dinner. Definitely a go to place for waterfront locals :)",-1,0
"PROS: A nice quiet spot on the waterfront, including a patio out front. Good sushi/sashimi plus other items (like Bibimbap). CONS: The interior could use a fresh color/coat of paint, and staff must do a better job of providing the bill in a timely manner; often times I have to go find a sever in order to pay the bill!",-1,0
"Decor, atmosphere is average.  Food is good, with a very average/fair pricing, comparable to many other sushi joints.  I get take out when I am too lazy to travel farther for better or cheaper sushi joints.  Service is OK, turnover of servers is high, so service is something that will be a hit or miss.  Guirei is average at best.",-1,0
"Quite happy to find this place around the corner from  Billy Bishop airport.  I had the deluxe bento box.  Was nothing spectacular but it was good and very reasonably priced.  Service lacked for what was a very slow day.  I think some of that was lack of english fluency so I'll let it pass.   I was happy with the food, seemed fresh and it was reasonably priced.  I suspect it will be my supper location before flights in the future.",-1,0
"Pricey but not prohibitive, Guirei gets my vote for prompt, polite, and accommodating customer service (if not the most generous of sushi servings). Given a choice between another neighbourhood sushi restaurant, Mi-Ne on Bremner, I'd go here, for the superior customer service alone.  At Guirei, you can customize your roll with extra charges but no fuss and no attitude. Plus, Ikura is on the menu, which is key for Ikura fans.  I've had the Uni filled Viagra roll twice and ordered Uni sushi, Ikura,Tobiko sushi, Unagi, salmon sashimi, miso soup as well as the Alaska roll: all served fresh, all delicious. The miso soup was served hot, the fish was fresh, and our meal delivered without a glitch. Out of 3 visits, I have had 3 positive dining experiences at this location.   Our waitress was very attentive, refilling our tea and water promptly, and easily accommodating our request to have the Uni served separately (boyfriend is allergic to shellfish). We were seated promptly and served with equal speed.   Note to large groups: dinner time seems to be especially busy for this location, and in my recent experience, it has been filled with groups of customers around 7.30pm: make a reservation.   So why the 3 stars? The sushi servings, while fresh, are smaller in size, comparatively speaking. And the prices, in direct comparison to Gonoe Japanese restaurant (located on the Queen's Quay) is more expensive, sometimes by a dollar per order. However, the quality of the fish is high, and I have eaten well on every visit.   In a pinch, this place delivers a good meal, in a convenient location. My vote: Ikura Girl approved.",-1,0

"Restaurants along the harbourfront are surprisingly limited for a tourist area. With options such as Shoeless Joes and Swiss Chalet I would say that Guirei is one of the better selections in the harbourfront neighbourhood.   Guirei's appearance is like any average sushi restaurant I've been to in Toronto. Unexpectedly large on the inside, the restaurant is dimly lit with very simple dÃ©cor, creating a casual dining atmosphere. The noise level of the restaurant is also quiet but that was probably due to the fact that there were only a few customers eating there.  The food was OK. They had a vast amount of items on their menu offering a few ""dishes"" that veered from the typical sushi menu but mostly all were staples. Portion sizes of the food were decent and the overall taste was not mind blowing but not bad.   To start, I was craving something deep fried. I decided to try their ""Soft Shell Crab"" and the ""Agedashi Tofu"".  The Soft Shell Crab was exactly what I expected it to be - battered, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce. In terms of taste, there wasn't anything spectacular about it. The crab was subtle in texture and the meat was juicy...and tasted like crab (surprise!). The Agedashi Tofu consisted of fairly large tofu cubes, also deep fried, and topped with bonito flakes. On the first bite, the tofu is crispy but the middle is soft. The sauce it was served in wasn't too salty but was flavourful enough to complement the tofu.   For the main, the ""storm roll"" caught my eye on the menu. It consisted of deep fried salmon with avocado, lettuce, and green onion all rolled into a very big fat sushi roll. It had a predominant salmon taste with a hint of spice. I didn't think the lettuce belonged in the roll as it didn't really add anything to it. It was an unnecessary, soggy ingredient that would not have been missed.  Overall, the food and the service were very good. The waitress was friendly and we didn't wait very long for the food. The prices were pretty standard for sushi dining. It wasn't the best in Toronto but definitely worth a try if you are in the neighbourhood.",-1,0
"I lived directly across this spot for a couple years, so it was hard not to give this one a try.   Food is average and is your typical neighbourhood sushi joint. Same bento box offerings, Maki/sushi/ sashimi combos - nothing too amazing to mention. I did order their Seafood Udon regularly though when I wanted something with broth and it always did the trick. Spicy, savoury, and full of seafood - it was one thing I could order again and again.",-1,0
"Well I think one of the reasons why this place only exists is the total lack of restaurants of any sort in this area. There is a similar place just across the road but it looks like it has the same owner because it's no better. Guys, please increase the quality of your seafood. I don't mine paying more, actually. Please get rid of your Sapporo bear on draft. It's just yellow water with alcohol. My wife got a piece of seashell in her miso soup. Think about it: a piece of seashell in a miso soup?! How come?! :-) Staff was friendly though. Anyone who likes sushi and seafood if you are absolutely stuck in that area then try it. Otherwise go up to King st and have something better for your money.",-1,0
"A 3-hour unscheduled break at work without any food prompted me to finally check out this place which some of my coworkers have raved about.  I ended up ordering the Dinner Box A ($21) which came with with your choice of salmon, beef, or chicken teriyaki, your choice of sashimi, sushi, or maki, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and surprisingly, no rice! For $2 more, the Dinner Box B option included rice, sashimi, sushi, AND maki; no tempura though. My dinner wasn't anything special; the chicken was a bit chewy and the teriyaki sauce was pretty watery in consistency. And for $21, it was a bit pricier than the typical bento box.  They do have a separate take-out section in the restaurant, which I imagine they get a lot of orders from, considering the slim pickings in take-out options in the area. While the staff was friendly on the phone and in-person, I, unfortunately, will not be placing any more take-out orders here.",-1,0
"This is an excellent place for lunch, but a little pricey for dinner (hence the 3-star rating). Did I mention that it is virtually in the lobby of where I live? Oh yeah, it is pretty convenient.   For lunch, virtually all of the bento boxes are of excellent value -- $10-14 range that come with the entree, miso soup, tempura, and rice. It is a lot of food. My favorite is the beef terriyaki bento.   The one issue I have with this place is that their sashimi is cut too thick, and many of the pieces are too chewy as a result (or it is a lower-grade cut). I've actually had to COOK the sashimi on a couple of occasions to make it palatable (when I've taken out) -- no joke!   Otherwise, this is a very nice restaurant with a loyal local fan base. I highly recommend it for lunch, but would shy away from it for dinner unless you want to get a bit spendy.",-1,0
"Have eaten here at least 20 times between April 2010 and Sept 2011, usually around 3-4pm, mainly because it's the only sit-down restaurant within a ten minute walk from my work.  Food is generally very fresh.  Pretty good dynamite roll, tempura appetizer, banana fritters for dessert.  I always miss the lunch specials b/c of the time of my work lunch or would've tried that long ago.  So it forces me into getting two a la carte items, usually two of the three above, since I don't want to spend $19.99 on the dinner combo.  Then again, my bill usually comes to around $17 after taxes, so it's 20 by the time I tip.    Service is 90% of the time very friendly and stereotypical of the many Japanese restaurants I've been at in Toronto.  All smiles, politeness, female-only, dressed in cultural style.  Usually they are quite attentive, making sure the complimentary green tea is topped up, your food is good, etc.  A few times I had to wait very long, which I attribute to them being short staffed maybe?  The place is never really busy when I go, often three or four tables occupied inside, and if it's the summer, one or two outside are taken on the patio.  I always prefer the patio if it's nice out, as you can watch planes taking off from the city airport.  Debit & credit accepted.  Liquor licensed.",-1,0

"Went for the 1st time it was pretty busy for lunch on a Monday (considering its fairly new) owners were active in and out of the kitchen, which is always nice to see. Had some good lunch options for a reasonable $8 (comes with small salad and side of rice) I disliked the nickel and dimeing. I added egg rolls and an iced tea and ended up with a just shy of $18 bill... for lunch!! The food was good though. And it's one of the ONLY vegan options within a 5 mile radius of my house that's not a fancy sit down joint. So I'll definitely return. Happy Eating!!!",-1,0
Their food is normally very good and I really like this place a lot. Their food is all vegetarian and a lot of it is vegan or can be made vegan. Their kung pao soy chicken is amazing and my husband and I have gotten it more than once. I went there tonight and got their chow mein. It was pretty gross. It was a bowl of water with some sauce mixed in and noodles and veggies. It would have been really good if the bowl wasn't filled with water. I asked the waiter if he could drain some of the water out and he asked if I meant the sauce. Definitely wouldn't recommend that dish.,-1,0
"I went here a while ago and forgot to write a review.  It was ok but not great.  The atmosphere was very sterile, food was good and service was ok.  I was glad we weren't in a rush as the service definitely wasn't fast.  I would go back again and give it another try.",-1,0
"In town to visit family, and we went to Fresh Mint for lunch. First off, the decor is a bit ""in your face."" Bright and odd. The ""strip mall"" references made by other reviewers are accurate.   Service was S.L.O.W. until the man, who I think owns the restaurant, showed up to save the day. Still, it took a long time to get our food.   We shared the summer rolls, which I think were below average. The wrappers were a bit mushy and I found the rolls to lack flavor. We also got some fried rolls (can't remember the name, but they had yucca root in them... Imperial Rolls maybe?) and they were pretty tasty.   I ordered the Spicy Lemongrass Tofu lunch special. The salad was average ""bag"" salad, but I liked the dressing - flavorful with a kick. The tofu was yummy - in a curry coconut milk sauce - but it was ONLY tofu. I actually love tofu, but I was hoping for a few veggies. I would not order this again w/o requesting they add some broccoli or something. Just too rich of a dish for my taste. My brother got the kung pao chicken which looked Delicious. My husband had pad thai, which was pretty good.   This place was definitely expensive. I was surprised, visiting from the Bay Area, that prices at this place, which resembles a semi-fast food establishment, were so high. Lunch for 6 of us was almost $100.",-1,0
"I ended up having "" soy"" chicken , not a place for meat lovers , less quantity ..",-1,0
"I write this as I use my chopsticks to pick up peanuts from the Kung Pao dish.  I just got lunch and Fresh Mint is really close to my work.  I'd read the reviews and thought it sounded like the best lunch EVER! Eh, it's OK.  The Kung Pao is awesome and everyone's right - you don't even miss the chicken.  I'm not a veg-head, but I do enjoy a good tofu dish.  It came with a side of brown rice, huge plus.  Then, there's the salad.  The bagged-I-can-get-this-at-Safeway-salad.  It's drenched in dressing.  It is seriously nothing more than a bagged salad. I also got the summer rolls.  Really fresh and yummy!  Light, too.  Came with a side of peanut dipping sauce that I would totally fill my bathtub with. Fresh Mint, I like you.  I like the decor.  I like the Kung Pao.  I don't like the slow service nor the ghetto salad.",-1,0
"Mint tomatoes was delicious.  Summer roles were ok. And the island salad was soaked in dressing and missing 2 of the few  ingredients (candied walnuts and dried cranberries).  Will probably go eventually for another try, but will definitely QC the order before leaving (if take out).",-1,0
"We literally live around the corner and I want to LOVE this place, but I have to just like it.  You definitely get a mix of great cooked food or ok bland, and I'm not sure if it's what you order, or who's cooking, or maybe when you go, but they are a bit inconsistent.  When it's on, it's great.  The service IS a little funny, and since it's such a small place, you have to deal with a personality.  Just roll with it... service is always good when someone means well!   I still go regularly, but always with a ""we'll see what we get"" feeling.  It's never bad, so I disagree with the 1star review.  And there are SO few choices in Scottsdale, so take what you get or cook at home.  I would absolutely recommend that you try it for yourself, get a few different things and you'll enjoy.",-1,0
"As a vegetarian (but not vegan) I was psyched to go eat at a place where I wouldn't be limited to appetizers and/or eating off someone else's plate (or having to face idiotic comments like ""just pick the meat off."") The menu was like a smorgasboard of love! Tofu everything! Sweet Lucy, what did I do to deserve this?   Fresh Mint, I so wanted to love you and hold you and call you my own. But I was denied.  I  had the Kung Pao Soy Chicken. It was pretty spicy for my taste, but that may just be because I am a wimp in that area. The decor was blindingly bright,  yet charming. But there were a few downs:  The service was slooooooww....especially for a lunch hour; the guy who served us had stains all over his shirt -- kind of like he'd just run a race or dripped beer on himself. I also saw him flip a tablecloth. Seriously. How gross is that?  I'll probably give it one more try, particularly since they now have $8 lunch specials. Oh, and they don't take American Express. Bummer.  Fresh Mint, I still have hope that someday -- you and I -- fireworks, long walks on the beach, champagne...don't let me down, baby!",-1,0
"Food was delicious and I'd rate it 4 stars. Service, cleanliness, and ambience only 3 stars.   There was a ""help wanted"" sign in the front and they definitely seemed in need of it. This was my first time coming to Fresh Mint so I was eager to hear about our server's favorite dishes. Unfortunately, he wasn't very patient or friendly. Not sure if he was the owner or what but he didn't seem to have enough time to devote to customers and he also seemed to be doing a bunch of jobs at once. People that were ordering takeout seemed frustrated about the wait time. I was also quite surprised they don't offer a kids menu given they are located next door to Modern Milk and across the street from Musicology, which are literally hubs for moms and their kids. I was hoping the server would at least take the time to give some kid friendly recommendations, but he didn't and instead I felt rushed. It was pretty clear they didn't have enough staff to handle everything effectively.  In terms of the ambience, the place wasn't super clean. There was dust behind the serving counter and the soda machine had 3 ""out of order"" signs out of 6 fountain drinks...not a good look. There was also a mildew crust around the entire fountain drink machine - yuck! The furniture and decor were pretty outdated too.  The food tasted great and I actually would return because it really was good. We ordered the fresh summer roll and fresh cucumber roll -- both were indeed fresh but the cucumber roll was better; the summer roll didn't have much flavor. Both came with peanut dipping sauce which was pretty good. For entrees we ordered their rainbow wonder which came with an abundance of vegetables and the sauce was quite flavorful. Not the biggest portions, especially since it wasn't on the lunch menu, cost $11.95, and I didn't have enough for left overs. My friend ordered the kung pao soy chicken which was very flavorful. It was on the lunch menu so it was offered at a reduced price (I believe around $8) but it also wasn't enough for left overs.   All in all, the food was great and I'd return for it but hopefully they fix some of the cosmetic and service issues to make it a more pleasurable dining experience overall.",-1,0
"Kosher and vegetarian. A definite plus. The dishes are delicious and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The servings though, in comparison to their price, are quite small and disappointing. For example, I ordered an appetizer for $6 and it was served as 6 pieces of raw vegetables with a small cup of peanut sauce. Main dish servings are approximately a heaping cup of food. For a small break, try the lunch menu for an array of their popular dishes for $8 each. Servings are still small.",-1,0
"The good: the food was excellent. We will return but not during the day due to the heat.  The bad: the temperature in the restaurant was over 80 degrees.  The two owners were sitting down having lunch so we seated ourself. It took awhile for the owner to deliver menus in an unfriendly manner. Obviously, we interrupted his lunch. We felt as though we were not welcome. Lunch was excellent though a bit expensive. He finally warned up with a smile after delivering the check.  We would try it again but we would not go out of our way.",-1,0
"My first time here! I was able to seat myself. The pho with tofu beef and spring rolls were ordered along with a cup of coffee. I wish they had vegan friendly ""cream"" for the coffee they serve because it does exist but overall decent experience. The customer service was also good here. I'm not sure if I'll be back but for a change AND if I'm in the area, I may consider.",-1,0
"I was actually pretty disappointed with this one. I love the idea of healthy eating and vegan food but this one was just okay. Loving hut and green are much better. I was pretty surprised at the wonderful reviews on yelp. But I guess if you are vegan it is hard to find anywhere to eat. So myself being a meateater, I give it only 3 stars. And that was generious. But if you love vegan food like I do, try green or loving hut!",-1,0
"First, I have to say it's nice to have a restaurant cater to people who choose to eat meat-free. A tip 'o the hat for that...  Upon entering the restaurant, it just had a weird energy. It sort of felt like things were just thrown together. Anybody else notice the bad chi? I still decided to order food, but takeout instead of dining in because of the vibe. I went with the kung pao chicken. I can absolutely imagine some vegans/vegetarians not being able to stomach the texture of the faux meat here. I can only imagine all of the processing they do to turn the soy into what they serve. I don't know what kind of pact they made with the meat gods, but they have the texture and look down to a science. Literally. It made me wonder what kind of graduated cylinders, Bunsen burners and potions they have in the back, with some evil scientist, er, I mean chef at the helm. The array of vegetables in my entree looked and tasted fresh and the sauce was good and added with a light hand, which I appreciate. The portions were great, but NOT for the price. My meal was $13! No drink, no salad, no dessert. Er... Do you know how many burrito bowls that is?! Just saying...  All in all, I would go back, but I would steer away from the faux meat and focus on the salads (and the prices!).",-1,0
"The food is average.  Husband liked it, hence the three stars.  Not the cleanest place.  Biggest criticism is everything in the restaurant is green, like Oz green.  Not appealing.",-1,0
"Mission Statement Revealed: YES, We Have NO Bananas.  Eight month's ago, I was told by the chef's husband/waiter that they were ""out"" of the banana fritters showing on both the in-house and online menus'. Four months later, same response.  When I pressed , and asked what it would take to actually get this item in the future, after now being disappointed twice on the same issue, his revised response was, ""Oh, we don't make those anymore."" With my asking why they remained on the menu, he turned ""sheepish"" and said he ""really should take them off.""  No s***, Sherlock.  To date, he hasn't troubled himself with that, at least not online. Apparently, knowingly disappointing some percentage of customers and not caring enough to right a wrong is just fine here. Bye, then.",-1,0
"Decent Vegan food. I would give points for consistency, quality, and variety. I like that I can get good healthy food here, but this is definitely not my first choice for vegan food.  Few ingredients such as their soy based meat is pretty good. However, they can really work on improving overall taste of their entrÃ©es.  Most of the entrÃ©es I tried have pretty much same type of base sauce, and same type of vegetables. some dishes are loaded with raw boiled vegetables (broccoli, zucchini is standard in all), which kind of offsets the taste. A little bit of seasoning or sautÃ©ed vegetables may work better. their spring rolls are amazing, and their tapioca pudding dessert is great too.",-1,0
Ate here last night.  Food was good.  Service not so good.  We were 7 people including 2 small children.  I made a reservation for 730. When we arrived the table was not ready. We were left squashed in to a table for 4 for about 25 minutes before we were seated.  No offer of a glass of water or temporary seating for all of us.   After we finished out meal we were rushed out and not even offered a dessert menu.  This was already 9 pm and the restaurant wanted to close.  Wish they were more friendly.,-1,0
"Enjoyed their autumn roll with ginger sauce and tasted my friend's dish with tamarind sauce.  Both tasty, healthy, light lunch fare.",-1,0
"I truly wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. I love the concept of this restaurant. I spoke with the chef/owner's husband who was our server and he mentioned that they have a few other Fresh Mint restaurants, one of which is in Hawaii. I ordered the cucumber rolls (appetizer) and my bf ordered the pho. It took an exceptionally long time to get our food after lunch rush hour. While I appreciate that everything is made when you order it... An hour seems like an aweful long time to wait for julienned veggies wrapped in raw cucumber with a side of peanut sauce. The pho followed a few moments later. I liked it but my compadres felt it was less than authentic. Bottom line... Go here if you are in the mood for healthy fair that's vegan friendly and you're not in a rush!",-1,0
"For a strict vegetarian with limited *good* dining out options, I was excited to try Fresh Mint after several friends told me the food was great.   Despite reading many negative reviews about the service, I indeed experienced a waiting time for food that was inexcusable. We were the ONLY 2 people in the restaurant and it took almost 2 hours to get drinks,order, and receive food. The food itsself was about what you'd expect for asian vegetarian, but if I ever came back I would order takeout.   Their ""patio"" is basically in a parking lot facing a strip mall. Not a good ambiance at all, and the decor is tastelessly outdated and drab.",-1,0
"The food is always great, and I love their lemonade. But wait time during lunch is an issue. If there's only two of us, or God forbid it's just me, I often feel like the owner finds it a burden to seat me. Not a good impression.",-1,0
"First off, let's give some praise to the concept: A vegan, vietnamese-style, Kosher restaurant? That's the coolest thing I've heard since someone explained nonstick frying pans to me. Unfortunately, the service can be a bit slow, and a bit weird, but you've got to give them some credit for opening a place like this.  Most of the dishes are composed of rice/noodles, steamed veggies, and one of their vegan meats like chicken, beef, ribs, fish, etc., doused in sauce. It's awesome sauce (saucesome?) but it pretty much negates a lot of the healthier aspects of the dish. Why not wait to add those extra calories with some vegan carrot or chocolate cake instead? As far as recommendations, the lemongrass tofu rolls and green papaya salad are both light, filling and fresh tasting dishes. If you're a sauce-o-holic, opt for the tasty BBQ citrus spare ribs or soy fish in a clay pot.  ....For those of you who don't want to read any of that, refer to the short & sweet version below:  Concept: hell yeah. Service: weird. Selection of ""meat"": awesome. Vegan desserts: much appreciated. Dishes: varied & satisfactory. Sauces: too heavy. Overall: 3.5 stars. I'll probably go back at some point.",-1,0
"I pass this shopping center every day on my way to work and read some great things on Yelp. One of my best friends is vegetarian so I thought it would be nice for us to try it out. We got there around 12:15 yesterday and grabbed the last remaining table. We were greeted promptly and had our order taken within about 5 minutes after being seated. I ordered the fried spring veggie rolls ($6) that were delicious. I kept snacking off the fried crispy pieces of the sides.   For lunch, I had ordered the curry tofu and potatoes ($8). It came with carrots mixed in the curry sauce with rice and salad. I equally enjoyed the salad and curry sauce over the rice. I didn't care for the spongy tofu and would have liked more vegetables in the curry rather than just potatoes and carrots. This lunch was just okay.   The service was horrible. I didn't get my lunch until 12:50 p.m. The owner was aware of it and apologized but apologies don't prevent me from getting back to work on time. When we were ready to pay, it took forever for him to pick up the check. My friend had to flag him down to get his attention. Very irritating. Timely service in a restaurant is important to me. I would have average food and phenomenal service, as opposed to, phenomal food and terrible service.   Overall, the food was decent/mediocre at times with terrible service. It's doubtful I would go back.",-1,0
"I really did enjoy this place. I was reading reviews and noticed quite a few people comment on wait time and lack of service. Luckily, we didn't have any such issues the night we dined in. We waited appx 8-10 minutes for our food. We had the yellow curry and the Imperial Roll Noodles. Yellow curry was good - but it lacked a certain flavor. Satisfying in the sense that it was filling, but not in the sense of authenticity. I definitely can name a few other places I'd rather have curry at. The noodle bowl was on point - loved that they didn't skimp on the veggie rolls. Could've used a little more vinegar sauce though - split between the salad and the actual noodles - it needed just a bit more. I suppose I could've asked... ha!   Service was fine. Nothing too special, but not lacking either. The person whom I assumed was the manager served as the hostess and the person checking people out. He was mostly attentive.  Honestly, this place is a wonderful idea. There's a lot of tasty sounding dishes on the menu and one's that honestly I'd love to come back and try. Prices aren't crazy by any means, but $15 for any of the Chef's Specials - I sorta shrug my shoulders at because they don't seem THAT amazing. Like c'mon, $15 for veg chow mein?? I think I'd rather go to an authentic Chinese restaurant and get my pan fried noodles for $8. Hot pot might be worth it - but the mock meat dishes- not so much.   We definitely want to come back, but it's not at the top of the list...",-1,0
"Not really sure what all the hype is about. Food was pretty bland. We ordered the following: Tofu fresh spring rolls - there was literally ONE strip of tofu ...finger size circumference inside and filled to the gills with veggies - veggies were fresh though. Papaya salad - the most blandest dish - almost like jicama salad, just a bunch of veggies with a dash of lime juice. Lemongrass tofu curry - this was the better of the three but still mediocre. Would I come back? Probably not.",-1,0
"My wife loves the fact that this place is 24/7.  I personally view it more of as your neighborhood pet's ER.  It's awfully expensive for just about everything you get here.  I would shop around for your pet's spa and manicure needs, but they are a professional, well maintained business, and we have high confidence with their facilities for some more of the advanced procedures like dental work.    Honestly the thing I like the least is unfortunately in my case, probably unavoidable.  Every time we visit, we meet a new doctor.  I think maybe twice we've had a doc we remembered.  Not sure if that's a turnover thing, or if perhaps it's a compromise I need to live with for the convenience of some of their ""sure, come get a bordatella shot anytime for $200"" availability; but I'd much rather a doctor get to know my dog a little bit and not get freaked out when my 12 pound fluff ball of terror's chart pops up with a ""Might Bite"" warning sign flashing in bright red letters on their computer screen.",-1,0
"I've been to AMH about 3 times so far this year.   Pros:  -Impressive facility, large spaces and adequate sized staff -Compassionate and patient staff -Will work up estimates and options for you if $ is an issue  Cons:  -Don't really have the best equipment for complicated internal issues -Usually a wait (days) to have ultrasounds or x-rays done and not very precise   Overall, I think AMH is a great place to go if you have an after hours emergency that seems fairly simple. Too pricey to be your primary vet and too inadequate to deal with internal medicine or oncology issues.",-1,0
"SOOOO Ive been there twice needless to say they were both such different experiences ......so lets begin with the first visit, well i had overdue maintenance on my vehicle and needed a ""Ford"" dealership to work on it.Wow they were nice fast and efficient hence the 3 stars.  BUT my wife and i are currently on the prowl for a pre-owned vehicle and we were eaten alive so to speak with one of the many salesmen who talked to us....he was so rude and after 3 hours of looking at the vehicle he then proceeded to guilt trip us into trying to sign papers to buy the vehicle,and after we said enough he got an attitude and left and sent another sales man 5 min later to tell us he had something else to do with his time.",-1,0
"After reading stellar reviews on multiple sites I talked my husband into giving Nana Tee's a go.  First off I have to say the customer service in this place is excellent. They truly want you to enjoy your experience.  We started off with chips and salsa. A small medium salsa and a small hot. The salsa is extremely fresh with lots of cilantro. We ended up combining the 2 and it was the perfect spice level for us. The only draw back is the chips. They are the average Costco pre packed type. If they made in house chips that in itself would make me go back.  My husband ordered a classic brat with a side of potato bites (tater tots), son ordered a hot dog, ketchup only. I ordered a Philly baked potato, or I should say I wanted a Philly potato..out of potatoes. So I ordered loaded potato bites, I'm not much of a hot dog fan!  Food came out hot and quick.  Husbands brat looked really good, he said it was just and average brat, nothing special. Son said same of the hot dog. My tots (about 12 of them) looked really good smothered in all of that liquid gold cheese and bacon, but they weren't crispy. They were like I make at home when I am too lazy to fry them and I pop in the oven instead.  Overall Nana Tee's was a pleasant local business experience. I want to go back to try the homemade tamales and finally get that baked potato and get some salsa to go!",-1,0
"I have to start this review with a caveat:  I am not a hotdog fan.  Most of my family is, however, so we gave this restaurant a shot.  I wanted to love this place - local business owners making a go at a very complicated hotdog menu - and there are things to love, but they may be trying to do too much at the same time.  Overall our food was decent and the people working there were so very nice and trying so hard to accommodate us, but it probably wasn't good enough to prompt this non-hotdog-lover to try again.  If you like hotdogs and want to try a wide variety of unique variations, give this place a shot.",-1,0
"I thought the tater tots were the best I have ever had. The hot dogs were very good and the service was great. I give my rating based on how likely I would go back and if I would make the 30 min drive again; the answer would be ""no"". Though all those things were good, the atmosphere was poor and the cleanliness was mediocre. There was no hiding that the previous business was a Quiznos and there was no effort to make it their own. The sings were just pulled off and the tape residue was still present... The bathrooms were disgusting and my theory has always been; if they are comfortable with the bathrooms being dirty they are comfortable with other things being dirty.",-1,0
"Owners are great and very friendly. Food is good although I did order the tamales and upgraded to a double however was not impressed with amount you get for what you pay. It seemed as if I ordered a child's plate. All in all, I will go back but just try something different. The prices are still scottsdale prices even though they moved to phoenix.",-1,0
"While this place is busy, I can only assume it's because they are the only coffee house in the area.   The coffee is overly roasted and tastes like it has sat to long.   The steamed drinks taste like desert clay... Meaning the are dry and really â¬$&@ing hot. Like you can't even drink it for 45min without risking burning you lips off. Do they know how to steam milk there?   I have worked in 4 different coffee houses before, and officially done some barista competitions, including judging, and Espresso Royal is really far from coffee royalty. It's a place you go when you have not other options.   HOWEVER! All the staff has been friendly to me that 4 times I have gone. And the atmosphere is decent.   You could do worse... Like McDonalds, but over all, this is a 3 start joint.",-1,0
"Service: good + friendly  Food: meh. Ordered the 5 street tacos: one chicken, one pork and 3 carne asana. Like others stated it was lacking in the flavor department. The chicken was beyond spicy though so I couldn't even get a feel for the actual flavor because I had to hurry up and take a swig of some tea. Chips also tasted old... Salsa was very watery. Would have been nice to have some fresh hot chips and some chunkier salsa. The carne asada had a lot of gristle which was pretty disappointing.  Ambience: It's like I went to an older Mexican food place in Mexico. The place is a little disheveled.   Probably won't be back but I hope the owners read the reviews and maybe switch up where they get their meat at, focus on the flavor (marinate longer/get a new recipe), get some hot chips in there and do a little updating and clean up with the decor.",-1,0
"The salsa didn't have very much flavor and was watery. The ""super"" nachos were ""super"" cheeseless. The nachos came out soggy and the chicken had a sweet flavor. Definitely would not recommend the nachos. However, the chimichanga and the street tacos were very good and the staff was very friendly!",-1,0
"I think I'll take the ""write as I go"" approach because I really have to talk about this salsa and I may not write anything later. So here we are- lets start with the atmosphere (just kidding I don't care about atmosphere so I'll just move it along and you can get your atmosphere business from someone else). The service is precious and they're so kind and welcoming- bless their hearts. Where was I? THE SALSA! Right so, what fresh hell did you just give me Guacamole Fresh Mexican Grill!? Picture this: weird brine tomato water with a couple pieces of salsa type ingredients. It comes with the table so it's not an end-all for me but c'mon! SALSA? Whatever-   I see the food   ITS COMING. Standby.............................   Yea okay holy smokes. The Cochinita Pibil is outrageously delicious if you dig savory slow cooked pork. Also, the cucumber agua fresca with chia seeds? Yes please Super quenchy and refreshing.  Advice: ask tons of questions like ""is it spicy?"", ""is it sweet?"", ""is it a cold?"", ""I hear your salsa blows, why?"", Etc. Don't assume you understand something at face value. This is definitely the kind of place where you might be disappointed if you go in loaded with expectations because you ate something similar somewhere else. That's just bad etiquette in the culinary world. Give it a try and talk about it y'all! They seem to really care about guest impressions so perhaps, together, we can resolve this salsa nonsense. Remember kids, table salsa is important. Ta ta!",-1,0

"Stopped in for lunch. Place was pretty dead. Waiter was quick to seat me and processed my order: carne asada chimichanga, horchata and got some house chips and salsa.  Chips were dripping with oil. Tasty but just too greasy.  Chimi arrived quickly and looked great. The taste was another story. Bland. Nothing special and just average.   This is NOT authentic Mexican. Sorry to all the gringos out there who think otherwise. I would choose 10 other nearby, hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints over this one any day.  Peace out.   And to Yelper Taric or is it Tarique? ...Chimichanga is a deep-fried burrito that is popular in the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora.",-1,0
"A decent place for Mexican food. The atmosphere and service were not particularly great. The whole place looks a bit cheap like they didn't want to spend any money on the tables, counters, menus, etc. the food, though, was pretty good. The carne asada plate and chimichanga we're both large and tasty. They provide chips with a little guacamole. Not bad overall.",-1,0
"Very impressive butcher shop.  Choice cuts of meat, excellent selection of marinated product and a good selection of different panchan.  Bought some stuffed cucumber kimchi (oyi sobaegi).  Spotless and a good variety of beef and pork.  What impressed me was that they wrapped the container of kimchi in plastic wrap after I took it to the checkout to pay.  Shall be back.",-1,0
"Location is in an area that's a bit run down, but food and service were great. There was a bit of confusion over my order (my fault, not theirs) and they happily swapped out what I'd gotten for what I wanted even though my new choice was more than twice the price.  Also, they have a groovy order kiosk where you can order in an online fashion if the counter lines are long.",-1,0
Came here at midnight on a Monday. Wanted to grab some food before catching my flight back home. This place looks extremely sketchy on the outside. It is a far distance from the strip and looks like illegal transactions happen in the vicinity all the time. The inside was decent. I ordered the BBQ burger with two tacos. Everything was made fresh to order. It took a while to get my order but everything was hot when I received it.,-1,0
"We tried Yoforia recently on a Sunday afternoon.  So, what we had was good.  But, they were out of several flavors and there were multiple empty machines.  So the selection was really limited; not bad, but certainly more limited than it should have been.  They were even out of Chocolate (See the other review from 3/8).  There were several toppings to choose from (none labeled), but TCBY (at Blakeney) has them beat with variety.  One of the very friendly staff members was very apologetic and actually revealed the reason for their condition.  The morning staff hadn't made backup batches (like they are supposed to I gather) AND she said that the equipment keeps breaking down. So, it's not that I wouldn't go here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  Given the option, I go over to Blakeney to TCBY.",-1,0
"This location is new to me, but it looks like Julia cleared it up - I vaguely remember a Coldstone here, but more power to Yoforia for taking over.

Most likely everyone was staying home, but seeing how it has been ridiculously hot for the past couple of days, I would figure this place to be hoppin'.  Two girls were manning the station... didn't really welcome us (but instead were on their smart phones).  I don't mind it so much, but when it came down to check out.... the girl made me wait about a minute before she looked up from her phone and didn't really say anything but, ""Is that it?""  I almost feel like the payment process should be self served as well...  The place seemed fairly clean... I'm always impressed by their unique looking table and chairs (the spaceship/futuristic feel).  Toppings were well stocked and was what I expected from a Yoforia.",-1,0
"I do really love me some Yoforia, but this location can be a let down.  I tend to go in with my 4 y/o nephew and he always wants the same thing, chocolate.  But a few times they were out of it, along with half of the flavors.  Really??  Out of chocolate one of the most common flavors??  Odd.  I like the original, which they do always have, but the fruit options can be really lacking, or not look appealing.  Nothing worse then biting into a sour tasting strawberry.  I can't really comment on the service, there is never anyone up front when we walk in, and sometimes it can be 5 minutes till someone shows up so we can pay.  So for this reason I appreciate it being self serve.  The quicker I can get in/out and my nephew can dig in to his treat the better!",-1,0
"Fortunately, I've been a relatively healthy person. In fact, when I attempted to go to my most recent appointment with Dr. Battersby, I had no idea the office had relocated... like, a year an a half ago! I pulled out my cell phone as my car ran in front of the boarded up, obviously vacant, building and got directions just down the street to the new location. (7550 N 19th Ave., Suite 103)  Dr. Battersby's office staff isn't gonna jump up and down to greet you; they are not going to trip over themselves and play their little violins in sympathy for sick old you, but they will do their best to get you in THAT day, if needed. And, let's face it, that's what you want. You want to see the doctor, right?",-1,0
"Now, I used to experience incredible claustrophia in this store but i popped by recently when I was in the Eaton centre and it seems to have undergone a bit of a redesign.  It was a lot tidier and less cramped.  It has a huge selction of barbies, leap frog products, Dora, a craft and games section, and a stock of baby toys.  Most of the stuff is good but definitely overpriced.  Even the sale stuff. Also, there is this random section of Canda souvenirs at the front of the store.  Not sure exactly what they are going for here.....Anyways, it is good in a pinch...if you are looking for regular toys downtown.",-1,0
"I guess what some people want from grocery stories is different from what I want. This store lacks a lot in what I want.  It does have almost everything you could want. If there's a random item on your recipe that you've never heard of before, Woodman's probably has it. They've also got good prices on lots of things, especially name-brand dry goods and dairy products.  I also like that I can get a variety of pet supplies there -- they have more variety than most grocery or general retail stores.   However, the layout drives me absolutely bonkers. It's difficult to navigate the store, and the isles in the meat department are tiny. It also looks fairly unclean, and because it's extremely crowded, it's hard for someone who's never been to the store to get oriented, even at times of the day that should be slow.   The staff is decently friendly and efficient, and I've never had any service-related problems. The appearance and the difficulty of getting around are what make it less than ideal for me.",-1,0
I can find pretty much anything I could possibly want here and cheaper than hyvee. A good example is a large bag of California walnuts is $12.99 in the baking aisle at hyvee and $8.99 at woodmans--exact same brand and everything.  This makes me happy because I'm awful at cutting coupons and I still know I'm saving $$$ if I go to woodmans.  They have a lot of great local and Wisc. Produced food products. They carry items from my favorite MKE bakery and also my favorite local pickles.,-1,0
"The prices are usually pretty great, but you really need to pick your time of day for shopping. I've tried going on Sunday afternoon before, and never again. It's a zoo! So I tried going on a Tuesday late night (like, 1am) and the crowds were much less, but there were only 2 cashiers and they didn't speak English very well. I have yet to find the perfect time, but for the overall value and selection, they can't be beat!",-1,0
Amazing juices but the day I went I was served but a guy who was on his phone and amazingly continued his phone call while serving me. Even when I stopped ordering and asked him if he needed time to finish his call. He looked at me empty headed and continued his call. Booster Juice needs to work on its customer service but again their juices are amazing and I will be back.,-1,0
I had a late lunch at BQM King West ... they opened in September.  I've been to BQM Ossington a couple times and had a good meal so I thought I'd try this location today.  I ordered a Riverside burger (with no lettuce) and no fries or salad ... just the burger as I knew it would be enough.  It was a good burger.  The patty had lots of flavour and the bun was soft.  It was really fun and messy.  I'll get it again.  Mike took excellent care of me and was super friendly.  They plan on having a small patio in front in the summer.  No doubt it will be great place to sip some local craft beer when the weather gets warm!,-1,0
"the quality of sushi here is about the same as Kabuki in Tempe Marketplace, so if we are comparing prices I'd rather go to Kabuki. I tried the Marilyn Monroe roll (made with pink soy paper) and it was good, but nothing particularly memorable. the most memorable dish I tried there was the tempura mushroom appetizer. this is the kind of place I'd go to again if I was in the area and hungry, but not good enough that I'd ever specifically make a plan to eat dinner here.  also, they play that club/techno/trance music all night. at least they don't play it ridiculously loud like at RA.",-1,0
"Pretty dissapointing...  I was a big fan of the original location, but didn't get out there that often, just because it's so far north. When they opened this location, I was elated...until I ate there.  I don't know if this place is signicantly worse than the DC Ranch location (but I think it is) or if the original's not as good as I remember, but either way, this restaurant was a lot more style than substance.   I do like their creative ""signature sushi"" items, which are also featured at the original location and include unconventional ingredients like steak, chicken, apples, caesar dressing and balsamic vinegarette. Although the quality is below-stellar, most of these selections are tasty and fun.  DO NOT, however, order the ""Bayou Self Roll"" with spicy crawfish, andouille sausage, green onions wrapped in orange soy paper w/ a remonade sauce. It tastes like cold feet. It was so bad that we sent it back, only to have the waiter tell us ""oh, that surprises me, this is my favorite roll!"" I don't want to call him a lier, but I will say that he's completely full of ****. No way that can be true.",-1,0
"I actually visited the original location in DC Ranch. I stopped here with some friends for a late night snack and drinks. This was my first time here so one of the guys ordered a couple of Tootsie Rolls for the 4 of us (well 3 of us since my boyfriend doesn't like sushi) and a Berry White martini (It's blue) and it was fantastic. Don't remember what was in the Toostie Roll, sorry, but I love sushi so I usually just inhale it, but it was good too. There's a cool sleek vibe to this place.",-1,0
"Super friendly service in a nice contemporary spot.   A+ for the large selection of happy hour, 1/2 price items off of the main menu  (Tue - Sat)...pencils with no erasers are provided to mark your order right on the menu.    Can't get over the indigo blue wasabi?  Ask for the green stuff so your sushi doesn't look like bait that's been dyed bright blue for the night fishing.  Signature rolls have the most clever names 'Get Clucked' - Tempura Chicken, asparagus, cucumber w/ avacado 'Eating Nemo' - Krab (fake crab), salmon, lemon & ponzu 'Me Soy Horny' - Shrimp Temp,spicy tuna, cucumber/ avacado and soy paper 'Kiss my Bass'.....you get the idea  Must order the Spicy Rockin Shrimp Tempura served in a large martini glass.  Blue Sundays = 50% off alcohol if you wear blue and if you forget, take a little blue wasabi, mix with Kirin beer, dip finger and wipe across white shirt - enjoy your blue martini.  I would go back....more than one location (Gilbert, AZ)",-1,0
"One Liner: The wasabi is BLUE   Food: (scale of 0-4) 2.5 Yes, the wasabi is really blue in blue wasabi. This is a nice little place for happy hour and dinner. The appetizers are very nice, the rolls are decent. Last I checked, that's what a sushi bar is for!  This is also a very nice place for people watching.  Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.5  Service 0.1:   Decor 0.1:   Speed 0.1:   Dessert 0.1:   Prices 0.1:   My score for this experience is 3 stars. Other than the blue wasabi, there is nothing special about it. However, the food was very consistently good. That makes it a great place for happy hours.",-1,0
"Upon walking into Blue Wasabi, you kinda get the feeling that you have left the desert and are now in the city...  It's dimly lit, with tones of blue that surround the bar area.     We started the night out with some drinks, my friends had beers and I was anxious to try the martini menu.  After checking a great list of martini's, I went for a regular cosmo, it was good, but 1 was enough for the night.  We ordered a variety of rolls- btw, all the rolls have random names.  I wish I could tell you a few of the names, but I was too busy having my cosmo.  All the sushi was good, not to big, but the perfect size for a bite.  Oh yeah, they do give you blue wasabi and it kinda weirded me out, so I had very little...but they stayed true to their name.  This is a good place, next time I'm in town, I'll be back.",-1,0
"Well, yes, you actually get blue wasabi.   My poorly written overview: I went there around four or so in the Pm.  Walking in of course its a cool look when you walk in however, we felt zero vibe or personality. It was almost uncomfortable to be in . Not too cool as I was talking my Boyfriend there for the first time.   My Motor Mouth Munchies: OK , The best part is!!! - My boyfriend and many many other people , DO NOT EAT CARBS, so any asian /sushi places he usually gets the sashimi , however an amazing discovery , that very very few places have is sashimi/sushi rolls made with cucumber instead of rice!! Perfect! such a great alternative to carbs! and they were delish! and they have hard to find sake called ""SaketoMe"" sparkling asian pear sake, yum.  My Obscure price thoughts:- We happened to be there during happy hour( although it felt like drab hour) so price was good. cant really complain.  My overly picky service agenda- The service took just a bit too long. Not really bad but not great. I couldnt even tell you if it was a guy or a girl. But hey better than remembering a crappy guy or horrible boy.  IN all , strictly based on the cucumber no carbs rolls well be back.",-1,0
"Good location, pleasant waiters, hip decour.  I can just imagine the owners meeting and planning the restaurant's theme... ""let's start another sushi bar and promote it as the  new ""In Sushi Place"" to hang and be seen in Scottsdale"".  You didn't notice great fresh sushi at fantastic prices in the above did you?  Now don't get me wrong.  I gave it three stars because I found it an OK place to eat, drink and kick back.  Sushi is just not their top priority.  I also get a little freaked out dipping my stuff in blue wasabi.  It looks like they mixed it with anti-freeze.",-1,0
"The Beautiful Carin and I met some friends at Blue Wasabi last evening. I have mixed feelings about little Blue. On the one hand, they have some of the best prices (and great Happy Hour pricing:) in Scottsdale, for both their sushi, negri and sashimi offerings and for their small plates. They make tasty and unusual dishes,(good sliders, pork egg rolls, shrimp, etc.:) They pour a nice cocktail and during Happy Hour they sell a good sized marti for under $5:) The decor and atmosphere are both upscale and comfortable:) On the other hand, the sushi is not the best I ever had...it doesn't seem as fresh as some of the other places around town and the presentation seems to be a bit of an afterthought. Oh, and the wasabi is blue....really, really, really blue!  Not a ""pretty"" blue...sky blue or robins egg blue...it looks like someone mixed a bottle of india ink with play-doh and scooped a little on the plate...not an attractive a dining element on my plate. They need to think the food color in the wasabi through a little bit...I don't mind that it's not green, but this blue just isn't right:) But, they do get a crowd...we had cocktails and a little dinner with our friends and the place was 3/4's full from the time we arrived until we left nearly 2 hours later, so maybe I'm in the minority on the blue coloring of the wasabi:) Our service was very good...they were busy, but our glasses were always full and the dishes came out in a timely fashion:) I like Blue Wasabi for the small plates and the Happy Hour pricing and I certainly do eat their sushi.  So, the service is good and the atmosphere is pleasant and relaxing. The people watching is top quality! I just wish they would change out the food coloring for the Wasabi:)",-1,0
"I""m not a strip mall person, I dunno, I'm just not.  Being in a strip mall takes away from this place a little but hey they have a great sushi happy hour.  The drinks offered were a little too sugary for me, so I stuck with wine.  The sushi rolls are half off during HH and I found all of it to be very fresh and delicious. It's not high end or anything extraordinary, but for the price you get bang for your buck. It wasn't overly crowded and our waitress was very polite and friendly.",-1,0
This was probably my 5th time at a Blue Wasabi and I still find it 'eh.  I tend to veer towards the more traditional sushi places and think that chicken and random fruits do not belong in or on sushi.  I would agree that they try some cutting edge stuff when it comes to sushi and while it tastes ok; it is just weird.  If you are sick of the same ole' same ole' sushi and want to try something unique; Blue Wasabi is your place.  I do however like that they have low carb rolls made with cucumber instead of rice but I find them ok at best.  They are also too difficult to eat because they fall apart easily and are slippery.  Its a nice thought and very innovative but low carb doesn't really work with sushi.  I think that you NEED the rice to make it work.  I dunno...use some brown rice or something instead of white....  Their specialty mixed drink list is equally as unique.  They have a big selection of martinis that all look pretty good.  I tried the one with jello in it and it was very tasty.  I mean how could anything that sweet with jello in it NOT be good?  A bit to sweet for me but I had to try it because of a review I read on here.  My party of 4 went on a Friday night at about 8ish.  It was relatively busy but we got a table right away.  Our waitress was fast and friendly.  All-in-all it was a decent visit and I will be back every blue moon.,-1,0
"Although it's been a while since visiting the establishment, a recent conversation about sushi spots in the Scottsdale area brought me back to my wonderful visit to Blue Wasabi.  The sushi itself is good but it's the colorful and creative drinks that truly stand out in my mind.  Be sure to visit during happy hour for a great deal and don't leave without trying the appletini, it's my favvvv !!! :) :)",-1,0
This place used to be very good but the last couple times we visited the food was only okay.   The staff is usually great but they need to update the decor.,-1,0
"Definitely an interesting store with very diverse merchandise ranging from home decor such as furniture and rugs to wine to random kitchen gadgets. I like the fact that a lot of this is made from around the world, so you can definitely find something unique. I will say I prefer shops where I know it is a fair trade store (I tried looking online to see if they were and I couldn't find that info so if I'm wrong, I'm sorry!). It was definitely a place I would go back to get a funky gift or to look for something different for house decor. But other than that, it was just ok.",-1,0
"Cost Plus, I love your stuff. I love that I can walk in and find all sorts of treats and gifts, even for people I don't know very well, and wouldn't know what to get them otherwise. Your painted gift bags? Absolutely gorgeous. Your selection of foreign snacks? Amazing!  But I only go 2-3 times a year, so for heaven's sake, if I don't want to sign up for your rewards program, don't pester me to sign up, don't rationalize that it'll only take ""two seconds,"" don't pout at my total and try to guilt trip me for the entire time I'm cashing out because I DON'T WANT TO SIGN UP. How many times and how many ways do I have to say ""no thank you"" per transaction?",-1,0
"I usually order items from Cost Plus online when they have sales but I decided to visit this location so I could look at the cast iron tea set and Moroccan glasses in person before purchasing. I am obsessed with mostly their kitchen items, though they also have international foods, furniture, candles, frames, jewelry, etc. Some items seem over priced and my friend recently purchased a chair for around $150 that broke as soon as she tried to sit on it. I'm still tempted to one day try their furniture, but for now I will purchase their amazing cups and tea wares.   The employees I have encountered have always been polite. The man who checked us out when I bought my cast iron tea pots was nice enough to ask if I knew how to care for them. I did, but I appreciated the fact that he was so helpful. I felt like he cared which makes me definitely plan on returning.",-1,0
"This is my hometown coffee shop if I'm able I stop by here for my coffee on the weekend.  It's a  tiny little joint located on Allegheny River Blvd.  It has a few 2 and 4 top tables and some nice large chairs with plenty of magazines and newspapers laying about.  The staff is always friendly and genuinely interested in making you happy.  I can't claim to be a gourmet with respect to coffee, but I have always found my medium coffee, hot, dark and tasty with fresh cream and accompianments at the plenty.  They also have a selection of pastry and sandwiches, but the reason that inspired me to write this review was this past Sunday I stopped in for some coffee found myself with some time to kill and decided to have brunch.  I didn't even know they had the capability to cook anything on site, but I was wrong.  I ordered a western omelette which was a delicious two egg omelett served with very high quality ingredients (ham, red onion, red pepper, spinach, etc...) cooked light and perfectly with the eggs being fluffy and airy.  I asked for bacon for the side, but they were out.  However, the guy offered to ""run next door"" and buy some for me.  I settled on the sausage which was okay, not homemade or anything memorable.  There are not many other options in Oakmont for coffee or sunday brunch, so you could do a lot worse than this place for a nice light breakfast.",-1,0
"Manuel's used to be awesome.  Definitely would have been a four star Mexican restaurant.  However, something changed.  Ownership, menu, service.  It's bordering Garcia's territory, except the albondigas and the ribeye steak with norteno sauce are still pretty good.",-1,0
"Pleasantly surprised.  After some bad experiences at a North Phoenix Manuel's, I hadn't tried another one in years.  But today it was close and well... I'm glad I went.    I was able to get a table at 1pm - and there was only other one couple in eye shot. Part of that is because there are lots of little alcoves for eating, and part of it is because they serve the food so quickly that if you got there at noon you're out the door by 1pm easily.  I'm willing to give it that excuse because both the service and the food were quite good.  Their rice and beans aren't anything to write home about, but they weren't so bad that it took away from the meal.    My only negative, and this could be why there were fewer folks, is that not only do they have a pretty limited lunch menu, with much smaller portions, but they aren't really ""lunch special"" prices.  Their lunch menu ran from $7-10 with most things $8-9.  Considering the full sized meals with more options were available for just $1-$2 more, why not get the larger size and a doggie bag for dinner?    Not a bad spot, but didn't exactly rock my world either.  Ideally - 3 1/2 stars.",-1,0
"I happened to visit Manuel's yesterday for some lunch with some friends. I had never gone before, but thought I would give it a try.  Here's a very quick assessment of the place:  atmosphere: very 70s/80s - clearly the place has been here a while. service: fair. nothing stellar, but not terrible either. food: also fair, not great but not bad. price: perhaps a bit overpriced for the quality, but not by much. overall experience: ok.",-1,0

"Mikado Japanese Restaurant is nice and homey....   Stepping inside takes me back in time and across the oceans, feels like I am in a small restaurant in a small Japanese village 30 years + ago... Hey it is not a bad thing.. as it does have its traditional charm.   Even the waitress and the sushi chefs and the kitchen help all dressed in the more traditional clothings.. they wear it like everyday clothes not like a costumes in some other restaurants.   Lunch Specials from $9.99 Bento Box which comes in a separate sheet and the usual Lunch menu.   Fuji Lunch with Ice cream ($14.99)  - You have a choice of Egg Drop Soup or Miso Soup.. My Miso Soup was A-OK  - Salad with ginger dressing.. so so... why most of the places I been to have to drown their fresh green in dressing that makes me really not understand, so I will request, dressing on the side from now on  - 9 pcs Sushi - 3 cucumber rolls/3 tuna roll/Salmon/Tuna/Shrimp nirgri A-OK.. the seaweed is crispy and have a great flavour. The fish are good and fresh.. the Shari rice is standard.. I found it a little hard did not Wow me  - Shrimp and Veggie Tempura the choice of veggie is really good: green bean, cauliflower, yam, broccoli, eggplant and pepper.. love the veggie. The Shrimp is really fresh, moist..and tender.. but the batter is a little heavy to my liking  - ice cream you have a choose for green tea, vanilla and black seasame.. hmmm black seasame always my fave! Great to have that as one of the selections!   Portion is a little small.. I feel like I just started eating after having that.. maybe I have to order more!! :)   Services here is nice and friendly.. Japanese lady is so high energy, talking in her high pitch voice..like a happy little girl! :P   BTW there are no cellphone signs everywhere on the wall, on the hot water heater.. everywhere I look.   I would definitely recommend Mikado if you have craving for a authentic and traditional Japanese experience.. here you will get excellent Japanese services and food and even sitting at the tatami room at the back.  3.5 star",-1,0

I am not sure why there are so many great reviews.   We ate there ordering two sandwiches; a Rueben and a Pastrami on Rye.   The ingredients were fine and they were hot when they brought them out.   The problem is the bread was soaked in greasy butter. Literally dripping from the bread.   Not toasty as it should have been but soaking in grease.   Mediocre at best.,-1,0
"I saw this place and instantly thought a northern style deli. Looking at the menu, I noticed that all the ""condiments"" were extra: Cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles, tomato... all extra. So my $6 sandwich ends up being $2 extra when your done with topping it. Ive never heard of a deli place charging you for standard items on a sandwich. My sandwich, plus a side of mac salad and drink was $12. KInda steep. Food was good though, no issues there, and they were doing a good brisk business when I was there. The breakfast items seem priced better, so I may try that.",-1,0

There are old school video games in the back, the bathrooms sometimes over flow all the way into the bar area, and it can be crowded. There's usually cover on weekend nights after 10 and a line, I think about $5. Honestly, it's a typical college bar.",-1,0

To pork taco was really good though, it was really tender and wasn't over seasoned. I didn't really care for the rice, the beans tasted like they came out of a can... but good canned beans at least. I had the red roasted chile and chips too. The chips were great, really thin and crispy. The chile needed a little salt and was fine. I will go back but just for the pork i think, if i just had pork tacos i would have given them 4 stars.",-1,0
"I'm big on supporting local business owners to the fullest, but I'm also honest with my reviews.    Jester's location is tough as is since the storefront is facing an airport and next door is a motorcycle shop and a MVD registration.  However, the good side is that it's the only Mexican restaurant within a 1 to 2 miles radius!  Most other places around the area are sandwich and burger shops.  The shop itself is very new -- matter of fact; think I was their first Yelper.  The decor to me is kind of cheesy with a Jester mascot in a jeep baja and the walls were splashed with some comical quotes of the day.  Needless, to say I wasn't here for that.  I ordered the 2 taco combo; my buddies ordered the cheese quesadilla and a beef burrito.  Fresh ingredients and made to your order, that's a plus in my opinion. However, my corn tortilla tacos were okay.  I thought overall it was pretty plain.  I had a beef and pork taco and there were no seasoning or spice except topped with your choice of sides.  I just had the pico de gallo, lettuce, and hot sauce.  Truthfully, the sauce was mild at best.  Nothing really popped on my plate.  My buddies thought their dishes were excellent.  I was told the burrito was real tasty and the cheese quesadilla was awesome!  Needless, to say I'm the one telling the story - wink!    Service is real relaxed and inviting.  I think the owners of the place worked hard to get this place up and running.  Their welcoming and position attitude is much appreciated! - Enjoy!",-1,0
"I was really looking forward to eating here due to the recommendation of a coworker who knows what's up. Unfortunately I'm going to have to give it a 3 star ""meh""...for now.   The place is like a mom-n-pop Chipotle; you choose your meat and they build a taco/burrito etc. to your liking with their fixings. I had a carne asada burrito, it was tasty but it was cold. I've experienced this same problem at Chipotle and I assume it's due to the misuse of their steam tables. The chips and salsa that are included with each order were very good, and so are the prices and their service. The place is new, so I'll have to give this place another go and see if they've got some of the kinks worked out.",-1,0
"This place is average at best. Very friendly atmosphere and very friendly staff make up for the lack of imagination when it comes to the food.

"Unbelievable find at the Las Vegas-NORTH food court. I always get my Subway, but decided to go a different route that day. To my surprise, this Las Vegas Great Steak & Potato was pretty good and super bang for the buck. I never really seen a Great Steak & Potato serve such a big sandwich. So, a LARGE great steak sandwich is $10, but it is like more than a foot long. So if you are resting your foot from a marathon day of shopping at the Las Vegas-NORTH outlet, you can re-energize with a LARGE great steak sandwich and order of fries. If you need more flavoring, you can sprinkle their extra seasoning.",-1,0
"Considering the amount of money they spent on the ride, I was not as thrilled as I thought I would be however it is a good time and a must see for tourists.  The view to the north and north west is great, unobstructed, but with almost nothing to see.  The view to the west, sw, s, and se is partially obstructed by casinos and hotels leaving you with only a partial view.  A few feet higher would have made a big difference.  At the peak, you can see the bellagio fountain show which is really the highlight.  At night, the lights really make a difference and it is a much better experience.  The video is annoying and if the writer and the comedian/host ever gets another job I would be surprised.  There is almost nothing informative about the video nor is it remotely entertaining.  Even the quiz questions are too simple and at least one is a blatant plug for the Yardhouse.  The pricing is not bad, $19.99 during the day and $39.99 at night with $5.00 discounts to locals.  This summer locals were 1/2 off on Tuesdays, not sure if it is still going.  Helpful tip 1-if you prebook a time, book the daytime price but book your time at 6:45.  The daytime price for prebookings goes until 7 but if you show up after 6 without pre-booking you pay the full price.  Helpful tip 2 - the groupon and living social deals are deceiving.  They claim $20.00 for day or night but when you go to pay, the price jumps up to $34.99 for nighttime which is the same price you pay if you are local.  Helpful tip 3 - kids under 12 are free.  As is the norm in Vegas, you will have your photo taken and then they will try to gouge you if you buy the photo.  Those prices are way out of line.  Something I never understood, why charge a price most people won't pay when instead you can charge something more reasonable and make more money overall. (For those who can't do simple mathematics and economics if you charge 30 dollars and sell 100 you make $3000.  If you charge 20 dollars and sell 200 you make $4000.    Anyway, If you are visiting, definitely do it.  If you are local, take advantage of the deals when you have friends in town.  I would say it makes for a romantic date but that is only if you manage to get a car to yourself.  When there are 20+ others, including people drunk and getting sick, it isn't very romantic.",-1,0
"I have been on the High Roller twice now.  Once with a friend at night and once during the day with my husband.    Got lucky both times, they were not crowded.  Going at night is a treat.   Seeing the lights of Vegas is always beautiful against the black backdrop of the desert.  The only bad thing is that the observation wheel is behind a lot of the casinos, so you can't see all the way down the strip.  I also enjoyed seeing the view during the day. Las Vegas is in a valley and on a clear day you can see the beautiful red rock formations around the city.  We were also fortunate to catch the sunset.  The ride takes about 30 minutes, but that is long enough.  They have a pod with an open bar that you can pay extra for, but you only have thirty minutes to slam them drinks down!  Personally, I am more interested in the view.  The wheel is good to do once or twice, but not habit forming.  I think it is a little pricey, but everything in Las Vegas has gone up.  It is $39 for adults at night and $29 for the day without the bar.  They did have a summer special for locals - Two for One Tuesdays.  Check to see if they are still offering this great savings before you go.  Have fun!",-1,0
"Our friends wanted to try this, and even though I'm terrified of heights I said ok. We paid the extra for the open bar. We got lucky and it was only our party of four and only one other couple. I could see if it was a large group obviously you would have less opportunity to receive drinks and if your short like me less of a view. I think each pod holds 40 people, but I think that would be a tight fit.   Our bartender was awesome. She was from Rhode Island. Sadly I have forgotten her name...uh we had already been drinking for quite some time before we got on the ride lol. Anyways she was very fast, personable with just the right amount of sass. She made sure everyone got drinks and made us some delicious shots. We enjoyed her company and her skills as a bartender.   The view was pretty, but we had a great room on the 54th floor and I would say our view was just as good from there. It was worth doing once, but probably not something I would do again. The ride is a total of thirty minutes long. Drink fast to get your money's worth, if your lucky like us with a small party and a great bartender not too hard. A larger party....good luck.",-1,0
"I had high expectations. Next to none we're met. I was expecting a great view but instead all I saw was parking lots and hotels. I thought I was going to see. The cool streets but no. It went higher then I expected,  which was good. I would not go on it again.",-1,0
"A pricey gimmick, but truly an amazing view. Thankfully I went midweek and it was pretty empty; not sure it would have been as much fun after a long wait pressed in by dozens more people. My biggest criticism is the constant self-promotion and relentless reminders of HOW COOL it was!! It's a Ferris Wheel, guys. I'm not going to buy your overpriced drinks and I don't need the guy on the video screen to keep telling me how awesome it is. But still, that view!",-1,0
"The High Roller doesn't appear to be bigger than the London Eye, and the capsule actually seems to be slightly smaller.  I had a better experience than most (from what I've read in other Yelp reviews), since my family and I rode by ourselves as part of a birthday celebration & surprise gift for my sister-in-law (her Navy husband came just for the week to surprise her & reunited with the family at the High Roller).  Our ride was at 6PM-ish, so I absolutely have to tell people, the view will most likely be more spectacular if you ride during the night.  The tickets aren't cheap, so make sure that you  ride under optimal conditions for your money!",-1,0
"It is receiving a three start only because of bad timing. I recently went to Las Vegas and took my Mom for Mother's Day. For Mother's Day I bought her a night time 30 minute helicopter ride of the strip. it was wonderful and because I was spending over $100 I got the Highest Roller passes for free as part of the promotion.  We did the helicopter ride in the evening (when it was dark) and then did the Big Roller during the day so that we can see Vegas at night and during the day from up high. It was good to see both. Therefore, if you can I would recommend the helicopter ride better but I realize not everyone can so in that case I highly recommend the High Roller :)",-1,0
"Price with $5 off discount coupon given to me from the Flamingo hotel was $24.99, which the staff applied to my entire group, although it said one per customer, she didn't care! :) And we got there right as the prices changed from the Day admission to Night and she still gave us the day admission fare.  The views are amazing, even for someone like me who has a fear of heights.  The total time we were on the ride was about 33 mins.  My group had gotten a drink from the bar before heading up.  They do offer a HH deal that has a bartender in the Pod, but for the price and the time spent on the ride, I don't think it's a good deal, unless you are slamming the drinks down or just taking shots.  Those who haven't been on it, try it and then you can say you've done it.",-1,0
"We had a nice view on a beautiful, clear night on the High Roller.    Problems: 1) Drunk guy in our pod hogging the front part of the window and belittling his wife  (They probably should not be pushing the alcohol prior to the 30-minute ride)  2) $2 service fee per ticket purchased at the official ticket box office (that's a first for me, I usually buy tickets directly at a venue to AVOID ticket fees)  3) $70 for two people (A bit steep)  4) Oh yeah.... super confusing figuring out how to get there by car (no GPS updates yet for the reconfiguration) and only a small sign on Las Vegas Blvd.  Accidentally turned right instead of left near the wheel and ended up in the Quad lot instead of the Linq lot)  Next time, I will wait to go around closing and hope for a pod that is more empty.  P.S.  You can use Quick Rewards/comps if you have them on your Total Rewards card to pay for the High Roller.",-1,0
"Solid 3.5 stars only if you got the good Groupon deal, 2 tickets for $65 plus 2 free drinks if you were as savvy as us to get the free passes from the Quad security as we were asking directions to this 'ferris wheel' lol.  but being dehyrdated for most of the day, we asked for bottled water instead of beer or magaritas, probably a waste, but a bonus that it was Fiji water, hey it's Vegas...and I digress...  Initially not a big thing for me to do since it's such a touristy thing, and seen all the lights at night as they don't really change, but it's a thing to do, and for a 30-minute excursion, it's not going to take a big chunk of my day.  Impressed by how the staff worker just let 6 ppl per booth, to give lots of space and some privacy, even at 11pm at night.  Still quite steady amount of tourists still lining up.  542 feet is the peak, just fyi.",-1,0
"This attraction didn't really live up to the hype for me. I thought it moved a little too slow and the views weren't anything spectacular. Granted, I'm a local and have seen the strip plenty of times.   Definitely go at night. It's $10 more but it looks a lot prettier!",-1,0
"My wife and I purchased tickets for the High Roller at the same time we booked our hotel room at Planet Hollywood. I would avoid this process at all costs. It was very cumbersome to redeem the ticket. People at high roller couldn't find our reservation and PH said that they don't store that info.   Better to just show up and pay at the box office.  After all that, we had a ball. The entrance to the HR is very elaborate. We went around 11pm on a Thursday night. There was no crowds. We got frozen drinks at the bar and were able to take them in the cabin.  The cabin was ok. The pictures definitely make it seem a lot nicer. We had 16 ppl in our cabin and it felt like it shouldn't have much more than that, since most people were standing with no place to sit.   Views were incredible. Definitely loved the nighttime views of Vegas.   I think the HR would be a lot more fun if you could reserve an entire cabin for your party.",-1,0
Nice experience. Something different. Wanted to get the happy hour $5 drink special but lots of confusion and no help from anyone on getting it. Kiosks to buy tickets didn't even give the option. Had drink bar with full priced drinks before you got to platform. One of the bartenders just so happened to be getting off a ball so we asked him. He said it was a $10 upgrade not a $5 so highly confusing. Not sure if would do it again....,-1,0
"I remember when this was first being built, everyone, including myself, was so excited about it. The High Roller is the largest Ferris wheel, or ""observation wheel"". It is located at the Linq Promenade and looks really pretty during the day and night. At night, it lights up and they even do a light show, where the lights on the wheel change according to the music. The prices vary depending on the time and Day you go for a 30 minute ride. They do have deals on Groupon or local deals if you know anyone who lives here. I have been once, and it is definitely something to check out. I probably won't go again just because there's really nothing else to do in the pod. I think it would be fun for a date night or when you have visitors. It's an attraction for all ages. They do have a bar before going on the ride, so you can drink in the pod. Sometimes they have events, and I definitely want to try the Yoga one.",-1,0
"if your looking for that perfect view above Las Vegas, the High Roller is defiantly on of the better ones. Located centrally on the strip, the high roller takes you on half hour ride 550 ft above the LV Strip. It is a bit pricy in my opinion but I had some coupons so I took advantage of the opportunity. If money is no object I would get a group of friends and rent you own cabin. I was unfortunate enough to share the ride with a bunch of screaming and crying kids! Once was enough for me on this ride but it was worth the one time trip.",-1,0
I guess you need to do it once...but at least get a groupon so you can get a good drink along with the ride.  Yes the view is cool... but you can see it from other places.  The ride is slow and smooth.  I am afraid of heights and it didn't bother me for whatever reason on this thing...even when the announcer said not to panic with the technical difficulties that has us stuck up top for a bit...,-1,0
"I got to admit I did not want to go on this attraction. My wife made me go.   Although I would never go again I'm glad I've been. Hopefully that makes sense, it does to me.  Ladies like this stuff and it's a whole lot better than sitting through ""The Notebook"" movie AGAIN.",-1,0
"If this is your first time in Vegas, or you've never had the opportunity to see the view from high up in Vegas, then this might be worth experiencing. Otherwise, it was just...fine. The Linq is a pretty cool place, all in all, and the High Roller is a nice enough experience. It takes you in a ""pod""- basically a large, glass enclosed room (pretty chilly, as the AC was blasting), and slowly circles so you can see some nice views of the city. We must have hit it at just the right time- 8p on a Friday- because there was absolutely no line. You have the opportunity to purchase overpriced beverages at a bar before entering into your pod, and you're off. The pod plays music (it is at a low volume, it isn't a party), and facts about Vegas. While the views are nice, it is a little on the boring side. I could see it maybe being more exciting if it were more crowded with wild people, though!   I can't see doing this over and over, but I'm glad I can check it off the list.",-1,0
"Brought my GF at the time here because she had never been to Vegas before.  They serve you drinks before you walk up at a bar which is nice.  The ride takes about 30 minutes to complete and the views are spectacular.  You can see everything around the strip which is awesome.  But honestly,  after a little bit it got kind of boring and we were ready to get off and get back down to the ground.  Def a good thing to go on once to see the sights but I doubt I will be repeating.",-1,0
"I bought a Groupon deal for two people for $75 for the late night ride which is from 7pm -1am and it was open bar.   I wouldn't pay full price for this, and even at $75 for two is was just okay. I left satisfied but not with my socks blown off, even with the open bar. As a matter of fact I would not recommend the open bar because how many freakin drinks can one really consume in 30 min? And you're not allowed to take shots. I had one, my boyfriend had another and we noticed we were already coming down when we decided to get one more and share it. (Its more like 25 min)  This view isn't anything spectacular. It's nothing that you haven't seen from above the 25th floor on any hotel on the strip. I think the view from The Stratosphere is probably better.   All in all, its one of those touristy new things in Vegas that you want to/have to check out. So I am glad I did, but I wouldn't do it again. I would recommend that everyone go out and try it though. The ferris wheel concept is pretty cool. Get up there, snap some pictures that you'll keep forever and let me know how you like it.",-1,0
"Check in 1st for $10 off.  A good value.    If you see kiosk girl outside you can buy ticket & #bypass line.  Same price. Worth it & they aren't out for long.  I think, having done the (k)night ride(r)..I would want the day... To see the Mars landscape.  I seriously felt I was on Mars.    Drinks are cheaper before you get in.",-1,0
We booked a pod for my daughter's wedding thru the group sales group. They were hard to work with. They ended up double billing us for the pod. In addition we had requested the option of turning off the videos so we could record the ceremony without the background noise. The request did not get processed and the video remained on. We requested a reduction in the fee for their mistake. It took 3 weeks for the reduction and we had to file complaint to credit card company to fix the double fee.  To be fair it was a great ride just noisy for a wedding ceremony. It would a great ride either as an individual fee. The group sales folks are the problem.,-1,0
Fun & neat way to see a different view of the city. Way over priced especially since there is no child's price. I am still glad we did it once but if you are on a budget you may want to reconsider. The ticket purchase booth is oddly far from the entrance & confusing with the 10 minute increments. I purchased my tickets & a friend behind me could not get the same time because that time had past. We asked before he purchased & they said it was ok & we didn't have a problem. Not sure what the purpose of the times on the ticket are. We heard the fit about 40+ people in each pod but only had about 12 in ours. That was pretty much the perfect amount & hopefully they won't ever go over 20 unless specifically requested. More than about 15 would start to restrict your ability to move around freely with out bumping into others.,-1,0
"Goodness, what's with the price?  The views are phenomenal, dialogue is helpful, but the price is terrible. Especially considering the length of time you spend on this thing. We paid $35/person for a 30 minute ride. The line moves very fast and we purchased our tickets a few minutes before riding, not too shabby. However, the price. I understand it's pricier at night due to popularity and nice views of the the strip and all of the pretty lights.   Would I pay that much again? No way! Try to scout some cheaper tickets. They put these on Groupon every now and then or buy them online for a promotion.    Views are great, price is unreasonable!",-1,0
"Personally this is not for me but I am giving it three stars because I realize I was able to ride this for Free due to the Veterans day special they were offering to give Active Duty / Veterans free Ticket for them plus a guest which is such a awesome deal.  If I had paid full price for my ticket I imagine I would of left with a worse taste in my mouth because this thing is honestly very slow and not nearly as intimate as I had imagined. The pods are roomy because they don't JAM it packed with people but it includes very little space to sit and our pod had a little toddler that ended up dumping my purse everywhere when my friend was taking our photo. The view is truly amazing and I think if you're going to pony up the $ it is worth doing the ride that is at night. If I had to ever ride this again though I would definitely go with the VIP ride that includes open bar because at least I would feel like I was doing something. I am more of a fast paced personality and I don't really ""relax"" and take in the view all that well especially with their TV monitors blaring that annoying guys voice with fun trivia facts. Overall everyone that worked that evening was super friendly and I did end up buying the photo at the end because it was a pretty good special they were running for three photos it was $35 plus the frame . Since my ticket was free I figured why not? especially since I don't plan on rushing back to the wheel anytime soon.",-1,0
"Sorry High Roller, you overlook way too many parking lots. This doesn't come even close to the London eye. It over looks Vegas mostly when you reach the top. Overall the ride is comfortable and enjoyable but certainly not the best I have been on so far. The staff is friendly and informative.",-1,0
"A neat ONE TIME experience but not worth $36 550 feet up at the very top and funny commentary inside the cabin Daytime is cheaper than night time, of course. Kids 12 and under are free. They offer $5 Military and they also have a local discount that is almost 1/2 off",-1,0
"The high roller gives you a unique experience of getting to see an aerial view of all of Vegas. So in that regard it was pretty cool.  But I think once is enough for me.  My husband and I got lucky on our timing and managed to get happy hour prices to the adult cabin, but so did about ten other people... and they just kind of pack you in.  Honestly, unless you only want a couple of drinks, it's not worth it. The bartender was pleasant, and tried to keep up, but it's Vegas, and with that many people it was hard.",-1,0
"This is a lot of money for a half hour view of the city. It was supposed to be romantic but we got stuck on there with two very intoxicated people who were very loud and kept talking to us. Ugh. I think they need to lower the prices for sure, and as for the drunk people, I don't have a solution. Guess that's just Vegas",-1,0
"Apparently this review is long past due.  I rode the High Roller a couple of years ago and must have forgotten to write about it.  I should preface this by saying I HATE FERRIS WHEELS!  They scare the crap out of me.  And it isn't the height.  I don't mind that.  There is just something about Ferris wheels that bother me.  But I came here with my family (Grandma and her sisters, Dad and Step-mom) and they wanted to ride.  Who am I to tell my grandma ""no?""    I think we boarded right around sunset and the lighs of the valley were starting to shine brighter than the stars in the sky.  I noticed first how smooth the motion is on this giant observation wheel.  I didn't like that very much.  I could not feel the movement but I could see it.  It was messin' with my head, man.  The views were pretty amazing though.  And it was cool to watch the video screen on the way up as they told how high you were.  That kept my mind from realizing how off balance I was becoming. I was afraid that the 30 minutes it takes to go around was going to seem like forever.  It actually went pretty quickly.  Not too quickly though.  I was happy to step out of the pod and onto solid ground again.  It was an interesting experience but not one that I would care to do again.  Especially with the prices they charge.  One and done.",-1,0
Worth visiting once but it is just a big Ferris wheel.  Spokesperson was a bit cheesy.  We went during the day as we walked by. It was mainly views of parking lot on lower level but higher up was good.    I am sure it's better at night but won't be back.  Nothing special other than height.  You can easily get a good view just going to ghost bar.,-1,0
"My friends and I went her 2 days for the happy hour. Our first experience was amazing as to why we decided to come back a 2nd time. Our second experience wasn't great at all.   We first went with Lupe during the Happy hour. She's by far amazing. She made everyone in the pod hyped up and excited for the 30 minutes to begin. She was super friendly and was very quick with making our drinks. She was never rude or mad that we were wanting drinks practically like every minute. She was the best bartender that we've experience and that made us want to go the next day with our other friend that would be joining our group.   The 2nd time came along and we got Amanda as our bartender. She didn't say hi when we walked into the pod and not welcoming to any of the other guests that joined with us. You can automatically tell that she didn't want to work and was pretty much arguing with other people in the pod. This wasn't the great service that we received before and very disappointed. We probably only was able to get like 2 drinks throughout the 30 minutes since she was arguing with other people and that she was just not into it. I was personally embarrassed that we hyped up this Ferris wheel to our friend.  TBH the only reason why this got a 3 was because of Lupe. If it was Amanda, I would've gave it a 1 star no problem.",-1,0
"Ride is pricey.  It has some spectacular views but not the best.  I think the views from the Eiffel Tower and Stratosphere are better.  There are some nice views looking east of the strip and some views between the hotels looking onto the strip.  From the strip, walk through the new outdoor mall to the ticket office.  There are some bars and restaurants.  I like the old school neon signs.  The ride is about 30 minutes and during the ride, a video plays giving out some stats about the ride and historical trivia questions about Las Vegas.  Overall, it was worth it the one time.  I probably would not do it again unless some friends wanted to do it.",-1,0
"So I heard about the High Roller and finally decided to check it out. I was so excited to go on this High Roller because I heard they had a bar in the pods.  So the on one I got on didn't have a bar in the pod but there was a bar before you go into the pod. The drinks are a little high but at the time I wasn't worried about it so I got a Henny. I didn't get some cheap deal on the tickets because I didn't care but I know I could've gotten a cheaper ticket.  The view wasn't all that great because you're not on the strip you actually behind the strip. It does take a good 30 minutes for the ride to end so you get your monies worth. There wasn't any music playing or anything really to get the party started. Yes, I understand this is also a family ride but I'm just saying.  Would I ride the High Roller again? Probably not it's just a tourist trap in my opinion.",-1,0
"Let me start with the negatives and why I only gave three stars:  Grossly overpriced. Yes it is Vegas and the strip, but it's not like I have a private pod or free alcohol flowing as I boringly look out at the landscape. Oh, wait. I have a 'high view' with A/C blowing on me. There's the savings!!.......not. Also there shouldn't be day to evening costs. Not to mention it's about 30 min. ride roundtrip. It's just not the best experience in town.   We did it for that 'once in a lifetime' feel and I'm happy to say I have been on it but that's about where it ends.   Save your $$ and visit the top of Stratosphere; eat dinner in the Paris eiffel tower; or just take a ride on the strip monorail. You'll have a more enjoyable time.",-1,0
"The High Roller is really cool, mainly because you can drink on it. We went on during the day since it's cheaper but I wish we had gone on at night. It takes 30 minutes to go all the way around and it's a HUGE pod that you're in. I went with 2 friends and we shared the pod with two older ladies, it was so boring. If we knew how big the pods were, we would have brought more people. They have this automated video on the screen the whole, with a ""host"" talking about the view and talking about Vegas, I get their point but it was a little annoying. They should just play music instead. They have a bar right before you go in to get on the ride, so if you don't have a drink already (yes, you can BYOB) get one! The view is fantastic from that high up but during the day, it's kind dull, I only recommend going at night!",-1,0
"We bought the happy half hour-It was the most amazing experience, great views, great service, great drinks. AND THEN...a guy peed in the trash can. Drink service stopped. Felt bad for all on board but no apologies from the company. A buzz kill.",-1,0
"My wife and I went on Memorial Day 2014 and to our surprise they gave Military Service members ONLY a FREE PASS and that's the reason why I gave it a 3 star instead of 1 star.  PROS: Plenty of parking in the back of The High Roller. Short walking distance and ADA accessible.  A nice Mini Street Mall (Check out Sprinkle's red velvet!!! I like it even if I hate cupcakes lol the wife forced fed me)  Recognizes Military Service Members.   Staff are friendly.  Classy, clean environment.  No waiting time (May 26 @ 1900 hrs).   CONS: They put too many people per cabin and it wasn't even that busy.  The wheel turns TOO FAST!!! If you are in the cab facing West (Facing The Strip) as if the wheel is a clock, going 6-5-4-3-2-1 o' Clock (turning counter-clockwise) you won't be able to see anything but a big wall of the hotel (Mirage?) so it's really nothing to see there. From 12-11-10 o'Clock is where you can see some DECENT VIEW of the strip. You'll have ONLY 8 mins to do so, so make it count!!! At 9-8-7-6 o'Clock are a bunch of NOTHING. So you'll sit and put up with the drunk, overly friendly crowd with you and some may have Vegas Syndrome (Jeeezzz I sound like a grouchy old fart lol)  It's not high enough to see anything on the strip. You'll see SOME nice views of the SMALL PART of the strip (Bellagio) on the window facing SSW. So sit at the SSW-W side of the cabin to make it SOMEWHAT worth it or it would be a complete waste of your time and money. SSE window is being blocked by a metal running in the middle, so you have to stick your face against the glass to see anything worth watching.  Can't get a decent  photo as you have to wrestle people to move out of the way or you'll never get a chance. Taking pictures with flash is a NO GO as the flash reflects on the glass ruining the background. So set up your camera for night shot w/ no flash before hopping in or while going up.  $25 bucks PP DAY and $35 bucks PP NIGHT (Starts at 6 PM if I can remember it right) Any other than a Memorial Day Pass, I would have rated it a 1 Star... I hope I've given you guys a heads-up...",-1,0
"Do this once because it is worth the view. It is not something I would do a second time. Plenty of other roof top locations at the major hotels to spend this money on a couple of drinks and enjoy the view.  I agree with many of the other reviews -- the guy in the video is annoying. I would rather learn more about Vegas than hear a joke about ""getting high"" at ""420"" feet.",-1,0
"In a nutshell, it's worth riding...ONCE.  The ferris wheel is constantly moving, so you have to step on to the platform as the pod approaches. Once you're inside, the pod is fairly large. It's larger than a walk-in closet, but smaller than a small bedroom (about 200 sq. ft. I think?) At first, I had to adjust to being on a ferris wheel. But it goes so slowly, that you don't know even feel like it's really moving.  The view was good, although most of it is the rooftops of casinos. But for a 360 degree view, it was pretty nice. The novelty wore off after awhile. You can only do so much while you're in the air. It's good for a large party because you can keep entertained, but for pairs and small groups, it might be a little boring after a while.  The ride went by pretty quickly too. I don't know that I'd ride it again if I have to pay for the $25 (daytime price) again, but it was definitely something you would want to do once while visiting Vegas. For a Vegas local like me, it might not be as exciting. Maybe next time I'll try the night time ride.",-1,0
"Disappointing, a lot of hype about not a lot! Good views of the strip at night. Ticket counter staff very good dealing with a ticketing anomaly, very polite and apologetic. Very irritating screen presentation once onboard the high roller.",-1,0
"One of the lucky ones! I happened to be strolling through the recently opened Linq and discovered that the view High Roller was about to open for business, so they were giving free preview rides.  I was also lucky to happen by about 15 after they started giving away rides so I only had to wait 30 min to get on.   Over all, it's a fantastic view, especially at night and if you've not been to Vegas much you get to see a lot. However, about 1/2 of the view is obstructed by the hotels closest to the ride. The other 1/2 is rather nice, but you can really only see the parts of the strip where there are low rise buildings. (I actually had a better view of the strip as I landed on my airplane)   It is a fantastic opportunity and pretty cool to be that high up.  It's a pleasant 30 min ride with plenty of room to move about the cabin despite 35 people inside. I was waiting to see what pricing they put on it before I made a final conclusion. $25 before 6pm, $35 after 6pm (both with advance ticket purchase) and $60 to buy and ride immediately.   Unfortunately, I don't think it's anywhere near worth that price. Especially when you start multiplying it by multiple family members.  Will be interested to see how busy it is on a summer day...likely lots of people willing to pay that.   5 stars for it being the highest in the world  4 stars for the view  3 stars for the experience (got bored about 20 min in) 2 stars for the price 3 stars overall",-1,0
"If you are scared of heights like I am, do not ride this.  Also, I paid extra for express tickets to skip the lines.  There was no line on a Wednesday night so it was a waste to upgrade.  There isn't a lot of seating room so be prepared to stand for a half hour.  In my opinion, it is way over priced even without the upgrade.  Of course, what isn't over priced on the strip?",-1,0
"Located in the Moray Park retail park, this is one of the biggest Sainsbury's close to central Edinburgh. I had my hopes up for a great Sainsbury's haven since I really like the Sainsbury's stores in general. Although this is a big store with much more selection than the local stores, the customer experience wasn't warm, friendly, and inviting. The vegetables, meat, and dairy items were easy enough to find but trying to find a lightbulb proved extremely difficult and, after searching the entire store, I finally went to customer service to ask and they showed me how they were located at the end of an aisle by the checkout counters at the far end. Who would have thought they would not actually be in the aisles dealing with home things? The staff weren't particularly friendly and I had hoped for much better from this store.",-1,0
"A bit too expensive for this lowly pleb but sometimes you just have to go crazy and treat yourself to a Sainsburys 14 inch triple cheese meatfest pizza rather than your ordinary Lidl's option. Beware though, this is the coldest supermarket in Edinburgh, take a coat with you, even in summer!",-1,0
not a bad place for a pint before a game.... but it can get packed!!!  i also found out that they don't have a food menu... you get your food from a different part of the bar and bring it back to your seat....   the large outside area is awesome because it is so big...,-1,0

"When going here before a Diamondback game, don't expect fast service.  Sure, they are trying to do all they can, but dang - there are a LOT of you!  Suns games are pretty bad too, though when comparing sold out games, there are just more Diamondback folks trying to get in.  The nice thing is, Suns fans want to get out of there and head over before tip off.  Most Baseball fans will head over where whenever they're done because they know they have a good 8 hours to go.  Ok, lots of sports detail I know.  But w/ Jackson's on 3rd, it's all about Sports.  If you're thinking of heading over, check the sports schedules in the area before you make any firm plans.   Besides that - huge bar.  When it's empty (a non-game day) it seems even bigger.  But that can work great if you want to meet a crowd there for a non-sports event.  The dance club space has been a bit more hit and miss over the years.  It went from lame to cool to not so hot to, well maybe if we're in the area anyhow...  Who knows where it will be when you go, but it's a decent sized space, a big bar and a good amount of seating so you'll definitely get your drink on, even if you don't get your groove on.",-1,0
"Although I've never had a bad experience here or felt like I was walking into a rooting-interest goocher (I'm something like 5-0 here as a spectator), I cannot really recommend this as a destination spot for game watching.  I really have a problem with the dynamics of the TV arrangements, and although they all appear to be plasma (not LCD), someone here lacks the capability or willingness to change a number of their broadcasts to HD until well into 'the game' or never at all.  The table positioning is awkward at best.  They force you into a 45 degree angle, where, if you have 4-5 people in the group, 3 are forced at painful angles for sustained TV viewing.  And before Dbacks games, this place looks like the Texas polygamist ranch, with all the kids and their daddies in here.  Its too much.  Their semi-shaded patio and brick-warehouse structure is gorgeous tho.  If you can snag a spot out front, the atmosphere feels pretty enthusiastic and wholly uplifting, truth be told.  Almost like a real sports/entertainment district.  Food is awful, but really who cares?  You're here for the beer and they have that.  It just might not be the place you'd wanna be unless you fancy a quick round or two before a Dbacks or Suns game.",-1,0
"The other night my friend ordered take out from here and it was pretty good. We ordered a bunch of different rolls, sushi and sashimi. The rolls were good, considering I'm not able to have any of the delicious sauces that normally go on gourmet style rolls. The ones we ordered were filled with salmon, avocado, cucumber, crab and some had salmon slices on the outside. Allover they were really good. The sushi and sashimi was good as well. For the most part, the sashimi was pretty fresh with a few exceptions where I avoided eating some due to its appearance.   Allover I was happy with my take-out experience and I would try dining in their restaurant or ordering take-out for an event. I'll just have to get a copy of their menu, since they don't have a website.",-1,0
"Average quality sushi place but with a really good price tag. If you want good sushi at a low price, here is the place for you.",-1,0
"Your typical family run sushi place. Small, large portions for a cheap price, quality is meh. Their rolls are gigantic and their tempura roll is surprisingly tasty. Don't go for their Udon special, not recommended.  There are only seats for 6 people in this tiny join. one two person table directly in front of the door, and one four seater beside the door. Pick your poison if you get lucky or order take out, which is what most ppl do.",-1,0
"So I finally decided to venture out here on a weekday night for cheap cheap sushi. We tried a fair share of the GTA's Japanese restaurants and prefer to stick to sushi a la carte for portion control.    For ambience, there are only about 4 tables of two and it sort of feels like your Asian grandma's tea room (if you have ever been around one) and so if you are looking for a romantic date night, this might not cut the cake.  This sushi restaurant is a cheap eat and so, you should treat it as such.  Most customers went for the take-out route (CASH ONLY, gosh that is so inconvenient nowadays).  Or else, like a well-practiced act, you might get a scowl face from the female japanese cashier who then, out of frustration, subsequently hands you a debit machine in a covert fashion (I witnessed this many times).    We ordered spicy salmon, dragon roll (shrimp tempura) and spider roll. The sushi rolls are GINORMOUS, as in 3 inches in diameter (and that might be an understatement).  The sushi chefs have definitely adopted the Texan way of making sushi.   The spicy salmon everyone raves about is honestly siracha chili sauce packed with salmon sashimi (it was 4.99). Cheap, creative but definitely didn't quite hit the spot and didn't taste the way spicy salmon is done elsewhere in the city.   The Spider roll was unconventional in that it contained egg, avocado, cucumber, salmon(?), and soft shell crab.  Suffice to say, it was STUFFED and could be considered a meal for two in itself. The dragon roll was equally large. Each maki took two huge jawfuls to chew. As other reviewers had mentioned, if you are eating here, you must prefer quantity over quality.   I might come back for a cheap bite if I'm in the Yonge/Sheppard/Finch area. I would only recommend it to someone who just feels like filling up on sushi on a dime.",-1,0
"Great for take out - but not meant as a dine in.  Over all, there's high value at this place, and freshness.  Where they fall short is on the technical side of the sushi itself.",-1,0
For what you pay the food is good. This place is a great take out restaurant but if you go when it is busy your guaranteed to get terrible customer service.,-1,0

"This is my second time visiting and I'm pleased with my sushi. I ordered sushi combo c which has twelve pcs of sushi and spicy salmon roll. It is good if u want a quick sushi fix. The spicy salmon roll doesn't taste like those we used to have, it doesn't have the spicy mayo? The salmon got a greyish colour on the side... i assume the quality is not very high. I'm very pleased with the service cuz its quick.  However while i was waiting i saw the cashier girl cut the cucumbers with her bare hands and touched the screen to take orders then picked up a phone call... then went bk on her cucumbers again without washing her hands...... :/ i wish i didnt see that...",-1,0
Really large and cheap sushi. I always take out from there. But yesterday after eat from them I got food poisoned. Still vomiting today.,-1,0
"Its steady eddie rolls. I would avoid their dinners as they are not quite competent with a couple dishes i ordered. For rolls they are decent so go nuts. If you want to do it Korean style, pay .50 more and get the cho -jang, korean hot sauce for your rolls.",-1,0
"Fastest take out ever.  I went in, ordered my food, and in 5 minutes, they had it ready for us.  I was quite pleased. :)",-1,0
"The size of the sushi here is enormous! It's a small store underneath a condo building, with very few seats for dine-ins. Most people order take out, and order either the Dynamite Roll or Spider Roll.   My favourite is the moon river roll - for some reason, they stuff this roll with huge pieces of avocado (yum). There isn't much of a wait time, the chefs make the sushi fairly fast even when there's a huge line. If you ever dine in, please note that everything is self serve. You have to pour yourself water - I realized that only after asking for tea - the waitress pointed me towards the plastic cups on the side. I'm surprised they even have a ""TIPS"" jar by the cashier.   Overall, the sushi isn't amazing, but it's decent and worth the value. It's convenient for me since I live around the area, but it's definitely worth a try just to see the size of the sushi!",-1,0
"I'm sad to do this, but I'm downgrading from my previous 4-star review from 3 years ago.  Once upon a time things were much fresher and less fast-food style.  That said, the price to value ratio is still excellent, and if you're craving some sushi that won't kill your wallet, it's not a bad take-out option.  Don't love or crave it like I used to, but still a reliable option.",-1,0
Too much vinegar in the rice but the price is very competitive. Good place for take outs.,-1,0
"UPDATed my review from 4 to 3 star. Having been living in the neighbourhood for half year now, been to this place countless times. Sad to say this is no longer my fav sushi place. The portions (fish) in the rolls are getting less generous. Very slim slices of fish in the rolls. Not very impressed. Price is still same and affordable tho!   It's mostly for take out as there is only 2 tables available howver have sat in on mutiple occasions. Authentic Japanese.  Very hard to find parking as it is in a condo plaza.",-1,0
This is a very small store off of Yonge St. just south of Finch. It's almost hidden if you don't look for the street. Only 10 ppl can sit down at a time. Most people order take out. It was Saturday when we arrived around 6pm so it was fairly early. We decided to dine it. This is a CASH ONLY place. The sushi was okay.  The sushi/sashimi platter came with super duper big pieces of maki rolls that almost didn't fit into our mouths. The taste wasn't bad but I wasn't totally like totally wow. The Salmon Nigiri was thinly sliced. The pieces were small. I've had better sushi. Also want to mention you need to pay for parking. It's a circle driveway so space is very limited. There is no washroom in the store you would have to go to Metro supermarket behind the building.,-1,0
"I mean I was high, like Snoop Dogg high! You know because he's so tall!   The High Roller is a pretty cool way to see the lights of Las Vegas from 550ft up in the air, which by the way is highest point of the continuously moving ride which takes 30 minutes to complete a full revolution. You will be stuck in a floating orb with a bunch of randoms, but it's not as tight of space as you might think, plus it's air conditioned!   The High Roller is definitely a tourist destination, but sometimes it fun to play tourist in your own neighborhood. Things on the strip can be a little pricey, but most places do offer local discounts. The High Roller is a good example of this, offering 30% off tickets prices to locals on Tuesdays with a free drink, as apart of the ""Tuesday Night Bloq Party"". They also have a nightly happy hour that happens after 10pm. This tickets will cost ya, but it  includes a full bar that gets to ride with you while you take the 30 minute trip above the Strip, in my opinion this isn't needed. I had a full beer with me on the ride and was so busy looking and taking pictures of the view, I still had about half of it when I departed the Vegas style ferris wheel.   The High Roller is a bit pricey, but is something you should try at least once as a local. Remember, local peeps, get local deals! I probably wouldn't do this again on my own, but if my favorite auntie came to visit I would recommend this as something she should check-out.   P.S. - Go at night. I mean who wants to look at the Vegas valley at one in the afternoon, right?",-1,0
"My wife and I got tickets to the High Roller as part of a package we bought, so we figured we would give it a shot.  We probably wouldn't have ridden it if not for the packaged tickets, as it seemed like a glorified Ferris wheel to us.  Seriously, we figure there are much more attractive and exciting things for us to spend our time doing in Vegas.  We went just after sunset on a weeknight.  The boarding process was a little more complicated and disorganized than it should have been, but that was because there were tickets available for a full bar option or just the regular ride.  Our tickets were for the regular ride, so I think it was a tad less complicated than the full bar option.  There weren't enough employees present to guide us through the process, but we were able to negotiate the ticketed passenger entry, the escalator, the ""souvenir"" photo spot, and the queue line. We found that if we just kept walking, we eventually ended up at the boarding area.  The ride was basically get on the pod, spend around 25 minutes rotating slowly around the wheel, watch a hokey video, and enjoy the view.  Our pod had around 20 people in it and we had plenty of room to roam about the cabin.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the ride.  We did enjoy the experience and view, although this is something we probably won't do again.  We can say we've done it, enjoyed it, and it is something worth trying if you can get a good discount.  A solid three stars.",-1,0
View from top was so nice at night!! I could see all the lovely colors! But i think it's a little too pricey for the experience!,-1,0
"We went there to have a good time, but the whole experience was a terrible one. First off went to the ticket window that is right next to it that is a window in a wall. The girl was very rude. At one point I asked her if there was a discount for locals (as I was handing her my credit card). She said no but if I have a Total Rewards card there is a discount. I asked her not to charge the credit card, and where I can get a Total Rewards card (it is the players card for Harrahs, Caesars, etc). She said she didn't know then SWIPED MY CARD! I told her I did not give her permission to do that and that I wanted it refunded. She told me there were no refunds. I told her to get me a manager to refund it or I will call the card company and have them cancel it there on that end. The manager came over, canceled it, and told me that I could get a total rewards card a couple doors down! Ugh! well I got it, and noticed that there was an indoor place to get the tickets there. So I got tickets from much nicer people and went on the ride. Now the ride is still expensive at $34 at night (why go during the day?) and the first 25% and last 25% is a view of a parking lot and sides of building. So only the middle half is good. Do it once when friends are in town as I doubt anyone would do it twice.",-1,0
"Original   I'm all about Vegas's commitment to improving the Family experience and finding creative was to engage us all in an activity that offers an opportunity to look at the beauty of the world, Vegas, in new ways.  However, I've ridden this twice now and unless I wanted to get blasted on the 'all-you can drink bar' I'm not sure this qualifies as an idea that's been completely thought out.  It goes up, it comes down. Who knows, maybe that's just life reflected in a slow moving mirror, but I still say it's missing something...  I don't know what yet, but something.",-1,0
"We had free tickets with free drinks.  I'm glad I went, but I'm also glad I didn't pay for it.  You go up really high.  Since it's behind a lot of big, tall buildings, some views are very limited.  If you want a view, the Stratosphere tower is better.  There are other good views of the Strip (many hotel rooms with Strip views, Voodoo Lounge, Ghostbar, Foundation Room)  I can understand how people from small towns who've never been above 5 stories in a building would be ""amazed"" by going up 550 feet.  How much it's worth will depend upon how much you value being 550 feet above the backside of the Strip.",-1,0
"I have gone on the High Roller twice now.. once during the day & the other at night.  The daytime visit: There is a locals deal $5 off per person & each adult admits a youth. Since my sister has 3 little ones, I got to tag along with her family. We printed our tickets at home & waited a short time in line (they chose the first ride time of the day). After that, you walk through.. they have a little bag check, then you head up & there's a bar, then before you get in line to board a pod, there's an option to take pictures in front of a green screen.  There were about 15 people on the pod & it was great.. not too crowded & everyone wandered to every corner to check out the views. There are screens at the top of the pod with a guy talking (didn't pay too much attention, obviously) & it displayed how many feet we were ascending periodically. When you are about to reach the top, they do a countdown which is pretty fun. The ride is approximately 30 minutes & it doesn't even feel like you're moving. Overall, daytime visit was not bad.. pictures came out decent & not too much reflection.  The night time visit: my relatives were visiting, so we decided to check out the High Roller at night because they (& I) wanted pictures of the Strip at night when it's all lit up. So, there was a total of 11 of us, which from my first visit, I assumed that they'd only fit a few more people onto the pod with us. Um, WRONG. There were about 25 of us.. give or take a person or two. So I understand that these pods can fit up to 40 people but you shouldn't do it. It totally took away from the experience. Also, people should be courteous to others.. don't stick to one part of this small space! I think the best part of the pod is the southwest corner which one couple hogged & would not move because they were in their own world taking selfies.  I'm excited that Las Vegas has the highest observation wheel at the moment. If you have 30 minutes to kill.. check it out!",-1,0
"My husband and I went on the HR a few weeks after it was open.  I am not aware if there is a locals discount nor did the ticket person ask if we were locals. We paid the $34.95 each. We came on a Wednesday night and went right up to the front of the line.   There was one other group in front of us. But they put all seven of us together in the same pod. They had an annoying child who kept jumping up and down. They had drinks and were buzzed, how do I know? They did not use their indoor voices. Wow.  Even at a discount it would not have changed my mind. It's just overhyped. 550ft is nice but I honestly think it would have been better if they positioned further back from the Strip. Or maybe if it was even taller. Yes I think they could have built it even taller...  Yes the sunset was pretty, yes it is a cool view of the buildings but I would say that only about the top 550ft view. Going up and going down is just meh.   Three stars.",-1,0
"We're locals, so we were really excited to finally experience the High Roller. The line was long so we bought our tickets at the kiosk. They cost $40 each. As we were walking in, we noticed a sign that says locals save $5. We mentioned that we just bought tickets and didn't get the $5 discount & the employee told us if we bought them at the kiosk, it was too late to get the discount. He was quite rude about it. We figured we'd deal with it after our ride & proceeded to the attraction. There's a bar there, so we bought a couple drinks & waited in line for the ride. The drinks were expensive, but we knew the drinks would be at this new tourist attraction.   The pods you sit in were really nice. We were with about 10 other people, which was fine, we didn't feel overcrowded and it was easy to move within the pod. The view was magnificent, of course. The ride is about 30 min long. If you're afraid of Ferris wheels, don't be afraid of this one. It goes so slow, you don't even feel like you're moving.  When we finished the ride, we tried to see if we could get our $5 local discount. The girl we talked to was even more rude about it than the first guy we spoke to. She actually rolled her eyes at me. My boyfriend then asked to speak to a manager. She basically refused to get the manager until we continually insisted on seeing a manager. We were then led to the manager by a different employee. The manager quickly apologized & credited $10 to my boyfriend's credit card. In addition to the $5 discount, she said locals 17 and under ride free.  However, we didn't see this special posted anywhere. I'm sure lots of families would come if their kids ride free. Why offer these discounts if they don't really advertise them?  We paid $70 for the tickets & another $25 for 2 drinks. For $95, I'd say go to Ghostbar or the Voodoo Lounge & enjoy the same view &  enjoy more than 1 cocktail!",-1,0

"I took my family on the High Roller in July 2016, and we thought the ride offered great views, but was nothing special.  The price for an adult is $35, children under 12 are free.  There are many Groupons and living socials deals to save you a couple of dollars.  You enter a bubble, and as the giant wheel makes one complete revolution you get incredible views of the Las Vegas Strip.  The revolution takes about 30-40 minutes.  The wheel moves very slow and is very stable, if not for the changing view, you would not even know you were moving.  The only down side is that you are crammed in the pod with a lot of people you don't know.  If one of them is a drunk bung-hole, it will be a long 30 minutes.  After you get off the ride, you'll be offered to buy your green screen picture that you took prior to entering the High Roller for the special price of $50!!!  Are they serious?!?  I guess if you are in a group of people on you all share the price it's no big deal.  But if you are just a couple or a family, that is a lot for a posed picture.  If you have never been on the High Roller I would recommend doing it at least once, but only once in the evening, to get the best views.  Make sure you get a deal and don't pay full price.",-1,0

"My family and I experienced the ride last weekend while in town. It's kinda neat at night to ride if your not looking for high speed and thrills. Very scenic at the top, kinda one of those things you can check off your list that you did it. The only complaint it's a little pricy.",-1,0
"We went on a beautiful Wednesday night which wasn't overly crowded.. This new ride was fun,beautiful views,clean but come on over $75.00 for 2 is pricey. It is definitely not a thrill or much excitement rather than just a fun time. Never would I pay for it again.....",-1,0
"I bought a Living Social voucher for $25 for 30 minutes and open bar. I enjoyed myself, but definitely would NOT pay full price for this. They pack about 25 people in each pod with only one bartender. It would have been nicer if there were two bartenders. The regular pods (without alcohol) have less people in them. The pods are WAY bigger than they appear. There is not much seating inside either, so prepare to stand. Try to go at dusk or night to enjoy all the lights. We even saw the Bellagio fountains dancing from the High Roller.",-1,0
"I was lucky that we got to experience this free, because it was not super exciting and the price  is not what I would ever pay to do this, but we both found it enjoyable.  The video that plays was funny, but it was also a distraction from being in the moment and taking in the view.   At the time I felt like I was dragging my husband through this and since it was hot, I felt really bad about it. Luckily afterward I heard him telling others about it and he thought it was kinda a cool thing, but agreed it wouldn't be something that you would need to do more than once and that the price was too high.  It would have been worth it if the admission and bar drinks were included, at about $20 for me. So maybe after all the hype has died down, they will make it more reasonably priced?  If you are dragging around someone that is hurting, probably best to Valet the car. lol",-1,0
"This was something my mom was dead set on doing in Vegas, so we walked to the hotel and experienced this gigantic Ferris wheel. It isn't really much of an adventure, so I think the price is kind of a joke. The view is great, it really is, expect there are much taller buildings in the way at certain intervals.   The people who work here clearly don't care and that is upsetting when you are on vacation, and even more upsetting since this is a new attraction and these people are already not amused. The employees at any attraction are just as important as the attraction, look at Disney's philosophy, so maybe this company should put more emphasis on how they treat and train their employees.",-1,0
Lots of hype; tickets were free so won't complain.  Beautiful view of strip at night but hard to take pictures of it due to reflection from glass.,-1,0
We bought a groupon for 2 people. Price was about 65.00. We did one circle that took 30 minutes. Im glad we got to experience it but i wouldnt do it more than once. The views were so-so. The stratosphere has better views and more to do so i think thats the way to go.,-1,0

"Move over Singapore Flyer! You are no longer the tallest observation wheel in the world!   The High Roller at The Linq in Las Vegas is!  Nestled behind The Imperial Palace, er I mean, The Linq is a giant wheel of metal and glass bubbles that does one rotation inside of 30 minutes!  My gf and I were lucky that our timing was impeccable because we arrived when one of the pods was almost out of entrance range, that there was only one other couple inside it.  Unlike the other pods where there were more than 6-8 people inside!  It is almost as if we had the pod to ourselves, almost!  While the overall environment controlled cabin was pleasent, the seating could have been improved by using padded seats instead of the hard, sterile plastic that awaited our butts! Not that it mattered too, too much as you would find yourself standing most of the time in this ride marveling at the bright Vegas strip lights below!   What is definitely sorely needed is a way to disable the annoying infomercial playing on the screen inside the cabin.  The host of the informative show was tolerable the first 5 minutes, but a whole 30 minutes of badly scripted jokes and anecdotes,  one has had enough crass!   Perhaps there should be a way to switch to a radio station, or to satellite radio playing music instead?  The High Roller is best experienced during night time, or at dusk. Although, I wouldn't mind going during the day if the oppportunity came up.    The selections at the pre-boarding bar could be a little bit better, as it was quite pricy.  Like most tourist attractions, you can't bring your own food or drinks, even if it is Vegas where one could get intoxicated on the strip itself!  Happy high rolling!",-1,0
We had fun! The ride takes about 30-40 minutes and the night view of Vegas is awesome.  Upon arriving we saw a huge line but then realized it was to purchase your ticket. We bought our tickets online and printed them at home and we walked right on. There is a bar to buy drinks before you get on. During the ride t.v. screens are telling you how high you are while on the ride.  It was fun but a little too expensive for my taste.,-1,0
"It seems like the views look way better at night. The view was cool at 4:30pm, but nothing super impressive. Also, I wouldn't suggest going on this if you're afraid of heights.   We got a deal where it was unlimited drinks while the wheel goes around for about half an hour. Luckily, it wasn't too crowded and the bartender makes the drinks pretty quickly. As skeptical as I was, it really was unlimited drinks. My friend definitely took advantage. Let's just say it didn't end up well after we got off.  Overall, it's pretty chill, unlimited drinks, check out the vegas view and just hang out. It was cool for this one time, but I probably wouldn't do this again. Well, maybe a night for a cool view.",-1,0
"A-OK. We got a living social deal for a ride on the High Roller and a drink up to the value of $9 for $18 each, It was a few more dollars for the night time ride, We turned up showed our ticket and went to get a drink from the bar, the whole building was pretty cool! A bit like a theme park queue at Disneyland, then it was time to board our pod, i think we got lucky as there was a huge party before us who all got in one pod together then we were next and we were in a pod with only a few others so i think its all pot luck on what time you go, The whole ride takes around 30 minutes with a pretty annoying video commentary of some annoying guy, The pods are quite large with plastic hard seating in places around the pod, but you do get a 360 degree view of Las Vegas through the big windows around the pod, Unfortunatly though the view isn't all that great, all you get to see is the back of the Hotels,the mountains in the distance  and the Airport,  and we got a better view from our hotel at the Cosmopolitan. Though it was cool to go on the tallest observation wheel in the world at a staggering 550ft!!!",-1,0
Glad we went at night.   The trivia was fun. The comedian video host was.... trying. The views were AMAZING. 30 minute ride - it moves much slower than you expect it to.,-1,0
"I enjoyed this ride but did have an issue with the happy hour day charge versus night charge.  We purchased the tickets through a third-party vendor and had to pay $10 to upgrade to the evening.  Gratefully, the staff accommodated our request to change to the evening - I just want everybody to be aware of the small print!  Great views and Reese was a wonderful bartender!",-1,0
"For a panoramic view experience, they're better places in Las Vegas. First of all, to get to the high roller entrance, you will have to walk a lot. We took the monorail, seeing that it stops a few yards from the wheel, but in reality, you have to return to the strip to get to the street that leads to the high roller entrance. So I wouldn't recommend the monorail to go there.  Once you get to the entrance, there's a quick bag security check and off you go in the next line to be selected by groups of 10 to 15.  Because the experience lasts 30 minutes, I really needed to make sure I could sit. The employee was really nice and accommodating and made sure I was up front to enter and choose my seat.  The concept is really cool and he view is nice. We were lucky and got to see the Bellagio fountain show while on top of the wheel, which made the experience quite unique and fun. The first and last few minutes are not impressive as you only see the ugly close by building, but once you pass the half way point it makes it nice.  Make sure you do your research as they're many offers to do this very cheap. Enjoy the view.",-1,0
"We happened to get some free tickets to ride the High Roller on a recent trip to Vegas. We had a busy day and night with shows, gambling, and sightseeing, so we didn't make it to the High Roller until around 1 am. This was actually a great time to go as there were very few people in line. Our group had six people and a baby, and we wound up getting a pod with us and one other person. This was great because we were able to wander around the pod at our leisure without worrying about getting in someone else's way or photo.   The ride lasts about 30 minutes. There's some seating on the inside, but not a lot. It was fine for our small group, though we didn't sit too much anyways. It revolves at a slow pace, so you can't really feel the movement. The views are nice, though I think you get a better view from Mix Lounge at Mandalay Bay. It's a cool one-time experience. However, if I got free tickets again, I would probably give it another go.",-1,0
Finally got to ride the High Roller last week and I must say it's a little overrated. I wouldn't have paid full price for it. Beautiful night view but after 15 mins I got bored and just sat down the rest of the ride. The tv and the lame music they play got annoying. As everybody else said this would be a one time try.,-1,0
"The new High Roller located at The Linq is the world's tallest observation wheel that provides a 360 degree view of Las Vegas and the Strip. Being a local, I decided that I would go ahead and try it out (mostly just to say that I have done it).  Just a little about the attraction... there are a total of 28 cabins that hold about 40 passengers each. It's about a 30 minute ride that takes you 550 feet above the Strip. The cost for adults is $19.95 (open till 6PM) and $34.95 (6PM till close). We decided to go later in the evening when the views would be at their best. Luckily when we arrived (11PM or so), there wasn't a wait and were able to purchase our tickets and board the cabin within 5 minutes. There is a bar that you are able to stop at before boarding if you wish to take a drink with you. If you looking to waste a bunch of money, you can also rent a private cabin for your group (approx. $1300) or even purchase a bottle service (approx. $1800). Keep in mind, this is only good for once around so it's a pretty penny for only a 30 minute ride.   All in all, it was a fun experience. We got some great pictures and the view is amazing, but I don't know if I would pay $34.95 to do it again. It's one of those, you do it once and then never again. I know since I've gone, they've started to offer packages, local discounts and discounts through Groupon, etc. I would be sure to check those out before heading straight to the box office to get tickets.   A couple tips... TIP #1: Go at night... they open at 12PM, but the views are far better if you go during the sunset or later at night. TIP #2: I mentioned it before, but check various sites for discounts! TIP #3: If you aren't walking there, there's a valet located off of Koval (of course it's complimentary!).",-1,0
Groupon!!    Be sure to get the pod with the open bar after 10pm - it's the only way to do it!,-1,0
"Save your money, don't do it! Lol  Pros: Nice strip view up top. 21 and up slots that offer drink all you can while on the ride. Tip: buy the groupon.  Cons: Nice strip view up top. (You can just go to any strip hotel, go to the top floor and see the same thing.   21 and up slots that offer drink all you can while on the ride: go play slots, and order drink all you can. Lol  How much can you really drink in 30 mins to justify your $40 ticket? If it's $5 for the ride, I'd be more all up for it. It really isn't just worth it. t least I can say, I've done it.",-1,0
"The view is amazing but our visit was tainted by the horrible customer service we received at the beginning of our visit. The ""manager"" sat by as an employee continually condescended my family and then snapped at me when I let him know that he was rude and patronizing. Mike from the Bay Area, you have abhorrent social skills. Customer service needs to be vastly improved. Just buy your tickets in advance and don't bother with ""guest services"" so you do not have to deal with the attitude.",-1,0
"Our experience at the High Roller was not as advertised. Perhaps going during the day when the view is less spectacular helped contribute to that, but either way we felt we paid a good deal of money for a largely mediocre time.   We bought our tickets online because it shaves a few bucks off that way. We also decided to go during the day as opposed to a night ride because the difference in price was a steep $20 per person. After doing research, we chose to spend the extra money for a happy hour pod which provides access to an open bar throughout the duration of the 30 minute ride and the ticket price includes your drinks.  There are no set times on the tickets since the ride constantly rotates (even when you board, but don't worry it moves slowly). We didn't realize there is only one happy hour pod on the entire wheel, so we had to wait in line and let the others roll by until it was at ground level for us to get on.   Being the first HH ride of the day, we also had to wait for them to wheel the bar in. The line kept growing along with my anxiety from seeing the size of the pods. While spacious, we watched general admission ticket buyers (who paid less) going ahead of us (some getting a pod all to themselves) while we got to be packed in like sardines. Have I mentioned I'm both claustrophobic and terrified of heights? Talk about self-inflicted wounds.   I'm not sure why I assumed there would be a limit of 15 people or so as to not overcrowd the pods, but I was wrong. They put 25 of us in there which doesn't sound bad, until the doors close and you are having to squeeze through people to walk around and see the different views.   We also didn't realize that ""happy hour"" actually meant sales pitch hour. We now know how much it costs to rent the pods out for corporate events, holidays, and weddings. Because of an unfortunate incident of a man drinking 25 beers in one ride and then peeing in the bartenders sink, you are also not allowed to hold more than one drink at a time. As in you can't order one for your spouse on the other side of the pod and pass it to them, everyone has to come to the bar themselves and only touch their own drinks.  While I understand the reasoning behind it, it made serving everyone take longer and we were only able to get two small drinks each the entire time. Worth the price? We didn't think so.   If you still want to go however, then this is what I suggest:  1) Go at night.  2) Don't pay extra for a HH pod. The ride is short, go to the bar afterwards.  3) Snag a standing spot on the side you enter from as that's where the best view is.  4) Buy your tickets online for a better price.",-1,0
"We didn't ride this ride for a couple of reasons. It was too expensive, just about $20.  If you look for those hotel coupon books, they will give you a discount of $3-$4 per person.  We rode the London Eye in London and this looked just like it so we decided to skip it altho' we did get under it to see what it looked like.  They have electronic kiosks for you to purchase your tickets.  Not sure if the Las Vegas area is as nice to look at compared to London but $20/per person was too much in my opinion for a short ride.",-1,0
"Not a wonderful experience, but not a terrible one either. Personally, a bit mediocre, nothing breathtaking or particularly memorable -- we saw a bunch of the hotels and they were all lit up. Yet it was not as bright and flashy as I had envisioned in my head. That could be my fault, hyping it up from what others have said. It was a lot brighter and more energetic on the ground than in the air.   Overall, it was quiet in our little pod cause it was around Christmas/a weeknight around 11PM. It was only my husband and I, plus a dad and his three daughters. The music playing was lively and energetic, maybe a way to inject more fun in the experience. The young girls were dancing around and it was cute. Actually found that a bit more entertaining than the view.   I think a lot of the 5 star reviews involve the packages that come with unlimited booze. Because, anything is super fun while drunk. However, my husband and I aren't drinkers so opted for just the regular ticket.   Pricey for what the experience really is: 30 minutes long, some songs blasting. Regular night time ticket --no booze -- $37. I got discounted vouchers and paid $29 per ticket instead and I still kind of think it was a rip- off. Also the ascent was super slow, and I thought it would be a bit faster. The slow ascent was good though, because it seemed very gradual and any faster might make some people nervous or nauseous.   The staff is also very friendly from every interaction I had -- before entering the box for the ticket line, the guy manning the entrance was helpful in directing me where to go. I had never been here and had a voucher and was unsure where to go. The girl assisting us with tickets was nice. Bag check girl was sweet, commenting on how she liked my bag, saying you're welcome as we thanked them.   Once you go upstairs, there's a bar and bathrooms. I'm guessing you could buy some alcoholic beverages and take it with you? Then we pass through another area where they make us take pictures in front of a green screen, no doubt to try to sell us when we leave. It was actually very cute in terms of the background shot, but we didn't like how we looked and opted not to get it. Finally, we get to the last line area, but quickly run into the open pod as it's moving, and then we made our way up! No lines anywhere, but this was obviously not peak season in Las Vegas. At other times of the year, especially Spring/Summer, I can foresee the lines being long.   I'm not sure how many people they permit inside one pod, but hopefully they do not over pack everyone inside and have a strict limit. It would be hard to get a good view, and it might feel a bit claustrophobic. I also wonder if the pods differ in size. The non-open bar ones are small, and have less people inside. The open bar pods must accommodate a bar/staff, and a lot more people.   While mostly everyone stands, there are some seats that you can sit down if you need a little rest.   Also, the gift shop was super cute and fun to look through. I normally never buy stuff in gift shops because the mark-ups are insane, but I saw an adorable ""Sad Panda"" shirt (panda looking bummed that their mug of (presumably) beer had tipped and spilled on the ground) and could not resist the purchase. Again, those cashiers were friendly and joking around with customers behind me. For working in a quiet store at midnight, that's some good energy and customer service.",-1,0
"It's good to try once in your life, but I can't see myself doing this again. It's a good thing we had a BOGO coupon.  Pods are larger than they appear, so don't worry about overcrowding.  You can easily get these high views by going to the stratosphere or any hotel that is higher than 40 stories high.  Night views are better than day time views.",-1,0
"For $35 this was just ok. I tried to find some good deals on Living Social and Groupon  but I couldn't. The ride is only 30 minutes long but anything more than 30 minutes would've been too long.   I mainly came up here to take pictures. However, that was difficult because the windows are glass with no way to open them and that the glass was dirty. I turned off my camera flash but that only helped a little bit.",-1,0
"Do whatever you can to get a discount. Military, local, or whatever. Just make sure to ask them about discounts. Now on a serious note. Should or should you not get the open bar car or not. If you want to knock a few back, pre-game, get drunk, etc... Then you need to get the drinking car. The bartenders are really fast and trust me you can do some serious damage during the ride. The cart without the drinks is cool too. Tip... Make sure you have a good place to stand near the strip before you get to the top. Everyone will try to take pics on that side and if you wait too long, you will miss out. The view is only good for 30% of the ride.   Pros - open bar for a good price, something different, location. Parking  Cons - Price without discount, amount of folks in a car.",-1,0
"On Wednesday, July 8th at 10:50pm, I boarded the High Roller.  Luckily our group found a Groupon for One happy half hour late night package with open bar for two: valid 7pm to 1am ($75). Plus, we had 20% off on top of the Groupon price, so it ended up being $30 per person. Make sure to check in and select a time before you plan on actually going on the High Roller. We dropped by, went and had dinner and then came back.  I heard someone say they offer top shelf liquor for the open bar, but that's not true. It's the standard liquor you would expect with Jack Daniels being the whiskey. I'm a dark drinker, so I stuck to Jack and Coke. I heard someone try to order a red bull vodka, but unfortunately, they don't have any energy drinks.  Since I couldn't drink much during this open bar, I was excited that they offered Fiji water. With the one cocktail I consumed, I'm pretty sure I drank enough Fiji water to make up for the rest of the cocktails I didn't consume.  Now onto the reason for this, the Ferris Wheel! I love ferris wheels since I love views. But I realize I love them when it's quiet and serene. I've been on a number of them, but it's always been with 1-3 other people. Being in a pod with loud drinkers took a little away from that. At night, the lights of Vegas are great, but it didn't feel like we were at the top for very long. And you can't see anything on the desert side since it's just darkness.  I'm glad I finally tried the ferris wheel with friends that wanted to go as this might have been something I'd drag the roommate on. Great to try once, but I wouldn't do it again.",-1,0
The view was awesome. The ride is really slow so it does allow you to view the city at different levels. My issue was the drink prices and the way it was explained or attempted to be explained to me. I paid $18 for a frozen daqauri with an extra shot of tequila. I felt nothing. Way too high for a drink. But the ride was pretty nice. You go in a small group so don't expect to go alone unless there is no one else around.,-1,0
"I have been on the High Roller twice now and I have to say it is much more enjoyable with drinks ;-) but if you're not a drinker it's worth the views.   Let me start by saying that this is a VERY SAFE ride and if you're afraid of heights or get vertigo this might actually be a good viewing point where you will not feel overwhelmed. I brought a friend who is afraid of heights and she said she enjoyed it. The ride moves very slow so you don't really feel like you're on a ""ride"" per se. It's similar to an elevator going up (you can barely feel it).  The views are great and it takes about 30 minutes roundtrip. I recommend going up at night as night views are always nicer (in my opinion). The pods are fairly large and fit quite a few people. I have never been in a pod that was crowded so I found that seating was plenty.   It's a great ride if you want a unique view of the strip and the entire las vegas valley. I will say it's not the best spot to go if you want to get a great overhead view of the Bellagio fountains (go to the Paris Eiffel Tower Experience for that (see my review)).   I honestly couldn't say much about pricing because I always get to go up for free (That's right, I'm connected like that ;-) ) but I would say it's consistent with other attractions on the strip offering up similar views. Plus, there's alcohol!   **As long as it's not heavy rainstorm outside, it's still possible to do this ride, however, the view might not be so great. I live in Las Vegas and I've seen the High Roller operate in the rain.",-1,0
"This is an awesome experience especially with the open bar package. It is a 30 minute ride and all you can drink. We have been on it twice. The first time it was only thee couples on it and was a great experience. The second time, it would have been a small group but the group before us had a girl puking all over so we had to wait for the next one. By that time, the group grew to over 20 people on the ride. It was crowded and you could not see much since all the spaces on the ride was packed. I was real annoyed with that.",-1,0
"I had to go on the High Roller for business a few weeks ago. Luckily I live in Las Vegas so it only cost me $20. I think like every other Las Vegas corporate gouging this attraction to is up there. Not sure of the non-resident fee but it ain't cheap.  I understand that they're not doing well, which comes as no great surprise.. People just can't afford to shell out that kind of money to see basically the same view they could see from the top of their hotel.",-1,0
"I went here on the 16th and it was pretty cool. You go inside this giant ball and it has a couple benches. It fits quite a few people. The tickets we got were ""all you can drink"" and there's a bartender and he makes you what you want...it's not a full bar so don't expect too much. I suggest asking him if he has any special drinks he makes. The bartender that we had made us some ""bartender special"" drinks and they were really good. Bring cash to tip. The ride lasts about a half hour and when you enter the ride, try to stay by the side that you entered...then you can see the strip! The other side doesn't have too much on it. It's cool to do once but I probably wouldn't do it again. Personally, I think it needed to be in a better location. Also, the bartender cut my husband off and he wasn't even drunk lol. They're small cups and a lot of ice. ""All-you-can-drink"" my ass. And no, he wasn't drunk at any point when we got off the ride either so I don't know why he was cut off. My uncle had more drinks than my husband and didn't get cut off.",-1,0
"My boyfriend and I went on the High Roller this past Thursday evening around 10pm. We used a groupon and were able to redeem it easily at guest services. There wasn't a wait at all when we went and we actually had an observation pod to ourselves. The pod next to us was the happy hour pod and it was PACKED with people - they looked like they could barely move. The groupon price is $69 which is basically the price of two night tickets - it's only a deal if you get the happy hour all-you-can-drink option ($109 for two), but beware that you might be packed in like sardines.   There are two benches inside to sit down and you get a 360 degree view through the observation pod windows. It was pretty cool to see the strip all lit up from 550 feet up (if you get lucky you can see the bellagio water fountain show) and there's music playing but the ride is incredibly slow. The entire experience is 30-45 minutes and once you get to the top, coming down is pretty uneventful. There are some screens with a really corny narrator who gives you information about the ride - I wish there was an option to turn him off. We ended up going again on Saturday with my cousins who had free passes. I honestly wouldn't go again unless I was going for free but it's definitely something to experience.",-1,0
"Anxious to see Vegas from many views and perspectives, our party of four jumped at the libation included 550' observation ferris wheel at a price of $60 person -with unlimited opportunities. The ride is 30 minutes in duration and the quantity of guests per cab can go anywhere between; half empty, full and a bit of a challenge to move around. A mood was set when the doors closed and the tender stated; ""the way this works is you help me and I help you"". He started with a too sweet concoction for all and then took limited requests of one's favorite drinks. My analysis... should be closer to $45 ($47 if you purchase on-line), and seen as a one trick pony.",-1,0
This was a fun one time venture. Open bar but weak drinks and a less than accommodating bartender. The service at the Line - concierge however was so great! They helped me with my groupon and app...they gave me water and we're sweet to charge my phone!! We reserved the sunset time and the view is great..A must do for vegas newbies,-1,0
"For someone who has sky dived and still fear heights (they say it's best to conquer your fears by facing it... well, it didn't work for me) this was an exciting and yet scary experience for me. The ride is smooth but as it gets higher and higher so did my blood pressure and sweaty palms. Seemed like everyone else in our cabin was just fine - my family plus another family. Kids and adults were standing on the edge some even leaning against the rail which really made me nervous! The structure and engineer work looks impressive until I noticed there were two bolts missing attaching our cabin to the wheel (I'm sure it was by design but couldn't they have filled those holes?). Plus side -- views were great all around and my kids under 13 rode for free and we got $5 discounts off adult tickets. My recommendation for those who fear heights but still want to go on it, have a drink before going up. Oh and the on boarding off boarding part was interesting -- you walk up to the moving cabin with no safety railings in place (not really) just workers there to guide you -- think if you misstepped and fell over the edge oh man! Luckily there's a safety net in place, however you don't see it until you're in the cabin so you have to kind of take a leap of faith.",-1,0
"$35 for 30 min ride, I was expecting a bit more. After viewing their website, suggesting that you can actually have a "" party"" in these carts, I was expecting to have the cart to our own party. & also a much bigger cart. However, we were crowded with two other parties. Which I thought was unnecessary because 1) our party was a large group of people 2) it was late at night, there was not much people, the cart behind us was EMPTY  it ended up that it wasn't too much of a party atmosphere because the cart was not that huge, there was limited sitting area. Whatever playing on the tv also seems like for kids instead of adults. Also the other group was a group of guys and I guess got really high cuz they saw our huge group of girls. The WHOLE time was trying to talk to us. ehhh....   Also the High Roller actually never stops, so running in and out of the cart freaked me out, since I was with my friends bachelorette, and we were all wearing high heels.   Although the view is great, but I wouldn't pay $35 for this.",-1,0
This review is pretty easy:  Cost $35 for the view you are paying for the view and nothing else. More or less pictures of the view. Oh and hopefully you get in the same pod with some cool people if not that can make or break your round a bout. So it is up to you how much is the view of Vegas worth to you. Night is always better to me because the day time all you see is desert.,-1,0
It was fun~we got the bar 1... be warned.. they dont have red wine.. which was a huge disappointment.. but great views at night!!,-1,0
"A friend and I managed to get a 2 for 1 voucher after joining the Total Rewards program. Really recommend finding promos, online deals, etc. when visiting to save as much as you can and they offer some good deals if you look for them! Since day admission is only $25, we saved a bunch by splitting the cost. Apparently the High Roller is larger than the London Eye, but having ridden both I really couldn't tell the difference. It may be bigger, but there's a lot more to see when you're on top of the London Eye as opposed to just looking over the Strip. The ride took about 30 minutes total and my group and I mostly had the whole pod to ourselves which was nice. They do offer an open bar pod for an additional $10, but since I'm not really a big drinker I doubt I would've taken advantage of that in 30 minutes. From what I witnessed they try to squeeze in as many people that can fit in the bar pods. I was perfectly happy in my quiet pod, lot of space to walk around and take in the views and snap some pictures.",-1,0
"The view is great. The pictures I took were amazing. My selfie stick captured even larger scenic views. The ride last 30 minutes and it gives you a 5 second count down before you hit the peak of height. Not all pods have bars. If you decided to add this option its $10 more and unlimited. I did not purchase the bar options because you are allowed to bring your own drinks as long as not in glass containers. And honestly I was so busy taking pictures, talking, and making memories, I didn't even finish the drink I brought in with me.  *Prices* Before7 pm $26.95 After 7 pm $36.96  $10 added to each for open bar 7 pm and earlier. $15 added after 7 pm.  Once up the escalator, you meet with photographers ready to take your picture which will be available for purchase after. Then walk into a small area with a few pictures on the wall with dates of construction of the wheel and its progress. Check it out, most people by pass it. It's ways good to know some history.   The lines seem longer at night. Sure there is lots of lights, but you don't get to see the city's architecture and layout in such detail. I purchased the before 7pm ticket and rode around 6 pm. This was a great time to see the sights. When purchasing tickets at the kiosk you can not use coupons. Head inside to purchase tickets. I found a $5 off each ticket in my hotel room booklet! Whoo-hoo! Women dressed in lime green will be on the Linq Promenade handing out $2 off coupons. They can not be combined but it's still a savings of you can't get your hands on the $5 off ones. Once off the wheel you are ushered into a gift shop with pictures available for purchase. Omg there some pricy pictures. Lol this gift shop sells full size family size bags of chips! Unnecessary information but funny.  This observation wheel is the largest in the world. It's definitely a must do once. Also make sure you get a coupon. No reason to pay full price. You can earn total reward points by making this purchase but they will not be awarded to you on site. Ask for your receipt and head to your total rewards booth where points will be given then.",-1,0
"We went mid afternoon and got a pod to ourselves - it's a great experience and is higher than any other observation wheel, so you do get a good view.  The commentary is very cheesy but the little ones will love it.  Having done the London Eye several times, I didn't really feel wowed but if you have never done a wheel before it's defiantly worth the trip. Younger kids are free too, so it's good value at $54 for two adults. (Compare that to the London Eye and it's a bargain!!)  $5 open bar is a must try, as well.",-1,0
"Must Read before you go on - make sure you use the restroom before you get on especially if you are drinking.. its about a 30 min ride and you are not getting off. If you are afraid of heights, think twice before you go. You are enclosed so its not like a regular fair ferris wheel that is out in the open with air to help ease your stomach.   Two types of tickets - Full Admission and General   Full Admission (pricey $38 at night) - you get a bar in the center of the pods... fits about 40 people standing. Fun for groups. Even can be a great spot to propose if everyone in there is your friends and family.  General Admission ($10) - no bar open with a little space to sit but still no restroom.  I would have not gone on if I had to pay for the ticket, but since I won the tickets gambling my group decided to try it out. I will not go back on it as I didn't care for it as much. The city lights were beautiful at night but to be enclosed for that long especially when you are drinking was not that great. Also we had a few people that were afraid of heights and ended up feeling sick when they got off... If you must go up bring something salty to eat just in case someone gets queezy..its about 300 ft up the ground.",-1,0
"If you're going to ride the High Roller check Groupon for a deal first. Paying full price (depending on what time you're going and which pod) is just silly. It's 30mins and it goes by pretty fast. I would say it's one of those things you'll ride once and never again. I was in the bar pod, which is all you can drink but you can only have one drink at a time. We made sure to get our moneys worth while in there so we were drinking fast. It was cool to experience it and see the valley like that but again a one time deal for me.",-1,0
"This is a very nice attraction that is definitely worth going on at least once in your life....but you don't ever need to go on it again after that.  First off, it's pricey.  Even for locals.  That right there deters me from wanting to go on it again.  It's not the most comfortable when you're in the pod.  I only had about 20 other people in the pod with me, which is about half of what it CAN hold, yet it was still difficult to move around, and I just wanted to yell, ""MOVE!  You've been hogging the best spot for the whole ride!  Let someone else get a chance!"" to some people.  Also, there is a super annoying guy in the video that plays the entire time you're on the ride.  And it's true: 30 minutes is a long time when you're going a foot a second.  Once you get to the top and see the amazing view, then you're bored out of your mind for the second half as it comes down.  Again, it is worth going on at least once to experience it and see the cool sights, but that's about it.  P.S. They need to invest in some good photo editing equipment.  In the picture my brother and I took, we both had glaring red eyes and looked like Terminators!",-1,0
"TIP: Don't wear high heels here. The High Roller never stops so you're gonna have to jump in and out. If you're not ok with possibly spraining your ankle then wear flats.  The Yelpers before me have already mentioned all the pros - nice view, clean and air-conditioned cabins, and little to no line. BUT we ran into trouble while trying to redeem the Living Social deal we had purchased for a $35 nighttime ticket + free drink. We waited in line at the Guest Services window and the girl told us we had to redeem it at the Linq concierge, a couple doors down. To make a long story short, we found out later that we could've redeemed it at the window we originally were at OR in the main ticket office. I really have no idea why that girl had us go down to the Linq concierge. A regular price ticket is $35 so I don't think all the hassle was worth it for a 30 minute ride.",-1,0
"My friend treat me here and I treat her back with drinks. It was nice, just to experience it even just once. I guess it's a nice place to catch up with friends who are new to the place so they can see around too.",-1,0
"enjoyed the ride and the view from the top.  i think it is worth it - you can get some really cool pictures of vegas from varying angles.  i'm sure right at dusk or late evening would have beautiful views (we went mid-afternoon on a clear day so we could see pretty far out).  the only thing i would say is that it is so new, the price or deals will start popping up... if each person was ~$15-20, it would definitely be right on target - as it stands its probably $10-15 over-priced.  wait a bit and i'm sure there will be deals to be had!",-1,0
"Great experience! Beautiful views of Vegas! The only downfall is that we did the happy hour ride and got Francis as a bartender who was extremely rude and constantly asked for tips. We tipped him over $20 and he made himself more drinks than he made us. Great experience, horrible bartender!",-1,0
Paid extra for the happy half hour. It would not have been so bad but they packed it do you we're practically elbow to elbow.,-1,0
"Teenage daughter loved it.  No line at all on a Thurs night around 9:45pm.  The ride is about 30-40 minutes.  We got a discount online, on Cesear Hotel's website.  Ticket was  $32.  Pricing is a little crazy but it is one of the tallest ferry wheel rides.  Didn't know you can bring drinks on it!  I'm scared of heights but that will definitely take the edge off. Next time!",-1,0
"Review for Happy Half Hour Day experience: our group decided to take part in the happy half hour at the Groupon rate which was reasonable and gave us no trouble when we got there.  There was no big line to get into the attraction except when you get outside to actually get on the High Roller, even then the line moved quickly. It's actually only when you are about to get on you notice that the wheel doesn't stop rotation and you literally have to hop on, which is pretty cool and questionable since we were hopping on to drink!  Now to the nitty gritty, I gave a three because the person I saw the most, Phadrah (however you spell it) the Bartender heavily negatively impacted my experience. I understand she has a job to do but from the beginning I could see she wasn't about being a Bartender just wasting my time. Note this cab can hold up to 40 people so it should be imperative to provide SPEEDY AND FRIENDLY service. If I could call her out her name I would because I felt she put Bartenders to shame and at the same time tried to prevent me from getting the most out of the deal. I've worked in customer service and been a patron to many a bar and not once still I feel she even cared if I was having a good time much less if I felt thirsty. I was basically on the verge of making my own drinks, but stuck to mainly beer so that I wouldn't have to heavily rely on her service. And when we got towards the end she didn't even have the courtesy to do a last call, she simply started talking about how much it was to privately rent it out (really, do we look interested!) and to focus on a video of how the High Roller was built, that she never even put on.... Then to top if off she was giving side eyes before we left with the biggest attitude when a few of us tried to get our last drink before we left (Keep your feelings at home! Don't bring them to work!)   Keep in mind, the views were great and probably would've been better at night but given that I actually drink during Happy Hours I would be a little concerned for my safety during the night ride since you have to jump off at the end. But Overall, a good experience and meeting new intoxicated people is hilarious as well !!!!",-1,0
"I waited for the Groupon before I went on this, 'cause it's pricy. $69 for admission for 2 with either flex pass (go day/night whenever you like) or Happy Half Hour (open bar for the duration of your trip, weekdays only). It also comes with a 20% off food at Brooklyn Bowl, a free polaroid at the Polaroid store, and 15% off any item in the gift shop.  First thing I noticed: everyone here hates their job. The bag checkers could not have cared less about us. I showed my Groupon voucher and the girls says, ""Sorry, I need to see the ticket."" I was like...okay, isn't this a ticket? And she sighs and huffs and puffs and says, ""NO, a REAL ticket. Go to the concierge."" Cryptic and rude! But we went to concierge next to the Brooklyn Bowl and got real tickets printed out and were finally allowed in.  It's a long, long windy path up to the actual High Roller. There's a set of green screens against a wall and some ""photographers"" who basically push you up against the screen, click two pictures, and hand you a ticket without even looking at you. I was really shocked! I gladly would have payed for my picture if it hadn't been so hurried and awful. This is a MONDAY NIGHT, mind you, with NO LINE. They aren't busy, and they just don't care. Terrible customer service.  Finally get there to the loading deck. From my understanding, there are bars in each compartment with bartenders and all. Turns out there's just a small rolling beverage cart they throw in there with a bartender and squeeze a rather large amount of people in one car. Not a lot of seating, which was uncomfortable. Bartender was very friendly.  There's video screens up top of the car that are supposed to give an ""interactive experience"". They don't. They just let you know what elevation you're at and give a small HOORAY! when you reach the pinnacle. The view is pretty, but not worth what we spent. I was ultimately disappointed with the whole experience. Better customer service, please!",-1,0
"Admittedly there are great views up near the top.  We were in a pod with about 12 total so there was lots of room to move around but there were usually people standing against the windows where we wanted to take pictures so we had to wait till they were done to get a photo ourselves.  Tip: stand on the side facing the strip when you get in, which is right when you get in the doors.  And as others said it is not a scary ride at all.  The biggest issue was the price. We went up at night and it was $36.95? per adult. pricey for a half hour ferris wheel ride.  Don't think I'd do this again.",-1,0
